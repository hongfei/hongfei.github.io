    &lt;p&gt;An Idaho man who died of rabies passed the virus to another man through a kidney transplant, marking the fourth known instance in the country in nearly half a century where rabies was transmitted from an organ donor to a recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm#F1_down" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;reported Dec. 4&lt;/a&gt; that the Idaho man was in an outbuilding on his rural property in October 2024 when he was approached by a skunk behaving aggressively. He figured it was because he was holding a kitten, according to the report, which does not identify the man or where he resided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He fought off the skunk, rendering it unconscious, and walked away with a scratch on his shin that bled. But he didn’t think he’d been bitten, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, the man started experiencing hallucinations. He also had a stiff neck, confusion and difficulty swallowing and walking. Two days after his symptoms appeared, he was found unresponsive at home. He was resuscitated and taken to a hospital, but he never regained consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five days in a hospital, he was declared brain dead and removed from life support. His left kidney, heart, lungs and both corneas were recovered for donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His kidney went to a man from Michigan, who received the transplant at a hospital in Ohio. Five weeks later, the man started experiencing tremors, confusion, urinary incontinence and weakness in his legs. He was hospitalized with fever, difficulty swallowing and an extreme fear of water. Clinicians suspected he had rabies, and several samples were sent to the CDC for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week at the hospital, the Michigan man died. Local public health officials interviewed his family, who reported that he had not been exposed to any animals. But the testing showed evidence of rabies in his saliva, skin and brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when the CDC, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and an Idaho public health district began investigating the donor as the source. Health officials tested the Idaho man’s right kidney, which had not been donated, and detected a rabies variant linked to silver-haired bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, three other patients, one each from Idaho, California and New Mexico, received ocular grafts prepared from the Idaho man’s recovered corneas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As officials investigated the donor’s rabies status, the cornea recipients had their grafts removed as a precaution and received post-exposure prophylaxis, a medication taken after potential exposure to rabies to prevent infection. Rabies is almost always fatal without that medication, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cornea recipients remained asymptomatic. Another corneal graft transplant planned for a Missouri patient was canceled. Later, the CDC detected rabies in one of the previously implanted grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is excluded from routine donor pathogen testing in the U.S. because of its rarity in humans and the complexity of diagnostic testing, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, hospital staff who treated the Idaho man were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his symptoms to chronic comorbidities. After rabies was suspected in the Michigan man, a biopsy that had previously been collected from the donor on his third day at the hospital was revisited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare did not immediately respond to a request for details about the Idaho man, including where he lived in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn co-authored the CDC report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;________&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What a joke; I could barely walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once inside, I slumped into an oversized chair and wearily told my new therapist, Elizabeth, my problem was that I sucked at life and the visit would be a waste of time for both of us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only reason I was there was because one of my adult daughters had threatened to call 911 if I didn’t get help for myself. She’d become alarmed after she couldn’t reach me and had stopped by my house, where she discovered me flat on my back on my sofa. I hadn’t bathed or changed my clothes in weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming Elizabeth would show me the door so she could move on to a more worthwhile patient, I was surprised when she instead asked me to elaborate. After listening for nearly an hour, she said, “What you’re suffering from has nothing to do with being bad at life. It’s called resilience fatigue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d never heard of it, but I knew all about resilience. Its necessity had been drummed into my head since I was a kid. “Pull yourself up by your bootstraps ....” “When the going gets tough ....” “If at first you don’t succeed ....” As I saw it, resilience was the crux of my problem. If I wasn’t so weak and lazy, I could allow adversity to transform me into a deeper, tougher individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a lot of work to do,” Elizabeth told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Psychological Association &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/resilience" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="defines resilience" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="693af50fe4b0cfabad28fa40" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.apa.org/topics/resilience" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;defines resilience&lt;/a&gt; as “the process and outcome of successfully adapting to difficult or challenging life experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adapting” is the key word. If stressful events never let up, there’s no time to adapt. Resilience fatigue or toxic stress is about prolonged, excessive and unmanaged intense stress that leads to a sense of being constantly overwhelmed. Without sufficient coping mechanisms, the body’s stress response becomes overworked. This, in turn, can lead to an imbalance in our physiological systems and affect everything from mood to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d been living in a near-constant state of anxiety mixed with dread since April 2000. I’d grown so accustomed to the feeling of impending doom — the racing heart, the perpetual tightness across my shoulders — that I thought it was normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith’s death would have been challenging enough on its own, but overnight I also became a single mother of three. Worse still, I was pregnant with our fourth child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that was just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and Keith on their wedding day, March 4, 1989.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith had minimal life insurance. I’d been a stay-at-home mother for almost a decade while we continually moved for his job as he climbed the corporate ladder. Even before I buried him, the realization that I’d have to find both work and child care ASAP filled me with terror. A family of five had to have health insurance. We’d been insured through Keith’s employer, and I couldn’t afford to pay for it outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding work took precedence over everything, including grieving my husband and bonding with the baby born three weeks after he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d always assumed the capacity for resilience was limitless and also hardwired into human beings like the fight-or-flight response, but during my counseling sessions, I learned otherwise. It’s not innate; rather, it’s learned and comes not just from individual effort but also from available support and resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The times I attempted to discuss my fears or concerns with others, they dismissed them: “You’re young, you’ll bounce back ....” “God never gives you more than you can handle ....” “In a few years you’ll remarry and hopefully the next guy will be rich ....” This was what passed for support in my world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, I believed grit and determination would not only save me but someday I’d look back on those terrible days and be thankful for what I’d gone through while reflecting on how far I’d come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a hot minute, that seemed to be the case. After an obsessive job search, I found a position in an auto insurance call center with top-notch benefits. My parents, who’d recently retired and had moved nearby, agreed to watch my kids and not charge me. I began humming the song “I Will Survive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the job turned into a trap. Callers were frequently angry; they swore and shouted at me all day. There was little room for advancement unless I could put in overtime or travel, which was impossible given my situation. I’d leave work depressed and drained and come home to a messy house full of bickering kids and memories of the life I used to love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also began flashing back to the morning I found Keith dead in our bed. As time passed, I thought about him more instead of less, and I couldn’t understand why the last day of his life played on a constant loop in my head, as if I could change the outcome if I relived it enough times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned this to a relative, she chastised me. “You need to focus on all the good things you still have, not on the bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course I was grateful for what I had, despite the fact that my finances were eroding at a frighteningly rapid pace. Despite the fact that I’d gone from enjoying a vibrant, hope-filled life with a man I loved to living like a cloistered nun. Despite the fact that one day my future had beckoned like the yellow brick road and the next there was a ROAD PERMANENTLY CLOSED sign blocking the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author's family on their last family vacation in 1999. "Keith had less than a year to live," the author writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of all I was grateful for my parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their mid-60s, they were now practically raising a toddler and an infant. I was tired all the time and so were they. Our relationship deteriorated even as I suffered crushing guilt over what they were doing for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet I was certain I could turn everything around. So I prayed daily for acceptance of my situation. “The Secret” became my Bible, and I spewed positive affirmations morning, noon and night. I tried to banish negative thoughts from my head and focus on future abundance, not what I’d lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing changed. Eventually I went through bankruptcy followed by foreclosure. I was fired from my job for not being able to keep up with the ever-changing metrics. When I discovered my oldest daughter was using heroin, I thought life could not get any worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father developed Alzheimer’s disease, and I moved in with my parents to help care for him. Two years after he died, my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and I took care of her until the end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then my daughter was no longer using heroin, which was an unexpected miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at that point my younger daughter was in trouble for school truancy and drug use. Eventually she was removed from my home by Franklin County Children Services after her high school filed a criminal complaint with the local juvenile court and a judge ruled that she be placed in foster care at a local psychiatric residential treatment facility. It was a good thing I was unemployed, as my days became a merry-go-round of mandatory meetings with social workers, psychiatrists, counselors and a court-appointed guardian. They picked apart my life and told me everything I was doing wrong as a parent but offered nothing in terms of concrete solutions or support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My daughter was gone for over two years. Upon her return, she told me she’d been sexually assaulted while she was at the treatment facility. Guilt for what she’d been through vied with an impotent sense of rage deep inside me. The feelings were so inflammatory that sometimes I was sure I’d self-combust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of my ongoing crises, I met a man in a writers’ group I’d joined in an attempt to get away from my life. Jim became a bright beacon in my otherwise dreary existence, so much so that I dared to envision a future with him. But three months after my mother passed, he died by suicide in my car. My younger son, who’d adored Jim, was so traumatized he had to be hospitalized after he became suicidal. My older son ghosted me for several years, deeming me a toxic mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could no longer deny that my life had become a not-so-funny running joke, with me as the punchline. Sometimes I imagined my husband disgustedly shaking his head as he watched his family fall apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just thinking about it exhausted me. One day I lay down on my living room sofa and couldn’t find the strength to rise again. I prayed for death as I thought about how I’d failed everyone, including myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth helped me to reframe my viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your husband died, then you had a baby. You had to hit the ground running with no time to grieve him or help your children. Your life became a runaway train that took 17 years to crash,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She put me in touch with a psychiatric nurse who prescribed a combination of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications. She also utilized cognitive therapy, including EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing). Slowly I began to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her youngest daughter, Dianna. "She was born three weeks after her father died," the author writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course you can’t always control what life throws at you, but Elizabeth pointed out that my path might have taken a different turn if I hadn’t been forced into a race against time to secure health insurance and child care, those fickle twins that dictate life for so many Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, I had trouble letting go of the conviction that I’d traded in resilience for lethargy. All my life I’d heard that adversity builds character and that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elizabeth shook her head. “Those are dangerous generalizations and they’re mostly false. Beliefs like that allow us to minimize other peoples’ suffering without feeling guilt.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A growing body of research shows that despite the widespread belief that negative life events result in “post-traumatic growth” or positive personality change, “the only type of growth that seems to arise consistently is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://spsp.org/news-center/character-context-blog/does-adversity-really-make-us-stronger-usually-not#:~:text=The%20only%20type%20of%20growth,intimate%2C%20meaningful%2C%20and%20rewarding." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="deepened relationships" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="693af50fe4b0cfabad28fa40" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://spsp.org/news-center/character-context-blog/does-adversity-really-make-us-stronger-usually-not#:~:text=The%20only%20type%20of%20growth,intimate%2C%20meaningful%2C%20and%20rewarding." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;deepened relationships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” according to the Society for Personality and Social Psychology&lt;span&gt;. Our relationships with loved ones often become more meaningful during times of struggle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“But that requires having supportive relationships in the first place,” Elizabeth said. “Other than your parents, who were tossed out of the frying pan into the fire with you, you’ve been going it alone all this time. What would you say to that relative who told you Keith’s death would make you stronger if you saw her today?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I didn’t hesitate. “I’d say, ‘You have no idea how badly I wish you’d been right.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seven years on, my own mental health is in a much better place, and my children are thriving. We’re closer than we’ve ever been, and all four are involved in healthy relationships and working at jobs they enjoy. My older daughter became a psychiatric nurse and the younger one is pursuing a nursing degree in the same field. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After my oldest child went through a divorce a few years ago, I began watching my two young grandchildren while she worked, paying it forward the way my parents did for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I understand the urge to offer platitudes to someone who’s experienced a loss or tragedy. The right words can be difficult to find. But it’s better to say nothing than to imply they’ll somehow benefit or be improved as a result of their misfortune.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suffering hasn’t made me stronger, but it certainly has taught me about the kind of person I want to be. Now I’m able to offer more than platitudes to others going through difficult times because I can share my experience along with empathy. Pain does not build resilience; lending support does, even if it’s only a sympathetic ear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m grateful that today I can be that support for my family.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was originally published in December 2024 and we are sharing it again now as part of HuffPost Personal’s “Best Of” series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margaret Jan Feike’s personal essays concerning subjects such as addiction, mental health, and grief have been published by Salon, McSweeney’s, Modern Loss, and other venues.

That means coughing into a bent elbow, or using a tissue that is quickly disposed of in the nearest bin. People are advised to wash their hands frequently with warm water and soap, and to clean their “surroundings often, especially areas that are touched frequently such as door handles”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Several hospital trusts have reinstated masks for staff, patients and visitors in clinical areas.

Surgical masks can reduce exposure to droplets and aerosols. However, they are primarily designed for “source control” — that is, preventing the wearer from spreading large droplets. Homemade cloth masks are also likely to be less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="6.7"&gt;&lt;div id="341f0de2-7cd7-48f7-9852-e717fab3d7d6"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;The FFP2 mask&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Reviews of the evidence point to a general trend: proper mask use is associated with lower transmission of respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For instance, one “meta study” — a study of studies — published in the journal Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness in 2023 brought together the results of seven previous pieces of research. It concluded that mask-wearing in community settings — those studied ranged from university residence halls to Hajj pilgrimages and ordinary households — was linked to a 17 per cent decrease in the risk of catching an “influenza-like illness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Studies suggest protection will be stronger when masks are used consistently and combined with other measures such as proper hand washing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;During the Covid-19 pandemic many people got used to wearing masks in the UK, where they had previously been a rare sight, even during nasty flu outbreaks. A review of studies carried out during the pandemic, overseen by Wanderley Marques Bernardo of the Brazilian Medical Association, suggested that masks helped to prevent Covid infections, but came with the warning that most of those studies were of low quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cf9ee5a4-7829-45ce-a299-3fa354dedd3a" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Do mandates work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The evidence here is less clear-cut. Making masks compulsory can only work insofar as the public sticks to the rules. Another meta study published last year in the journal Clinical Microbiology Reviews concluded they can help reduce infections. The benefits will vary with mask quality and how they are used, however. That study also pointed out that “masks are not generally harmful to the general population” but noted that some groups, notably deaf people, were disadvantaged when others were masked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For now, ministers show no appetite for broad legal requirements. The emphasis remains on voluntary action and personal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a0cc69e8-c871-46c9-8e0f-24de1a173bdc" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;What type of mask should you use?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For personal protection, products such as N95 or FFP2 masks are the gold standard. Surgical masks provide less protection but can be more comfortable for longer wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7fd65d4c-7ce6-41e9-add0-5c6e372e7d5f" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;How to wear a mask properly?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A well-fitted mask is far more effective. Hands should be washed properly before putting a mask on, and the mask must cover both nose and mouth with no gaps at the sides. Avoid touching the front while wearing it. Disposable masks should be discarded after use. Remove masks using the straps rather than the face covering itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 14:20:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQelQ2Mzh6RTRxa0xKMUdNNW1CZUhQX0M3VWYwSVFmZ1hmbG4xSFlVd0xxc1J6QjR3dmFsT3hGOEN6QW5hN251dWtqOWFzUFRVLVQ5WVFGNkI1WU81ME1iUHI3Y0hhU2QtVkRNSVN4clRTNnJFN3gzWThhbzdVNFFmQTFjRnNOem5HNDdaYUFmY2FRQQ</guid></item><item><title>你身边有神秘的“2025喉咙病毒”吗？可能是这样的。- NJ.com</title><link>https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2025/12/do-you-have-the-mystery-2025-throat-virus-going-around-heres-what-it-could-be.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X2VSSZ4YABFYJI366QPV57JDMI"&gt;TikTok, X, and Instagram are flooded with videos about a mysterious “2025 throat virus” that’s making everyone sick.

			&lt;p&gt;What you gain in a day by staying up late might be curtailing how long you live, according to a new study linking insufficient sleep to a lower life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While poor sleep has been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-to-100-these-four-habits-might-help-get-you-there"&gt;previously linked&lt;/a&gt; to a host of health issues and shorter lifespans, this latest investigation found that getting enough shut-eye had a stronger connection to living longer than diet and exercise – factors that are known to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-can-add-10-years-to-your-life-simply-by-changing-your-diet-massive-study-finds"&gt;add years&lt;/a&gt; to your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University (OHSU) crunched the numbers on survey data from across the US, covering the years 2019 to 2025. Measures of life expectancy were compared against self-reported evaluations of sleep duration, with less than seven hours per night considered a threshold for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-found-an-alarming-pattern-in-the-brains-of-sleep-deprived-kids"&gt;insufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-gut-could-be-quietly-controlling-your-sleep-research-shows"&gt;Your Gut Could Be Quietly Controlling Your Sleep, Research Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then factored in other variables that can affect life expectancy, including physical inactivity, employment status, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-017-0381-x"&gt;educational level&lt;/a&gt;. The association between insufficient sleep and lower life expectancy still held. Only smoking had a stronger link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't expect [insufficient sleep] to be so strongly correlated to life expectancy," &lt;a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2025/12/08/insufficient-sleep-associated-with-decreased-life-expectancy"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; OHSU sleep physiologist Andrew McHill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've always thought sleep is important, but this research really drives that point home: people really should strive to get seven to nine hours of sleep if at all possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184827" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184827" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/SleepChart.jpg" alt="Sleep chart" class="wp-image-184827 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/SleepChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/SleepChart-600x310.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184827" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Life expectancy's association with sleep is stronger than with many other factors, including diet and exercise. Although, as this graph shows, physical activity and social connections also influence life expectancy. (McAuliffe et al., &lt;em&gt;Sleep Adv.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a purely observational study, the research can't prove that less sleep knocks months or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-time-of-day-you-eat-in-later-life-could-foreshadow-an-early-death"&gt;years off your life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study like this also can't untangle the complex interactions between sleep, diet, and exercise. The results do suggest the amount of sleep you get each night is a significant indicator of long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adequate sleep is vital for almost every aspect of our well-being: missing a single night of slumber can impact &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;brain circuitry&lt;/a&gt; and the body's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-just-one-nights-sleep-changes-your-immune-system-study-finds"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-existing-vaccine-could-slow-dementia-and-cut-death-risk-by-30"&gt;An Existing Vaccine Could Slow Dementia And Cut Death Risk by 30%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not unreasonable to suggest that such health issues may contribute to mortality in the long run. In particular, the researchers highlight obesity and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="184824" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; as two conditions linked with poor sleep that could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-order-you-get-diseases-can-shape-your-life-expectancy"&gt;reduce life expectancy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's intuitive and makes a lot of sense, but it was still striking to see it materialize so strongly in all of these models," &lt;a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2025/12/08/insufficient-sleep-associated-with-decreased-life-expectancy"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; McHill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting a good night's sleep will improve how you feel but also how long you live."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that our sleep routines are, at least to some extent, modifiable within the limits of our caregiving and work commitments. It might be worth quitting that habit of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-what-doomscrolling-is-doing-to-your-brain-and-how-to-fix-the-problem"&gt;doomscrolling in bed&lt;/a&gt;, or squeezing in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-improves-sleep-the-most-study-finds"&gt;session of yoga&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-can-improve-sleep-long-term-study-finds"&gt;tai chi&lt;/a&gt; now and then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society recommend &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.4758"&gt;banking at least seven hours&lt;/a&gt; of sleep a night, although there is some evidence that you might be able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weekend-lie-ins-could-save-you-from-an-early-death"&gt;catch up on the weekends&lt;/a&gt; if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This research shows that we need to prioritize sleep at least as much as we do what we eat or how we exercise," &lt;a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2025/12/08/insufficient-sleep-associated-with-decreased-life-expectancy"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; McHill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleepadvances/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sleepadvances/zpaf090/8373869?login=false"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleep Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have a medical question you'd like to get a doctor's answer honest answer to?  Dr. Mara Gordon, a family physician in Camden, N.J., answers reader health questions monthly. Write us at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:thrive@npr.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;thrive@npr.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Question: I've heard there's a self test to check for cervical cancer. I hate getting Pap smears. Is this a safe alternative?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I hear you: Pap smears are &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;fun. At best, they're uncomfortable. At worst, they can be deeply upsetting for people who've experienced sexual or medical trauma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a primary care doctor, I also know how important it is that my patients get checked for early signs of cervical cancer, the most &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.35369" target="_blank"&gt;common gynecological cancer worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally, a doctor would do this with a Pap smear, which involves collecting a sample of cells from your cervix.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But a new approach is starting to be available. You can get tested for HPV — or human papilloma virus — which causes cervical cancer. In fact, &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.70041" target="_blank"&gt;new recommendations&lt;/a&gt; out this month from the American Cancer Society say that patients can safely swab their own vaginas to collect samples for the test, rather than undergo an invasive pelvic exam.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;blockquote class="edTag"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Submit your health and medical questions at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:thrive@npr.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;thrive@npr.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and we’ll consider them for the next Real Talk With A Doc column.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the new approach isn't widely available yet. Here's what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How HPV testing works to detect cancer risk&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HPV is like the common cold of sex. If you've ever had sex, you've almost certainly been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I say, 'You know, it's &lt;em&gt;human &lt;/em&gt;papillomavirus, so everybody who's a human is going to get it at one point or another,'" said &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/Rebecca-Perkins" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Perkins,&lt;/a&gt; an OB/GYN at Tufts University. "We just need to worry about it if it doesn't go away."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just like most people fight off unpleasant winter colds, the immune system is also great at fighting off HPV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But if your body can't, your risk of cervical cancer increases. That's why testing for high-cancer-risk strains of HPV is a good way to identify people who could go on to develop cancer. (It's also why doctors' groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/immunizations/human-papillomavirus-vaccines/" target="_blank"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; all kids get vaccinated for it between the ages of 9 and 12.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If you do test positive for high-risk HPV, you'll need follow up testing — either with a repeat HPV test or a procedure called a colposcopy, which allows a clinician to examine the cervix under a microscope and take biopsies if needed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;HPV testing is more effective&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HPV testing detects 90% to 95% of pre-cancerous abnormalities, according to Perkins. She is the lead author of new guidelines from the American Cancer Society that help doctors decide how and when to test their patients for cervical cancer. Pap smears, Perkins added, only detect about 70% to 80% of pre-cancers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Let's break down the difference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a Pap smear, a patient undergoes a genital exam with a doctor or nurse. The clinician puts a speculum inside the patient's vagina so she can see the patient's cervix — the bottom of the uterus — and twirls a plastic brush around to collect cervical cells. Those cells are then transported to a lab, where they're evaluated under a microscope to look for abnormalities that can be an early sign of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An HPV test can be done by a doctor or a patient herself. If a doctor does it, it's similar to a Pap smear and involves a speculum exam. That's called a "clinician-collected" test. But a vaginal self-swab is exactly what it sounds like. The patient puts a swab into her own vagina to collect a sample that then is sent to a lab.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many people prefer to swab themselves. It can feel less invasive than an exam done by a doctor, and there's no speculum, which can be uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society's new guidelines include vaginal self-swab as a safe and accurate form of cervical cancer screening. They say anyone who has a cervix should get HPV testing between the ages of 25 and 65. If a doctor does the swab, it should happen every five years. If a patient does it herself, it's every three.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Self-swabbing is not yet widely available &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In May of 2025, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/10/nx-s1-5394446/fda-cervical-cancer-screening-at-home-tool-pap-smear" target="_blank"&gt;at-home kit for HPV testing&lt;/a&gt;. It's proprietary and can only be used through a telehealth company called Teal Health, which charges $99 in addition to billing a patient's insurance plan. Your primary care doctor can't order it for you.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That means that most patients still have to go into brick-and-mortar clinics for cervical cancer screening, even if the patients are doing the swabbing themselves. There, they could undergo either a clinician-collected test or swab themselves in a clinic restroom. At this point, not all doctors offer the self-swab option, but ask yours if they do.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I asked Perkins why I couldn't just order a vaginal self-swab test for my patients and tell them to do it at home rather than making them come in.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The answer comes down to transportation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine you have someone in rural Texas in July [who] does their self-swab, sticks it in the mailbox. The mailbox now hits 200 degrees," says Perkins. "Then it's in the mail truck, then it gets to the lab. It has to still be valid."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As of now, Teal Health is the only company that offers a test proven to be accurate under such a wide range of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A self-swab done in a doctor's office restroom, on the other hand, involves different equipment that will be transported to a lab right away and be kept at a stable temperature.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if it still means a trip to the clinic, many people prefer this to a speculum exam. It can be less painful and it can give the patient a sense of control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Insurance often doesn't cover it&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many doctors still do Paps instead of HPV-only testing — including me! That's because HPV-only testing requires specific equipment — and even though it's better, it isn't covered by most health insurance plans.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If it's better, why won't insurers pay for it? It's mostly because &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;HPV-only testing is not yet recommended&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government body that issues guidelines about primary care. Perkins says that the USPSTF tends to follow the American Cancer Society recommendations eventually — it just lags by a few years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that their recommendations about cervical cancer screening are currently being updated. Many experts, including Perkins, expect the new guidelines will include HPV-only testing, although it's unclear when they will be issued.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many insurers only pay for what the UPSTF recommends, says Perkins.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Keep up your screenings in your 50s and 60s &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Older women typically don't see gynecologists as frequently as patients in their peak reproductive years. These patients may miss recommended screenings, so if doctors do find cervical cancer, it tends to be more advanced.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Older women tend to have &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244028" target="_blank"&gt;much higher mortality from cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt; compared to those who are younger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Perkins is optimistic that self-swab options will eventually make cervical cancer screening more accessible for this age group.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Perkins says the older screening guidelines are also partially to blame for older women missing screenings — they're unnecessarily complicated. In those guidelines, frequency of testing follows an algorithm based on &lt;em&gt;past &lt;/em&gt;test results, which can be hard to track down if a patient switches doctors or goes several years without care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Perkins hopes that a move to simplified HPV-only testing will make it easier for older patients to get screened, with clinician-collected testing at age 60 and again at age 65 regardless of past results.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Gordon works at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University.

Kennedy Jr. pledged that the search for autism’s cause — a question that has kept researchers busy for the better part of six decades — would be over in just five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic, and we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures,” Kennedy &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQDUFDnkfpA" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told President Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during a Cabinet meeting in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ambitious deadline has come and gone. But researchers and advocates say that Kennedy’s continued fixation on autism’s origins — and his &lt;a class="link" href="https://time.com/7210943/rfk-confirmation-hearing-vaccines/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;frequent, inaccurate claims&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that childhood vaccines are somehow involved — is built on fundamental misunderstandings of the complex neurodevelopmental condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after more than half a century of research, no one yet knows exactly why some people have autistic traits and others do not, or why autism spectrum disorder looks so different across the people who have it. But a few key themes have emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that autism is most likely the result of a complex set of interactions between genes and the environment that unfold while a child is in the womb. It can be passed down through families, or originate with a spontaneous gene mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental influences may indeed play a role in some autism cases, but their effect is heavily influenced by a person’s genes. There is no evidence for a single trigger that causes autism, and certainly not one a child encounters after birth: not a vaccine, a parenting style or a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-circumcision-linked-autism-experts/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;post-circumcision Tylenol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The real reason why it’s complicated, the more fundamental one, is that there’s not a single cause,” said &lt;a class="link" href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/medical-center/team/802/irva-hertz-picciotto---environmental-and-occupational-health---epidemiologic-methods-davis/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Irva Hertz-Picciotto&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of public health science and director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at UC Davis. “It’s not a single cause from one person to the next, and not a single cause within any one person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, an attorney who has no medical or scientific training, has called research into autism’s genetics a “dead end.” Autism researchers counter that it’s the only logical place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we know nothing else, we know that autism is primarily genetic,” said Joe Buxbaum, a molecular neuroscientist who directs the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “And you don’t have to actually have the exact genes [identified] to know that something is genetic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some neurodevelopment disorders arise from a difference in a single gene or chromosome. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, for example, and Fragile X syndrome results when the FMR1 gene isn’t expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism in most cases is polygenetic, which means that multiple genes are involved, with each contributing a little bit to the overall picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found &lt;a class="link" href="https://medschool.ucla.edu/news-article/is-autism-genetic#:~:text=However%2C%20an%20estimated%20200%20%2D%201%2C000,valporic%20acid%2C%20are%20relatively%20rare." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hundreds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of genes that could be associated with autism; there may be many more among the roughly 20,000 in the human genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the strongest evidence that autism is genetic comes from studies of twins and other sibling groups, Buxbaum and other researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of autism in the U.S. general population is about 2.8%, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/press_releases/updates-sibling-recurrence-rates-of-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study published last year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Pediatrics. Among children with at least one autistic sibling, it’s 20.2% — about seven times higher than the general population, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twin studies reinforce the point. Both identical and fraternal twins develop in the same womb and are usually raised in similar circumstances in the same household. The difference is genetic: identical twins share 100% of their genetic information, while fraternal twins share about 50% (the same as nontwin siblings).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one fraternal twin is autistic, the chance that the other twin is also autistic is about 20%, or about the same as it would be for a nontwin sibling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if one in a pair of identical twins is autistic, the chance that the other twin is also autistic is significantly higher. Studies have pegged the identical twin concurrence rate anywhere from 60% to 90%, though the intensity of the twins’ autistic traits may differ significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular genetic studies, which look at the genetic information shared between siblings and other blood relatives, have found similar rates of genetic influence on autism, said Dr. John Constantino, a professor of pediatrics, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Emory University School of Medicine and chief of behavioral and mental health at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, he said, “those studies have indicated that a vast share of the causation of autism can be traced to the effects of genetic influences. That is a fact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buxbaum compares the heritability of autism to the heritability of height, another polygenic trait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s not one gene that’s making you taller or shorter,” Buxbaum said. Hundreds of genes play a role in where you land on the height distribution curve. A lot of those genes run in families — it’s not unusual for very tall people, for example, to have very tall relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But parents pass on a random mix of their genes to their children, and height distribution across a group of same-sex siblings can vary widely. Genetic mutations can change the picture. Marfan syndrome, a condition caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, typically makes people grow taller than average. Hundreds of genetic mutations are associated with dwarfism, which causes shorter stature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then once a child is born, external factors such as malnutrition or disease can affect the likelihood that they reach their full height potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So genes are important. But the environment — which in developmental science means pretty much anything that isn’t genetics, including parental age, nutrition, air pollution and viruses — can play a major role in how those genes are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genetics does not operate in a vacuum, and at the same time, the impact of the environment on people is going to depend on a person’s individual genetics,” said Brian K. Lee, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Drexel University who studies the genetics of developmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the childhood circumstances that can affect height, the environmental exposures associated with autism for the most part take place in utero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified multiple factors linked to increased risks of the disorder, including older parental age, infant prematurity and parental exposure to air pollution and industrial solvents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigations into some of these linkages were among the more than 50 autism-related studies whose funding Kennedy has cut since taking office, a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/rfk-jr-autism-environment-research-funding" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ProPublica investigation found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, no credible study has found links between vaccines and autism — and there have been many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One move from  the Department of Health and Human Services has been met with cautious optimism: even as Kennedy slashed funding to other research projects, the department in September announced &lt;a class="link" href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/autism-data-science-initiative/funded-research" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/autism-data-science-initiative/funded-research" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$50-million &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/autism-data-science-initiative/funded-research" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;initiative&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to explore the interactions of genes and environmental factors in autism, which has been divided among 13 different research groups at U.S. universities, including UCLA and UC San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department’s selection of well-established, legitimate research teams was met with relief by many autism scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many say they fear that such decisions will be an anomaly under Kennedy, who has repeatedly rejected facts that don’t conform to his preferred hypotheses, elevated shoddy science and muddied public health messaging on autism with inaccurate information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disagreements are an essential part of scientific inquiry. But the productive ones take place in a universe of shared facts and build on established evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when determining how to spend limited resources, researchers say, making evidence-based decisions is vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are two aspects of these decisions: Is it a reasonable expenditure based on what we already know? And if you spend money here, will you be taking money away from HHS that people are in desperate need of?” Constantino said. “If you’re going to be spending money, you want to do that in a way that is not discarding what we already know.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9peDRkMHNpbjZpcG45cHV6Q1ozNjVIcHRLSFVuMUxPeGlpSjJ6dWk2aU43YWQxWlF3cFpDbTBkcXdfY1MtTG9tQUxPdDNnSHYyWFZJcEF0NE11SC1ETWxMcEE5YS1vdWQzRzl0cEQ2OGNILVE</guid></item><item><title>感觉每个人都在服用GLP-1 ？不仅仅是减肥- MindBodyGreen</title><link>https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/metabolism-meets-longevity-promise-of-glp-1-drugs</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span id="content"&gt;&lt;div end="false" class="sc-11rlt5o-4 gjIquG"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, the average biohacker routine looked the same: morning sunlight, red light therapy, cold plunges, infrared saunas, and breathwork.

They had access to deidentified records of demographic information and health care use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this group of over 1 million people, researchers selected 9,919 individuals who had restless leg syndrome based on a specific code for restless leg syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They specifically included individuals who had at least two instances of documented outpatient diagnoses of restless leg syndrome. They then matched this group with a control group that did not have restless leg syndrome. About 63% of each group were women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers defined Parkinson’s disease based on two codes and compared the incidence of Parkinson’s disease in the two groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also wanted to explore how pathways related to dopamine played into the outcomes. For this reason, they took into account participants with restless leg syndrome who received &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/dopamine-agonists" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dopamine agonist treatment&lt;/a&gt; and those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine agonists are a common treatment for restless leg syndrome, and the authors note that Parkinson’s disease is also treated with dopaminergic agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers assumed that participants who were treated with dopamine agonists had primary restless leg syndrome, while those who did not receive this treatment were assumed to have secondary restless leg syndrome, where symptoms are more likely to be relieved with treatment of underlying problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of covariates, researchers considered components like having a history of sleep disorders. The group with restless leg syndrome had a higher prevalence of sleeping disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The group with restless leg syndrome had a higher incidence of Parkinson’s disease, and over a 15-year timeframe, was more likely to receive Parkinson’s disease diagnoses sooner. Overall, researchers found that having restless leg syndrome was linked to a higher chance of someone developing Parkinson’s disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers considered treatment with dopamine agonists, about 3,000 participants received dopamine agonist treatment, while the rest of the participants with restless leg syndrome did not receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group that received treatment with dopamine agonists had a lower cumulative incidence rate of Parkinson’s disease and a longer time until diagnosis compared to the control group. In contrast, the cumulative incidence of Parkinson’s disease among the non-treatment group was higher than that of the control group, and the time until diagnosis was shorter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research does have noted limitations. First, it only focused on Korean individuals, limiting generalizability. Second, underdiagnosis, overdiagnosis, and misdiagnosis of both Parkinson’s disease and restless leg syndrome are possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, this study cannot determine causal relationships, and more research in this area will likely be necessary to identify possible causal relationships between Parkinson’s disease and restless leg syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of time before diagnosis in the 15-year timeframe, there was less than a year difference between all of the groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also limits to the researchers’ groups of restless leg syndrome participants. The authors note discontinuation of dopamine agonists in the non-dopamine agonist group could account for the higher incidence of Parkinson’s disease in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that this group further contained individuals who had conditions besides primary restless leg syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers made the assumption that the dopamine agonist group was made up of primary cases of restless leg syndrome and the non-dopamine agonist group was made up of cases of secondary restless leg syndrome. However, it is possible that this was not the case, and that some people discontinued dopamine agonist treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors further acknowledge that the research cannot confirm “shared dopaminergic pathway dysfunction between [restless leg syndrome] and [Parkinson’s disease].” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, researchers in this study regarded restless leg syndrome not to be “a prodromal manifestation of” Parkinson’s disease and thus considered the use of dopamine agonists to be a way to treat symptoms rather than protective measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They admit that if they had regarded restless leg syndrome as an early beginning to Parkinson’s disease, that “DAs [dopaminergic agents] might have been considered to exert a neuroprotective effect in preventing progression to PD [Parkinson’s disease].” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neurology-neurosurgery/guy-rouleau-oc-oq-md-phd-frcpc-frsc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Guy Roleau&lt;/a&gt;, OC, OQ, MD, PhD&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Chair of the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University in Canada, who was not involved in this research, noted several limitations of the research to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no known shared genetic risk between [Parkinson’s disease] and [restless leg syndrome], and Mendelian randomisation studies also show no link between the two diseases, suggesting no causative link between the two diseases,“ Roleau told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a retrospective study using diagnostic codes, so there are many potential sources for errors. The most obvious is that people with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7554050/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;REM Behaviour Disorder (RBD)&lt;/a&gt; [which can affect people with Parkinson’s disease] can easily be misdiagnosed with [restless leg syndrome]. We know that most patients with RBD go on to develop [Parkinson’s disease]. So this could lead, at least in part, to the association they see. Also, the different finding for [restless leg syndrome] treated and not treated with dopamine agonist is troubling. I suspect that if they put all the [restless leg syndrome] together, their finding may not be significant.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is required on this topic, the results suggest that restless leg syndrome could be a risk factor for Parkinson’s disease. Identifying restless leg syndrome may help identify individuals most at risk for Parkinson’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research can explore the neuroprotective effects of dopamine agonists and how restless leg syndrome and Parkinson’s disease truly relate to one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research into how dopamine relates to everything may be useful as well. The authors suggest that because the group that did not receive treatment with dopamine agonists tended to have a greater risk for Parkinson’s disease, “the association between [restless leg syndrome] and [Parkinson’s] might not be due to the dopaminergic pathway.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://siliconpsych.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Alex Dimitriu&lt;/a&gt;, MD, double board-certified in Psychiatry and Sleep Medicine and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry &amp;amp; Sleep Medicine, likewise not involved in the study, told us:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am not sure I agree with the authors that dopamine may not be the single agent responsible for the [restless leg syndrome]- Parkinson’s relationship. In my professional work, I have seen dopamine-related conditions go hand in hand with others. Specifically, people who have akathisia (restlessness) with dopamine blocking meds, also tend to have [restless leg syndrome]. And patients with [restless leg syndrome] are more likely to develop tremor and akathisia (all symptoms of lower dopamine).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 06:49:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPNDFscVNpTmR2NUNKd3hTZWd1VXdGZUlYbGpIX2MtR09oLVVFZ1MtbktDdngtWHY5N0E2MjA1UUFRNFJtLTFfM0w0R2hwNmNFRUxNRmdTVXdhTDZKNmhhb1laWVBsdE94SmxiOW5aX09jZXoydVp2MTE3U1l2SHFMd01BblFtNHBwNWNWeE9zZlFQUlFSWTZpMWkwZjhpN2ZNS3c</guid></item><item><title>拥有20年经验的加州心脏病专家分享如何“在紧急情况发生前捕捉早期心脏信号” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/california-cardiologist-with-20-years-of-experience-shares-how-to-catch-early-cardiac-signals-before-an-emergency-101765434307439.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/california-cardiologist-with-20-years-of-experience-shares-how-to-catch-early-cardiac-signals-before-an-emergency-101765434307439.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A common refrain among patients who have just experienced a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-shares-real-reasons-even-fit-sporty-people-suffer-heart-attacks-sudden-cardiac-arrest-during-workout-indian-101756973611052.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiac scare"&gt;cardiac scare&lt;/a&gt; is, “I never saw the signs.” &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Now, a California cardiologist with 20 years of experience has shared a simple framework he developed to help people interpret the ‘silent warnings’ their bodies may be sending.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/orthopaedic-surgeon-shares-how-a-29-year-old-healthy-young-man-suffers-sudden-cardiac-arrest-no-symptoms-smoking-alcohol-101754559195167.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Orthopaedic surgeon shares how 29-year-old ‘healthy young man’ died from sudden cardiac arrest: ‘No smoking, no alcohol’"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orthopaedic surgeon shares how 29-year-old ‘healthy young man’ died from sudden cardiac arrest: ‘No smoking, no alcohol’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/11/550x309/406902_1758255027716_1758255225201_1765434645562.jpg" alt="Dr. Sanjay Bhojraj’s H.E.A.R.T.

He added that these patients were often engaged in seemingly healthy habits, such as &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fitness-coach-shares-6-hacks-to-stay-in-shape-while-working-a-40-hour-week-choose-3-4-meal-101765104422257.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="exercising and eating healthy"&gt;exercising and eating healthy&lt;/a&gt;, yet their bodies were still sending warnings they didn't know how to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Introducing the H.E.A.R.T. method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this critical gap, Dr Bhojraj shared that he created the H.E.A.R.T. method, a five-step framework designed to help people catch early cardiac signals before they escalate into an emergency. He said, “I created the H.E.A.R.T. method, a simple framework to help you catch early cardiac signals before they become an emergency.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's what he said about the H.E.A.R.T. method:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;H: Hidden patterns notice subtle shifts – fatigue,&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/irregular-sleep-linked-to-172-diseases-including-diabetes-kidney-failure-and-parkinson-s-finds-largest-ever-study-101753784139655.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="disrupted sleep"&gt; disrupted sleep&lt;/a&gt;, shortness of breath you blame on 'being out of shape'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;E: Everyday symptoms – track recurring chest tightness, jaw or arm discomfort, or heart flutters — even if they feel mild.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A: Ask better questions – not “Is this serious?” but “Is this new, persistent, or getting worse?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;R: Risk reality – check stress, genetics, diet, and lifestyle compound quietly, not overnight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;T: Take action early – schedule evaluations before symptoms escalate. Preventive care saves lives long before emergency care tries to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The power of proactive prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Bhojraj, shifting focus from 'watching the wrong signs' to implementing the H.E.A.R.T. method moves patients from a state of being 'anxious, reactive, and confused to confident, informed, and proactive'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He concluded that the side effect of this proactive approach often extends beyond heart health, leading to an improvement in the patient's entire lifestyle: “And the side effect?&lt;/span&gt; They often end up improving not just their heart health, but their entire lifestyle. Caring for your heart isn’t as hard as it feels. Many people are simply watching the wrong signs. When you learn the ones that truly matter, prevention becomes your strongest tool.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

It often shows up quietly, behaving like “nothing serious,” and that’s exactly why so many people discover it late. The biggest problem? Myths. Assumptions and half-truths that make people brush off symptoms, skip screenings, or convince themselves everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want people to catch colon cancer early, when it’s most treatable, we have to bust these myths once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Hidden Signs of Colon Cancer You Could Be Ignoring That Might Save Your Life | Dr Deep Goel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 1: “Colon cancer only affects older people.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most stubborn myths out there. A lot of people still think colon cancer is something that happens in old age, and because of that, warning signs in younger adults get waved off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the reality looks very different now. Cases in people under 50 are rising every year, and it’s no longer shocking to see diagnoses in someone in their 20s, 30s, or 40s. It’s not “an old person’s disease” anymore, and ignoring symptoms because of age is a huge reason diagnoses get delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 2: “Rectal bleeding? Must be hemorrhoids.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one gets repeated so often it feels almost a fact. Yes, hemorrhoids are common, but that doesn’t mean bleeding should be dismissed without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer and hemorrhoids can look very similar in the early stages, and many patients later find out their “hemorrhoids” were actually something much more serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When bleeding is blamed on harmless causes again and again, people end up putting off colonoscopies, and by the time they get one, the disease is further along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 3: “If I feel fine and there’s no pain, there’s no cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This myth is exactly why colon cancer often goes unnoticed for years. A lot of people think cancer has to be dramatic, intense pain, major symptoms, something that feels obviously wrong. But colon cancer doesn’t start that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stages, it can be completely silent or cause tiny changes in your bowel habits, energy, or digestion that are easy to brush off. Waiting for something “big” to happen before paying attention gives cancer the time it needs to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling fine doesn’t automatically mean everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 4: “My stool test was normal” or “I had a clear colonoscopy years ago, so I’m safe.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A negative test is good news, but it’s not a lifelong guarantee. Polyps can develop over time, and stool tests don’t catch everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What usually happens is people get comfortable after a normal report and start ignoring new symptoms like bleeding, anemia, or sudden bowel changes. But new symptoms always deserve fresh attention, no matter how perfect your past reports were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body doesn’t run on a once-in-a-lifetime warranty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 5: “I live healthy and have no family history, so my risk is low.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy lifestyle definitely helps, but it doesn’t make anyone bulletproof. And while family history increases risk, many people diagnosed with colon cancer have no relatives with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This myth creates a false sense of security, “I eat clean, I exercise, so nothing can happen.” But colon cancer can still develop even in people who do everything “right.” That’s why everyone, not just high-risk individuals, needs routine screening when they hit the recommended age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health is helpful, not magical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 6: “Colonoscopy is scary, painful, risky, or too embarrassing.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the myth that keeps people from getting screened altogether. Most of the fear comes from old stories or exaggerated assumptions. In reality, colonoscopies are safe, usually painless (thanks to sedation), and incredibly effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this test special is that it doesn’t just find cancer, it actually helps prevent it. If doctors spot polyps, they can remove them right then and there, stopping them from turning into something dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer is highly preventable and very treatable when caught early. But myths, even the harmless-sounding ones, make people wait, assume, and ignore their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about symptoms without fear, asking questions, and showing up for screenings can literally save lives. Don’t let an old myth get in the way of getting the care you deserve. Your health is worth the check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 05:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新冠疫苗接种的风险有多大？ - East Anglia Bylines</title><link>https://eastangliabylines.co.uk/news/health/how-risky-is-the-covid-19-vaccination/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A team from the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products and the French National Health Insurance service has just &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2842305?fbclid=IwY2xjawOjxR9leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETF2OXQ3YVozc1NEV1ZZSTkzc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHg-wCztkiYwJP0KCWfS0dNOLRhYLsqqGq2jfrXqSkNkLt8BGpxRZDo_E8539_aem_uOd99PV2dIpJ3ODcCjR2EA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;published the findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;of a major study of mortality and the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine.

They were interested in whether vaccinated people were more likely, less likely, or just as likely to die over several years compared with unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who was in the study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used French national health records for people aged 18 to 59 who lived in France, had used health care in 2020, and were still alive on 1 November 2021. It included 22.8 million people who were given at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine (mainly Pfizer or Moderna) and 5.9 million who had not been vaccinated by that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How the comparison was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared how many people died over four years in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Because the two groups were different in age, health and social factors, the researchers used statistical methods to make the groups more similar before comparing deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Main results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the vaccinated group, 0.4% of people died during follow‑up, compared with 0.6% in the unvaccinated group. After adjustment, vaccinated people had about a one‑quarter lower chance of dying from any cause and about a three‑quarters lower chance of dying in hospital from severe COVID‑19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What happened over time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower risk of death in vaccinated people was strongest in the first year after vaccination but remained smaller and still present over the full four‑year period. The pattern was similar whether or not deaths from COVID‑19 were counted, and it was seen in men and women, younger and older adults in this age range, richer and poorer areas, and people with and without long‑term illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Causes of death&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, the main causes of death were cancer, accidents and suicides, and heart and blood vessel diseases. Vaccinated people had lower risks of death than unvaccinated people for most major causes, including cancer, heart disease and lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What this means, and limits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are properly cautious about their findings. Over this very large population, they are clear that mRNA COVID‑19 vaccines do not increase long‑term death risk in adults aged 18 to 59, and indeed are linked to a small but lasting drop in overall mortality. However, this was not a randomised trial, so they cannot be certain that vaccinated people were not healthier or had safer lifestyles in ways that are hard to measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, in any case, rumours of increased death risks from Covid vaccination are very clearly unfounded. When the next pandemic comes, it would be wise to trust the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-from-east-anglia-bylines"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://eastangliabylines.co.uk/"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;East Anglia Bylines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://bylines.scot/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Friends-of-cover-page.jpg" alt="Friends of Bylines Network" class="wp-image-63692 size-full"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-media-text__content"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Friends of Bylines Network&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has never been a greater need for grassroots journalism that investigates the stories that really matter, holds power to account and champions the voices of everyday citizens.

Likewise, many medications can raise your cholesterol levels, including those that treat acne, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a69190458/high-blood-pressure-causes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and others. None of these causes are directly affected by how much water you drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hydration likely supports cholesterol management, but it isn’t a cure,” says &lt;a href="http://www.healthbysapna.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sapna Peruvemba, M.S., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sapna Peruvemba, M.S., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and Ph.D. student in Nutritional Science at Loma Linda University. “Evidence suggests that inadequate water intake may increase cardiometabolic risk, and multiple studies show that drinking water can modestly lower blood lipids. But hydration should be viewed as a complementary strategy alongside established therapies like healthy diet, medications, and exercise, not a standalone treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does hydration impact heart health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While drinking water does not have a direct effect on your cholesterol levels, it does play a role in your overall heart health. “&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a65870951/signs-of-dehydration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dehydration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dehydration&lt;/a&gt; makes it harder for your heart to pump blood throughout your body,” explains &lt;a href="https://ladybugnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jamie Baham, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jamie Baham, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cancer prevention registered dietitian at Ladybug Nutrition. One study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/43/35/3335/6553797" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:European Heart Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;also found that maintaining optimal hydration, especially as you get older, may help slow declines in cardiac function and reduce your risk of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying well hydrated may also support your efforts to make the healthy decisions that work to lower cholesterol. “One way that water helps our bodies maintain healthy cholesterol levels is in aiding removal of waste and bile,” explains Baham. “When we consume foods that are higher in fiber, which lowers cholesterol, water is key in having a healthy bowel movement and removing cholesterol through the stool. Without water, you’ll be trying to pass a hard stool—which is &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a35415960/how-to-make-yourself-poop-fast/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:constipation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the more water you drink, the fewer sugary beverages you’re likely to have. According to a study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623086340" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Journal of Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, higher consumption of sugary drinks is associated with higher levels of triglycerides and LDL “bad” cholesterol. “Sugary drinks cause spikes in insulin, which signals the body to produce more cholesterol,” explains Peruvemba. She adds that drinking enough water can also help prevent confusing thirst for hunger, potentially reducing your intake of fatty, sugary, or &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a65664887/ultra-processed-foods-weight-loss-gut-health-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt; that can also contribute to high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drinking adequate water is definitely a support to lowering cholesterol, but it cannot be used as a single-handed treatment plan,” Baham says. Water won’t directly lower your cholesterol, but getting enough can make it easier to make decisions in the kitchen that will help get your numbers down, plus support your heart health overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 04:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOclVhWmw3STY4TlMyUlJVaDRtVXRlWVVFRnVOSTJJWEVNMGg5bW8wc180Yl9lSzZXTWptamhWa01SOGJKQlkwbnV3alJqQXFld0V3NGkxTnRnV2hLUENHamN1bkp3b0dDcjBVbXNrWDJPTE1MeDN3YkZEdHhiWThDc2lTOE1qcEFl</guid></item><item><title>新的癌症治疗为早期试验中的“不可治愈”白血病带来希望- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-cancer-therapy-offers-hope-for-incurable-leukaemia-in-early-trial</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A small group of patients with an otherwise incurable form of T‑cell leukaemia have seen their  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="185108" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; driven into remission by an innovative form of immune therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment uses &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/t-cells-31681"&gt;T-cells&lt;/a&gt; – a type of white blood cell – from a healthy donor, re-engineered in the lab to recognise and attack leukaemia cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike personalised cancer therapies made from each patient's own cells, these can be prepared in advance as an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00745-4"&gt;"off-the-shelf"&lt;/a&gt; product and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2304744"&gt;given quickly&lt;/a&gt; to people in urgent need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-immune-cell-discovery-wins-2025-nobel-prize-heres-the-science"&gt;Surprising Immune Cell Discovery Wins 2025 Nobel Prize. Here's The Science.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families facing a disease that has returned after every standard treatment, a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj38ymeyg4mo"&gt;ready-made therapy&lt;/a&gt; that can clear leukaemia to undetectable levels is a major step forward. The latest results of the first 11 patients, treated at Great Ormond Street and King's College Hospital, have just been published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2505478"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific trick here is particularly clever. In T‑cell leukaemia, the cancer itself is made of T-cells, so simply adding more T-cells from outside would normally cause friendly fire: the therapeutic cells would attack each other as well as the cancer or be rejected by the patient's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251208/Genome-edited-immune-cell-therapy-shows-promise-for-treating-aggressive-blood-cancer.asp"&gt;gene‑editing tools&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have switched off or altered key molecules on the donor T-cells so that they can slip past the patient's immune defences and &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/teen-beats-deadly-leukemia-with-life-saving-gene-edited-cell-therapy/"&gt;focus their attack&lt;/a&gt; on the leukaemia cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early studies, some patients with no remaining treatment options achieved deep remissions, where even sensitive tests could no longer detect leukaemia. This then opened the door to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="185108" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; or bone marrow transplant from a donor, which remains the only realistic route to a &lt;a href="https://bloodcancerunited.org/blood-cancer-care/adults/types-blood-cancer-treatment/stem-cell-transplantation/allogeneic"&gt;long‑term cure&lt;/a&gt; for these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;T-cells explained.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nuance lost in the media coverage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the non-expert, it is tempting to see &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj38ymeyg4mo"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; about "reversing incurable cancer" and assume this is a magic bullet that will soon replace chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The truth is both more modest and, in some ways, more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This treatment is not designed to be the first thing given to every person with leukaemia. It is a specialist option for the few whose cancer has resisted or returned after standard treatments. In that setting, where the alternative may be palliative care alone, having an extra step on the ladder – one more line of defence – can be life changing, even if it is not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another point often lost in media coverage is that this therapy is a bridge, not a destination. In the reported cases, the goal was to reduce the cancer burden enough to make a stem cell transplant feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineered T-cells are not expected to provide lifelong control by themselves. Instead, they act as a very powerful but temporary strike against the leukaemia, buying time for the patient to receive a transplant, which can then rebuild a healthy immune and blood‑forming system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That combined strategy – intensive but time‑limited immune therapy, followed by transplant – is what offers a realistic chance of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-025-02685-5"&gt;long‑term survival&lt;/a&gt; for some of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, life after such treatment is rarely straightforward. A stem cell or bone marrow transplant can save a life, but it is also one of the most &lt;a href="https://haematologica.org/article/view/haematol.2024.286063"&gt;demanding procedures&lt;/a&gt; in modern medicine. In the months afterwards, patients are at high risk of serious infections, because their new immune system is still immature and may also be suppressed by drugs used to prevent rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people experience profound fatigue, weight loss, and emotional distress. A significant number spend repeated spells in hospital coping with complications such as &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1609337"&gt;graft‑versus‑host disease&lt;/a&gt;, where the donor immune cells attack the patient's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38066845/"&gt;own tissues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even years later, survivors may live with chronic skin, gut, or liver problems, hormonal changes, fertility issues, or the &lt;a href="https://www.leukaemia.org.au/education/mental-health/"&gt;psychological impact&lt;/a&gt; of prolonged illness and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that perspective, it is important not to present this new T‑cell treatment as a simple one‑time cure, after which life instantly returns to normal. For some patients in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; "case series" (a report on a small set of patients), the therapy was part of a long, difficult journey that had already included multiple rounds of chemotherapy and hospital admissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding an experimental immune therapy and then a transplant increases both the chances of survival and the complexity of aftercare. After treatment, care isn't just about checking whether the leukaemia has returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients often need lifelong monitoring for late effects, vaccinations to retrain their new immune systems, and support with returning to work, study, and family life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A transformation hard to overstate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, for those people and their families, the gains are immense. To walk out of hospital after being told that nothing more could be done, and then later hear the words "no evidence of leukaemia", is a transformation that is hard to overstate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185140" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185140" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/child_with_leukemia_642.jpg" alt="child, parent, and doctor" class="wp-image-185140 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/child_with_leukemia_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/child_with_leukemia_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185140" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;To hear the words "no evidence of leukaemia" is a transformation that is hard to overstate.(&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEJePuiO8Y/"&gt;FatCamera/Getty Images Signature&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents describe seeing their children go back to school or play sport. Adults talk about being able to plan a holiday or think about the future again. These very human milestones embody the promise of the science far more clearly than any technical description of gene editing or immune receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet they rest on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3312307/"&gt;decades&lt;/a&gt; of painstaking lab work, safety testing, and thoughtful choices by doctors, and on patients and families willing to take part in experimental treatments when the outcome is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a wider significance beyond this particular leukaemia. If donor‑derived, gene‑edited T-cells can be made safe and effective for one rare and aggressive cancer, the same concept might be adapted for other blood cancers or even some solid tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634025001047"&gt;off‑the‑shelf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10814647/"&gt;cell therapy&lt;/a&gt; that can be stored, shipped, and given in many hospitals could be far more accessible than bespoke therapies that rely on each patient's own cells, which are complex and slow to manufacture. That said, scaling up production, ensuring the cells are available equitably, and managing the costs will be major challenges for health systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, where does that leave the public trying to interpret dramatic headlines? It helps to hold two ideas in mind at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, this is an extraordinary scientific and clinical achievement for a group of patients who had very few options left, offering real hope where previously there was almost none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it is not a universal cure, and it comes at the price of intense treatment and long‑term follow‑up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most honest way to describe it is as an extra lifeline for some people in very specific circumstances – a powerful new tool added to an existing toolbox, not the end of cancer as we know it. That may sound less dramatic than "reversing the incurable", but for the families involved, it can mean everything.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271643/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The 4-7-8 method is a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/active-meditation-breathwork"&gt;breathwork practice&lt;/a&gt; rooted in the ancient yogic tradition of pranayama (or breath regulation), which helps relax the body and mind and subsequently eases you into sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, a bit of reckoning: “Research has shown us that sleep is not an optional activity,” says David F. Dinges, PhD, in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6281147/" target="_blank"&gt;his study&lt;/a&gt; that lists the physical and mental effects of a bad night's sleep. Truly, it hurts your entire body, impairing cognition and shortening your ability to focus. Oh, it also puts you in a bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man behind the 4-7-8 method, Dr. Andrew Weil, the founder and director of the University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, has dubbed it a “natural tranquilizer for the nervous system.” It works by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our rest and digest mode, while switching off the sympathetic nervous system, which triggers our stress response (or fight or flight mode).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only can this kind of deep and rhythmic breathing help you get to sleep quickly, but it also reduces anxiety, can help us manage everything from &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-stop-sugar-cravings" target="_blank"&gt;cravings&lt;/a&gt; to anger, and helps with the normal functioning of processes like digestion in the body. Given so many of us are chronically stressed, it pays to incorporate techniques like this into your day-to-day routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can do the 4-7-8 to help you get to sleep, in the middle of the night when you wake up, or at any point during the day when you want to feel calmer. However and whenever you do it, Dr Weil advises performing the technique regularly and consistently–ideally, twice a day–to see long-lasting and life-changing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how to do it? The ultra-simple breathing exercise goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Breathe in through your nose for a count of four seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Hold your breath for seven seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Exhale for eight seconds, making a “whoosh” sound through pursed lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Repeat up to four times, twice per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a beauty or wellness trend you're curious about? We want to know!

Photo: Alissa Eckert / CDC / Public Domain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The Center Square) – Arizona continues to see measles cases along the Utah border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 176 total cases for 2025. Of those, 172 are associated with the outbreak on the Arizona-Utah border, specifically in Mohave County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the last two weeks, we have seen an increase of 22 cases,” said Shane Brady, deputy state epidemiologist with the Arizona Department of Health Services. “We are at six hospitalizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-six percent of cases involve people under age 18. A majority of those people - 97% - are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your family from measles,” Brady told The Center Square Wednesday. “One dose is about 93% effective, and two doses provides 97% protection, so it is really important to make sure that everyone stays up to date on all their vaccines, including measles, as it is the best way to protect yourself from disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a contagious virus that officials &lt;a href="https://swuhealth.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Update_-measles-in-Southwest-Utah.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; can remain airborne up to two hours after an infected person has exited a room. Symptoms are known to start seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navajo County is the only other county in Arizona where measles cases have been &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this year. Coconino and Apache County do not have any cases, and like Navajo and Mohave County, they are also on the border with Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked why other Arizona counties do not have cases, Brady said that could be due to a number of factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do know that vaccination rates we’re talking about are childhood vaccinations,” said Brady. “For school data in terms of the 2024-2025 school year, 88.7% of kindergarteners were fully vaccinated for measles, and in Mohave County, that’s 78.4%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady added that the statewide average is lower than the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks, leading Brady to state that Arizona is “very fortunate that we have not spread outside of Mohave County” for this outbreak. That, said Brady, is why Arizona is encouraging people to make sure that they are vaccinated to prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people who get vaccinated will have a breakthrough infection,” said Brady. “Typically, breakthrough infections are less severe. That is not necessarily always the case, but we know that a vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and prevent the disease in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a November story for The Center Square, Nicole Witt, Arizona’s assistant director for public health preparedness, &lt;a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/arizona/article_2c90ca8c-59b2-401d-82a1-db3063f27f99.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the current outbreak is the largest Arizona has seen since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 01:32:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQTm1QMmlYWXY0WjZiYmhHUnFoQ0w2QWE5UHdwRE55c09Wb1AwRnFLbUlySlpueFVXaUxFbXJPUEdwWVU3VDJ5OHFUZTAweW5kdlR1aVFCSjZMdjhRTEdhSU1HWVgyUWlZRS1rNnpramdBeGxSeURPbExMS3FERG4taA</guid></item><item><title>俄勒冈州在疫苗接种率下降的情况下创下百日咳病例记录- OregonLive.com</title><link>https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/12/oregon-sets-record-for-whooping-cough-cases-amid-declining-vaccination-rates.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QZZU4EMFZ5GBJEXF3KOD2ECJUQ"&gt;Oregon has &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2024/11/oregon-whooping-cough-cases-trend-toward-record-prompting-calls-for-vaccinations.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2024/11/oregon-whooping-cough-cases-trend-toward-record-prompting-calls-for-vaccinations.html"&gt;reported more cases of whooping cough&lt;/a&gt; this year than at any time in state history, and health officials say falling vaccination rates — especially among pregnant people — are adding to the danger for infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WK3A47GPOVEDZD3NED4Z4G2OME"&gt;As of Tuesday, the &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/PregnancyImmunizationData/Welcome?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/PregnancyImmunizationData/Welcome?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;Oregon Health Authority&lt;/a&gt; has logged 1,475 cases of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough.

While people of all ages can become sick, infants have much smaller air passages and are far more likely to suffer severe illness, land in the hospital or die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="G2SPPYGOEVAUBIYPKX26J3TCFQ"&gt;So far this year, &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/PregnancyImmunizationData/Welcome?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/PregnancyImmunizationData/Welcome?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;Oregon has recorded&lt;/a&gt; 87 cases in infants younger than 12 months.

To help protect babies, medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that pregnant people get the whooping cough vaccine known as Tdap — which also helps prevent tetanus and diphtheria — between weeks 27 and 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E4VD4L7QXBC37O4JDGKTAS5J6U"&gt;“One of the most important things someone can do to protect their newborn is to get the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy,” Dr. Howard Chiou, medical director for communicable disease and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ROHXY4GLEFDBTFXA5JHVZZQINA"&gt;​​Despite that guidance, Chiou said fewer pregnant people in Oregon receive the recommended vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W22THNLJTVBZVHSLVNVB6HJUNI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/PregnancyImmunizationData/Welcome?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;New state data&lt;/a&gt; shows only 69% of pregnant people in Oregon received a Tdap shot last year — down from 72% in 2020. Vaccination rates in 2024 varied widely by county, ranging from as low as 17% to as high as 82%, with the lowest rates largely concentrated in rural areas.

Health officials said the return to pre-pandemic social behavior and lower vaccination rates, has created ideal conditions for the disease to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GYTM35UWKFDVPJLYXPFOVBQ7B4"&gt;Part of the challenge, doctors said, is that pertussis can be difficult to diagnose.

Because there is often a long latency period between exposure and symptom onset, diagnoses are frequently delayed, according to DPH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the disease progresses, it can result in serious complications, including lung cancer, tuberculosis and even death, the department added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Officials added that "most cases of silicosis are work-related – it is very rare for silicosis to occur outside of workplace exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cdc-reports-19th-cruise-ship-norovirus-outbreak-year-affecting-passengers-crew" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cdc Reports 19Th Cruise Ship Norovirus Outbreak This Year Affecting Passengers And Crew;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cdc Reports 19Th Cruise Ship Norovirus Outbreak This Year Affecting Passengers And Crew&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A father and son set up a quartz countertop at a booth in Albany Sept. 15, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Officials said the risk exists when handling natural stones, such as granite, but is especially high when working with engineered stone, such as quartz. While natural granite typically contains less than 45% silica, engineered stone can contain more than 90%, DPH reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"In recent years, the disease has become more prevalent among stone fabrication workers due to the rise in popularity of countertops made from engineered stone (also known as quartz or artificial stone)," DPH reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/botulism-deaths-raise-food-truck-safety-concerns-doctor-preaches-awareness" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Botulism Deaths Raise Food Truck Safety Concerns As Doctor Preaches 'Awareness';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Botulism Deaths Raise Food Truck Safety Concerns As Doctor Preaches 'Awareness'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An employee applies a sealant to sheets for countertops May 14, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The department noted that, while this is the first confirmed case in Massachusetts within this industry, more cases are expected due to the disease's long latency period and the rising popularity of engineered stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other states have also reported cases of silicosis. In a 2023 study, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:California researchers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;California researchers&lt;/a&gt; identified 52 quartz countertop workers with silicosis.

By contrast, all work involving engineered stone has already been banned in Australia due to the severe risks it poses to workers. Other countries are also pushing for more regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The DPH emphasizes that silicosis is "absolutely preventable" through proper workplace controls. The alert urges employers in the stone countertop fabrication industry to implement effective safety measures, such as wet cutting and proper ventilation, to minimize silica exposure and protect workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Silicosis is a devastating, life-altering disease and one that is also absolutely preventable," Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/massachusetts-man-dies-deadly-lung-disease-linked-popular-kitchen-countertops" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Massachusetts man dies from deadly lung disease linked to popular kitchen countertops;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Massachusetts man dies from deadly lung disease linked to popular kitchen countertops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 00:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQdTV0V2Z0YTNuNzJjdTRPSmZMWmpSdnUxMW4yYjY3amoxb1lYUFkxM0wtc0s5bF9hRUMxVUlacFlwVmpMeWZVRnNVXzhNTHNKcXBUZHpZNmdUTHVqeHRac2xUZzhQQjlCM3RrdzZEdXJCc3ZSTEtZOWpnLTdNLVUxSWNhdjhiNGZFdDlVTllB</guid></item><item><title>在俄亥俄州学校校园发现约70只死秃鹫- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/dead-vultures-ohio-school-bird-flu/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-0" data-index="0" data-path="/pittsburgh/news/dead-vultures-ohio-school-bird-flu/" class="content content-article lazyload"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After about 70 dead vultures were found at a school in Ohio, officials say preliminary results show they had bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Clermont County Public Health, the bodies of dozens of black vultures were found on the campus of St. Bernadette School in Pierce Township. Photos showed the birds all over the ground near baseball fields and a pavilion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two birds were taken to a state laboratory for testing, and the health department said preliminary results indicate the birds died from highly pathogenic avian influenza, known as bird flu. Samples have been sent to a national lab for further confirmation, officials said. Those results are expected to take 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clermont County Public Health said the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, has been found in wild and domestic bird populations since 2022 throughout the country, including Ohio. Transmission can increase in the spring and fall with bird migration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can get bird flu, but the health department said it's very rare in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a general precaution, people should observe wildlife from a distance and avoid contact with sick or dead animals. Likewise, bird owners or people who have backyard flocks should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds," Clermont County Public Health said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/piercetownshipohio/posts/pfbid02B9EHhtj2qvKqQD47KEkvnxWB3zK8MwVWEzVW882tMQJUgR7iAbDzZ2EW3P6KWncNl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;, Pierce Township, Ohio, said the risk to residents is low, but anyone who finds dead birds near their home is asked to keep their distance and call the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. &lt;/p&gt;

In Denmark alone, 99 children were fathered by the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At least 197 children were born thanks to the sperm of an anonymous Danish donor using the alias Kjeld before the sperm bank discovered a serious genetic abnormality," public broadcaster DR &lt;a href="https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/salg-af-saed-med-uopdaget-kraeftrisiko-har-foert-til-mindst-197-donorboern"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-oldest-baby-may-not-be-a-record-for-long-says-expert"&gt;'World's Oldest Baby' May Not Be a Record For Long, Says Expert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to DR, Denmark's European Sperm Bank, one of the largest in the world, was alerted in April 2020 that a child conceived via donation and diagnosed with cancer carried a genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It then tested a sample of the donor's sperm, but the screening did not detect the rare &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/tp53/"&gt;TP53 mutation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185106" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/lab_test_sperm_642.jpg" alt="lab testing on a sperm sample" class="wp-image-185106 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/lab_test_sperm_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/lab_test_sperm_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185106" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Tests were conducted on the donated sperm after reports surfaced of a child conceived with donation being diagnosed with cancer.

He figured it was because he was holding a kitten, according to the report, which does not identify the man or where he resided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He fought off the skunk, rendering it unconscious, and walked away with a scratch on his shin that bled. But he didn’t think he’d been bitten, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, the man started experiencing hallucinations. He also had a stiff neck, confusion and difficulty swallowing and walking. Two days after his symptoms appeared, he was found unresponsive at home. He was resuscitated and taken to a hospital, but he never regained consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five days in a hospital, he was declared brain dead and removed from life support. His left kidney, heart, lungs and both corneas were recovered for donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His kidney went to a man from Michigan, who received the transplant at a hospital in Ohio. Five weeks later, the man started experiencing tremors, confusion, urinary incontinence and weakness in his legs. He was hospitalized with fever, difficulty swallowing and an extreme fear of water. Clinicians suspected he had rabies, and several samples were sent to the CDC for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a week at the hospital, the Michigan man died. Local public health officials interviewed his family, who reported that he had not been exposed at any animals. But the testing showed evidence of rabies in his saliva, skin and brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when the CDC, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and an Idaho public health district began investigating the donor as the source. Health officials tested the Idaho man’s right kidney, which had not been donated, and detected a rabies variant linked to silver-haired bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, three other patients, one each from Idaho, California and New Mexico, received ocular grafts prepared from the Idaho man’s recovered corneas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As officials investigated the donor’s rabies status, the cornea recipients had their grafts removed as a precaution and received post-exposure prophylaxis, a medication taken after potential exposure to rabies to prevent infection. Rabies is almost always fatal without that medication, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;                        &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_1140/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_960/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_768/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_640/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_480/Rabies%202.JPG" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/public/latest-news/eo0jpa/picture312041788/alternates/FREE_1140/Rabies%202.JPG" alt="Rabies vaccines." title="Rabies 2.JPG" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                                        &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            Rabies vaccines.

He figured it was because he was holding a kitten, according to the report, which does not identify the man or where he resided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He fought off the skunk, rendering it unconscious, and walked away with a scratch on his shin that bled. But he didn’t think he’d been bitten, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, the man started experiencing hallucinations. He also had a stiff neck, confusion and difficulty swallowing and walking. Two days after his symptoms appeared, he was found unresponsive at home. He was resuscitated and taken to a hospital, but he never regained consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five days in a hospital, he was declared brain dead and removed from life support. His left kidney, heart, lungs and both corneas were recovered for donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His kidney went to a man from Michigan, who received the transplant at a hospital in Ohio. Five weeks later, the man started experiencing tremors, confusion, urinary incontinence and weakness in his legs. He was hospitalized with fever, difficulty swallowing and an extreme fear of water. Clinicians suspected he had rabies, and several samples were sent to the CDC for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a week at the hospital, the Michigan man died. Local public health officials interviewed his family, who reported that he had not been exposed at any animals. But the testing showed evidence of rabies in his saliva, skin and brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when the CDC, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and an Idaho public health district began investigating the donor as the source.

Getting better from the flu will take longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The following day, Paige is in a side room on the acute assessment unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I do struggle a lot in winter," she says. "I was maybe in here two or three weeks ago.

On one of the days we were here, 932 patients came through the door. That number is expected to rise in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Attendance levels are already around 8% higher this year than last year. And the unit faces a daily shortage of between 50 to 70 beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the Royal Infirmary around 64 beds are currently taken up by people with respiratory viruses, including flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;We meet one patient who waited 106 hours for a bed on a ward. Another, Gary, came in with a stomach bug and finally got a bed after 34 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Oscar came into the hospital wheezing and finding it hard to breathe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By late afternoon, the children's waiting area is full. Parents stand rocking crying babies as every seat is taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Respiratory cases of flu and bronchiolitis, a condition affecting the lungs of young patients, are rising fast here too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In just 30 minutes, 30 children arrive at the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At five months old this is Oscar's first winter and his first trip to A&amp;amp;E. His mum brought him in because he was wheezing and struggling to breathe. A few hours after arriving, he is finally seen by a doctor and told he has bronchiolitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"These bugs are everywhere at the moment - Oscar's older brother brought it home from school and now Oscar has it," says his mum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Richard Mitchell has been the chief executive of University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust since 2021 - and has witnessed first-hand how it gets harder to cope with each winter that passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We are already seeing very high levels of flu," he tells us. He expects numbers to climb into January. "That is one of the many things I am concerned about at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"At this point I feel we are working at the limits of our ability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Turning minor cases away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The hospital has introduced a new system to manage the flow of patients arriving at its emergency department, as pressure grows on front-line services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Receptionists, nurses, all the way up to consultants, now sit in a bank of desks at the entrance, assessing patients as they arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This speeds up triage, moving people away from the front door and ensuring those in greatest need receive urgent care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Staff say the range of cases has become increasingly polarised. Some of the most seriously ill patients are being driven in by relatives because of long waits for ambulances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Flu has started early this year&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the other end of the scale, people turn up with minor complaints after struggling to secure GP appointments. "Last week someone came in with a coldsore," one nurse tells us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Experienced staff can redirect those who do not need urgent care, helping them to book GP appointments or pointing them towards pharmacies and other services. Now one in 10 patients are sent away, although staff admit it can lead to frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Security has been tightened following one violent incident, with glass screens installed and 24‑hour guards now in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Leicester Royal Infirmary has introduced new measures each year to boost capacity and manage rising demand. Winter pressures continue to grow, while the quieter summer months have become a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To reduce ambulance queues, prefabricated structures were converted into a permanent unit with 14 beds - all are full during the BBC's visit. Without them that would have been 14 ambulances queueing for hours to unload their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Unlike many hospitals, Leicester's emergency unit is not totally overwhelmed by elderly patients. Frail patients are streamed directly to specialist areas, including a frailty unit, or supported in the community to avoid long hospital stays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Preston Lodge, a former care home bought by the trust, now provides 25 beds, with 14 more opening on December 15. Patients who no longer need acute care - but still require rehabilitation or support - are moved there while awaiting care packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We aim to get people better ready for going home and hopefully keep them stronger and more independent so they aren't back in hospital so frequently over the winter," says head of nursing, Emma Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Looking ahead, Mr Mitchell expects waits and delays to only get worse for patients in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For the first week in January - traditionally the busiest each year - the hospital plans to free up more emergency beds, but that means delaying other operations and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He says: "We will not be able to provide timely care to every patient this winter but we will continue to do our utmost to ensure that patients are treated with dignity and respect to ensure they receive safe care and we will do everything possible to manage those waiting times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Hospital leaders here are trying to take proactive steps - rather than simply reacting to each crisis. But staff and patients alike warn that hospitals across the country are caught in the middle of a system, many believe, is close to breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said it was "under no illusions this is going to be a tough winter for our NHS".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A spokesman said: "Flu cases are rising, so it is vital that patients can get protected. Almost 17 million vaccines have been delivered this autumn - 350,000 more compared to this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There is no national shortage of the flu vaccine and we would urge everyone eligible to get their vaccination to protect themselves and their loved ones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9hMWNnLU9RVEd2cTM4djBDMnpMNEFyNUVFWlpWSTBiV05vWHZpejV6OERpMGlNc2xpVW5fXy1lZUc5bWhjaFBTb3RPY0VjSV9aLXk2YVQ2MU8zUdIBX0FVX3lxTE9DX2RBcmo5cGVURGRrR2pvWlpncWxEUjc1Nmk5U3U5Tkg2V1ZEXzduNm81X0QxU01YQmoyM3lDaVl1RGVZTEJVRG41M2gxd3l5blJSQWR0eHRKVWtQQ2VZ</guid></item><item><title>来自新病毒株的“冬季呕吐疾病”的早期激增袭击了加利福尼亚州-旧金山纪事报</title><link>https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/norovirus-surge-california-strain-21235363.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

The experts said the therapy, known informally as TRT, has been underutilized due to outdated concerns about risks of prostate cancer, stroke and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/no-heart-risks-testosterone-replacement-therapy-study-finds-rcna89229" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa563f" class="body-graf"&gt;“Testosterone is still regulated as if it were a dangerous, performance-enhancing drug from the athletic doping scandals of the 1980s. And because of this outdated classification, many physicians fear prescribing it or even screening for it,” said Dr. Helen Bernie, an associate professor of urology at the Indiana University School of Medicine, who was one of the panelists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-670c9a" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel was part of a series that the FDA rolled out earlier this year. In each, the agency convenes medical experts for roundtable discussions that can give clues about regulatory changes the FDA might pursue. Three months after a similar panel on hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women, for example, the FDA announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/hormone-replacement-therapy-no-warning-label-fda-rcna243008" target="_blank"&gt;removing a black box warning from the medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-132537" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, several panelists suggested that the FDA should expand its approval of TRT drugs to include men with low testosterone levels and any related symptoms, in accordance with guidelines from the American Urological Association. So far, the FDA has only approved forms of TRT — including gels, pills, patches and injections — for men who have both low testosterone and an associated medical condition, such as a genetic disorder that prevents the testicles from producing the hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b26ced" class="body-graf"&gt;“Given the label restriction, one can make the argument that thousands of patients in need of testosterone therapy have been and are being deprived of it,” said Dr. John Mulhall, a panelist and urologic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18b9d1" class="body-graf"&gt;Testosterone therapy has soared in popularity in the last five or so years — in large part among young men who have turned to it for unapproved uses such as increasing muscle mass. The medication is widely promoted on social media for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03d78b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not that there is an increase in the prevalence of testosterone deficiency,” said Dr. Bobby Najari, a urologist at NYU Langone Health, who was not part of Wednesday’s discussion. “I think it’s an increase in the demand for a drug that can make it easier to have physiques that we see in superhero movies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6792a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Some wellness clinics and “longevity centers” also offer TRT as a purported way to slow the effects of aging, though the FDA has not approved it for that purpose. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-cautions-about-using-testosterone-products-low-testosterone-due" target="_blank"&gt;cautioned in February&lt;/a&gt; that the safety and benefits of this use have not been established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5092e3" class="body-graf"&gt;Now-Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfl6ClEz5oo" target="_blank"&gt;told Newsmax in 2023&lt;/a&gt; that he was taking testosterone replacement at the time as part of an “anti-aging protocol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-310c45" class="body-graf"&gt;Typically, men’s testosterone levels decline about 1% per year starting in their 30s or 40s. Levels aren’t considered low until they reach a certain threshold. After that point, some men experience short-term symptoms such as fatigue, low sex drive and erectile dysfunction, as well as long-term ones like osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a0702" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel included little discussion of the drawbacks of TRT, such as an elevated risk of blood clots. TRT can also shut down sperm production, so doctors don’t recommend it to men trying to have children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-362c3b" class="body-graf"&gt;“If they take it long enough, and they’re rendered infertile, it may not be reversible,” said Dr. Marc Goldstein, surgeon-in-chief of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Weill Cornell Medicine, who wasn’t on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2058d" class="body-graf"&gt;Not all cases of low testosterone need to be treated with TRT, he added — some can be addressed through weight loss or an outpatient surgery to remove swollen veins in the scrotum called varicoceles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d05ce7" class="body-graf"&gt;Najari, meanwhile, said it’s important to manage expectations about how much TRT can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-99f255" class="body-graf"&gt;“A small group of men don’t feel any change at all,” he said. “On the other end of that curve, a small group of men say, ‘I feel so much better. This really changed my life.’ And then the majority of men say, ‘I feel a little bit better.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc6a61" class="body-graf"&gt;The panelists on Wednesday argued that the Drug Enforcement Administration should remove its designation of testosterone as a Schedule 3 drug — the same category that the drug ketamine is in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db1e49" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Landon Trost, a panelist and the director of the Male Fertility and Peyronie’s Clinic in Orem, Utah, said that because prescriptions for Schedule 3 drugs must be carefully tracked, physicians may be hesitant to give them and some pharmacies may choose not to carry the drugs or limit their volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcdf3b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Because of that, you get these pop-up T clinics and other things that will fill that gap, whereas normally the patient would be going to their primary care physician, their urologist, their endocrinologist,” Trost said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8af8cf" class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA says the broader goal of these panels is to “modernize regulatory oversight,” but some public health experts have &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fda-kennedy-antidepressants-hormones-meetings-experts-afbd525b29ca5e2585b79548a075be75" target="_blank"&gt;criticized them&lt;/a&gt; for not incorporating a diversity of viewpoints or thoroughly screening panelists for conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-92cfde" class="body-graf"&gt;Some experts have also expressed concern that the format may be taking the place of a more formal review process and that panelists are picked to support changes that Kennedy favors. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, said that a panel on antidepressant use during pregnancy was “alarmingly unbalanced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e89d3" class="body-graf"&gt;FDA Commissioner Marty Makary pushed back against that line of criticism on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcf37f" class="body-graf"&gt;“The FDA today is making it clear that we want to learn more about this topic. We don’t have preconceived ideas. We are not promoting any medical recommendation or any product,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-42dd38" class="body-graf"&gt;Several panelists noted that doctors’ understanding of testosterone therapy has changed over the last several decades. Although the FDA had previously identified reports of strokes and heart attacks in patients taking the hormone, a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2215025" target="_blank"&gt;large clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; launched in 2018 did not find those risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ebabe3" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;In light of the trial results, the FDA in February recommended &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-issues-class-wide-labeling-changes-testosterone-products" target="_blank"&gt;removing a warning&lt;/a&gt; about an increased risk of cardiovascular issues from testosterone products. However, the agency said the products must add a warning about increased blood pressure based on the results of other safety studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 23:17:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNVU1IQVFtbEFEenU0NHdGZ3ZWbUVERHAtdTJTMldMTDJlbjNtWlFrY1doZ281eVp1REFxVW1sY2dwWnRaTjdYNGFIZDBEZHhRc1NwQjhXc1pybzB6NktJQlluNGdaNTRGX1dJZjJUWFhtMkdIaS1pZUF4LVY0NEw1cElrOHBsYjQ5N1hpNk5TbFZ2SmpvblJWVXVHdGnSAVZBVV95cUxNRXE5NlRLemk0UUNDYlk4RFRUMk82aDluaXZFZGxSYjJ6S2pjaDhjUHhqNXBnQUoxSkhFVUw5alBTSnpGSWIxdU9adkphUkNvMUpxdTJqUQ</guid></item><item><title>季节性流感-全球形势-世界卫生组织（ WHO ）</title><link>https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON586</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="don-content"&gt;
            Seasonal influenza (‘the flu’) is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses that circulate globally and year-round. It can cause illness ranging from mild to severe, sometimes resulting in hospitalization or death.  Seasonal influenza activity has increased globally in recent months, with an increased proportion of seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses being detected. This rise coincides with the onset of winter in the northern hemisphere and an increase in acute respiratory infections caused by influenza and other respiratory viruses typically observed at this time of year. Although global activity remains within expected seasonal ranges, early increases and higher activity than typical at this time of year have been observed in some regions.
Seasonal influenza viruses, including A(H3N2) viruses, continually evolve over time. Since August 2025, there has been a rapid increase of A(H3N2) J.2.4.1 alias K subclade viruses detected from several countries based on available genetic sequence data. These subclade K viruses have several changes from related A(H3N2) viruses. Current epidemiological data do not indicate an increase in disease severity, although this subclade marks a notable evolution in influenza A(H3N2) viruses.
Early estimates suggest that the influenza vaccine continues to provide protection against hospital attendance in both children and adults, even though its effectiveness against clinical disease during the current season remains uncertain. Vaccines remain essential, especially for people at high risk of influenza complications and their care givers. Even if there are some genetic differences between the circulating influenza viruses and the strains included in the vaccines, the seasonal influenza vaccine may still provide protection against drifted viruses and the other virus strains included in the vaccine. Vaccination is still expected to protect against severe illness and remains one of the most effective public health measures. 
WHO continues to monitor global influenza activity and influenza viruses, supports countries in surveillance capacity and updates guidance as needed. 
        &lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Globally, influenza activity has increased since October 2025 with influenza A viruses predominant among the viruses detected globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many northern hemisphere countries, acute respiratory infection levels increase at this time of year. These increases are typically caused by seasonal epidemics of respiratory pathogens such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other common respiratory viruses. The exact timing of the onset, the duration, magnitude and the severity of each epidemic might vary by location, influenced by multiple factors such as type of circulating viruses (including influenza and other respiratory pathogens), relative population immunity and environmental conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the northern hemisphere, some countries have reported early starts to the influenza season. In other countries, influenza activity is starting to increase, but has not yet reached the epidemic threshold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the southern hemisphere, some countries have had unusually long seasons compared to previous years, with virus activity remaining higher than usual in recent months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global influenza surveillance and monitoring is conducted through the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of over 160 institutions in 131 Member States. GISRS is tasked with conducting year-round surveillance and monitoring of influenza viruses and serving as the global alert mechanism for the emergence of novel influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens with pandemic potential.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the northern hemisphere temperate and sub-tropical countries, areas and territories, influenza activity was generally low from June to August 2025. Activity gradually increased in September and continued to increase through November 2025. Influenza A viruses, especially A(H3N2) viruses, predominated during this period (Fig. 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the southern hemisphere temperate and sub-tropical countries, areas and territories, influenza activity generally decreased from June 2025 and remained low through August. However, a slight increase has been observed since September. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated in June and July; however, A(H3N2) viruses have predominated since September (Fig. 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tropical areas, there has been sustained influenza activity from June through November. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated through July. Since then, the proportion of influenza A(H3N2) viruses among reported detections has increased and has become predominant since the end of September (Fig. 3).&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1.

A(H3N2) subclade K viruses have genetically drifted from related J.2.4 viruses and have several amino acid changes in their HA in comparison. Detections of subclade K viruses are increasing in many parts of the world, with the exception, to date, of South America. Subclade K viruses were particularly evident from August 2025 in Australia and New Zealand and have now been detected in more than 34 countries over the last 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influenza A(H3N2) percent positivity reported for epidemiological week 48 (24 to 30 November) 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-image-responsive="true" src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/products/disease-outbreak-news/flunet_influenza-a(h3n2).png?sfvrsn=464463f3_3" title="FluNet_Influenza A(H3N2)" alt="FluNet_Influenza A(H3N2)" sf-size="133607"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: GISRS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/surveillance-and-monitoring/influenza-surveillance-outputs"&gt;https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/surveillance-and-monitoring/influenza-surveillance-outputs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview of seasonal influenza by WHO Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;African region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenza detections in the WHO African Region overall increased in October with influenza A(H3N2) predominant. The timing and predominant virus varied by zone. In the western part of the region, influenza detections increased in September and October with A(H3N2) predominant since October. All seasonal subtypes have been detected continuously in the middle and eastern parts of the region. Influenza activity peaked in May 2025 in South Africa with almost exclusively A(H3N2) detections; in recent weeks influenza activity has increased slightly but remained low.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eastern Mediterranean Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While influenza activity in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region overall increased in October with A(H3N2) viruses predominant, there were variations by zone. In countries in the northern part of the region, influenza detections increased in October with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominant and lesser proportions of influenza A(H3N2) and B virus detections reported. In the Arabian Peninsula, influenza detections also increased in October but with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominant.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 21 November 2025, reported rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) in primary care were at baseline levels for most countries and areas of the WHO European Region. However, detections were increasing and regionally pooled test percent positivity in primary care sentinel surveillance rose above 10% in weeks 45 and 46 (ending on 15 November), marking the start of the 2025/26 influenza season for the European Region. This was approximately four weeks earlier than the median, but not out of the ordinary, with epidemiological trends similar to those observed in the 2022/23 influenza season.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenza activity was variable between countries, with those in the west of the Region generally seeing earlier increases of influenza indicators compared to others. Influenza admissions, detections, and percent positivity in hospital surveillance were also increasing from inter-seasonal levels, with a higher proportion aged 65 years or older. A majority of influenza detections from sentinel and non-sentinel primary care and hospital surveillance systems were A(H3N2) viruses.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Region of the Americas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 2025 southern hemisphere season in the Americas, influenza transmission exceeded the seasonal threshold in mid-March, remaining mostly at low to moderate levels. Circulation was driven by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, reaching a peak positivity of 19%. Activity then declined to low levels until the end of August, when an increase in circulation was observed, associated with influenza A(H3N2) in Brazil and Chile. As of beginning of November, Chile remains at moderate levels of influenza A(H3N2) transmission, without evidence of increased severity or rises in outpatient consultations. As of 4 November 2025, subclade K had not been detected in South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the northern hemisphere countries of the Americas, during week 45 of 2025, seasonal influenza circulation remained low, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating in the Caribbean and Central America. In North America, influenza activity—although still low—was increasing, mainly driven by influenza A virus detections. While most detections in Mexico were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, a predominance of influenza A(H3N2) has been observed in the United States and Canada, with growing detections of the A(H3N2) subclade K.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South-East Asia Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenza detections in the South-East Asia Region started increasing from June,  peaked in August and since then  have generally remained low with some exceptions. During the 2025 till November, the proportion of Influenza A among all influenza viruses tested positive was 66% Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant sub-type (43%) in transmission followed by A(H1N1)pdm09 (~20%). In Thailand, influenza detections of predominantly A(H3N2) increased in October and November. Influenza A(H3N2) detections also increased since July in Bangladesh and October in Sri Lanka. While the region has seen an increase in Influenza A(H3N2), 22 sequences of   subclade K have   been reported in GISAID from Nepal (1), India (4) and Thailand (17) as of 30 November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Western Pacific Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of October 2025, influenza seasonal activity has increased in the Western Pacific Region. In some countries, including Japan and the Republic of Korea, the onset of the typical seasonal influenza activity period started earlier than in previous years. As of 9 November 2025, influenza positivity ranged from 8% to 56% in the northern hemisphere countries. In southern hemisphere countries, influenza activity shows mixed trends; positivity has declined in Australia, remains high in New Zealand and is rapidly increasing in Fiji. The elevated influenza activity in New Zealand and Fiji is unusual for this time of the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The predominant circulating influenza subtype is influenza A(H3N2), marking a shift from A(H1N1)pdm09, which predominated during the 2024-2025 northern hemisphere winter season. The increases in influenza have predominantly been driven by the expansion of A(H3N2) subclade K, which represents 89% of sequences submitted to GISAID from the Western Pacific Region (as of 21 November 2025). &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seasonal influenza (the flu) is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses that circulate globally and year-round. In temperate regions, seasonal influenza typically peaks during the winter months, whereas in tropical areas, influenza viruses can circulate year-round with seasonality and intensity that varies across countries.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are four types of influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B viruses circulate and cause seasonal epidemics of disease:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes according to the combinations of the proteins on the surface of the virus. Currently circulating in humans are subtype A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza viruses. Influenza B viruses are not classified into subtypes but can be broken down into lineages. Influenza type B viruses belong to either B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Influenza spreads easily between people when they cough or sneeze. Influenza disease can cause illness ranging from mild to severe, sometimes resulting in hospitalization or death. While most individuals recover within a week without need for medical care, influenza can lead to serious complication including death, especially among high-risk groups such as young children, the elderly, pregnant women and those with underlying conditions. Health and care workers are at high risk of acquiring influenza virus infection due to increased exposure to the patients, and of further spreading particularly to vulnerable individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveillance &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of year-round global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.  Countries are encouraged to remain vigilant to the threat of influenza viruses and review any unusual epidemiological patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO advises Member States to maintain surveillance for respiratory pathogens through an integrated approach, considering country context, priorities, resources and capacities. WHO has published &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/379678."&gt;guidance on integrated respiratory virus surveillance. &lt;/a&gt;WHO has also updated &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093881"&gt;guidance on assessing influenza epidemic and pandemic severity&lt;/a&gt;, including the impact on healthcare facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical management and prophylaxis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical care for seasonal influenza focuses on identifying illness severity, assessing risk of progression, and linking to definitive care. Most cases are mild and self-limiting, but severe disease, marked by respiratory distress, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ failure, requires urgent supportive care and often hospitalization. Clinical management of influenza involves high-quality supportive care—oxygen therapy, monitoring, hydration and respiratory support—and is foundational to improving outcomes, especially in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic testing should support rapid decision-making: nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is conditionally recommended for confirmation of suspected disease in severely unwell patients, while either NAAT or digital immunoassay may be used for non-severe cases, depending on context and resource availability. Testing should be performed early with the aim of identifying people in need of treatment and linking them to care, including antivirals where indicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients at high risk of progressing to severe disease are likely to benefit from antiviral to reduce their chance of admission to hospital. High-risk groups include adults ≥65 years, those with immunocompromising conditions, chronic cardiovascular, neurological or respiratory disease; malignancy, pregnancy and diabetes further elevate risk. Individuals ≥85 years or those with multiple risk factors are considered extremely high risk and might be considered for antiviral prophylaxis if exposed to influenza.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infection prevention and control measures in health-care settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonal influenza is known to cause health care-associated infection outbreaks, in particular in long-term care facilities. WHO advises the use of syndromic screening at all entry points to health-care settings and as part of daily inpatient assessment to ensure that patients with suspected or confirmed infections that are transmissible in health-care settings, including influenza, are identified as soon as possible and that appropriate transmission-based precautions are implemented. WHO advises the use of droplet precautions when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed influenza. This includes appropriate patient placement (isolation) of suspected or confirmed cases, and the use of a medical mask by all health and care workers and visitors when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed influenza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appropriate risk assessment for additional personal protective equipment (e.g. eye protection, filtering facepiece respirators, gown, gloves) should be performed by health and care workers when caring for patients with influenza. Increased risk of influenza transmission may occur instances where care activities or patient symptoms are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions onto mucosa of eyes, nose or mouth; or if in close contact with a patient with respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughing/sneezing) and sprays of secretions may reach the mucosa of eyes, nose or mouth directly, or indirectly via contaminated hands. When performing an aerosol-generating procedure on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, patient placement in an airborne infection isolation room as well as airborne and contact precautions with eye protection are advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza disease. Safe and effective vaccines have been used for more than 60 years. Influenza viruses are constantly changing, so the composition of the seasonal influenza vaccine is regularly updated to contain viruses that are more related to those circulating. WHO, through the Global Influenza Programme and GISRS, in collaboration with partners, continuously monitors influenza viruses and activity globally and recommends seasonal influenza vaccine compositions in February and September for the following northern and southern hemisphere influenza seasons, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends annual vaccination for high-risk groups, including health and care workers. People should ideally get vaccinated just before the influenza season begins for the most effective coverage, although getting vaccinated at any time during the influenza season can still help prevent flu infections. While the effectiveness of the vaccine may vary across seasons and risk groups, it reduces disease severity and lowers the chance of complications and death. Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk of influenza complications and their caregivers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic changes or drift can occur in the circulating influenza viruses before or during the influenza season, including during the time between vaccine strain selection and the influenza season. Even if there are some genetic differences between the circulating influenza viruses and the strains that are included in the vaccines, the seasonal influenza vaccine may still provide protection against drifted viruses. Current vaccines include three influenza viruses: influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses. Therefore, circulation of a drifted virus does not always result in seasonal influenza vaccines being less effective in offering protection against influenza associated illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, it remains unclear how the vaccine will protect against clinical disease during this current season. However, early vaccine effectiveness estimates show the current vaccine is 70 to 75% effective at preventing hospital attendance in children aged 2 to 17 years and 30 to 40% effective in adults.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public health and social measures in the community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of appropriate and proportionate public health and social measures (PHSM) is an essential component in the overall response to seasonal influenza epidemics. Measures such as performing hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette as well as voluntary self-isolation and mask wearing of individuals who are symptomatic or have tested positive for influenza viruses can reduce transmission of influenza viruses.  Countries should consider developing a plan to scale up additional PHSM in the event of high or extraordinarily high epidemics.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk communication and community engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Member States should consider to update and strengthen their risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) strategy integrating respiratory viruses. Enhanced risk communication and community engagement approach support empowerment of individuals to make informed decisions, countering misinformation, and community-led protection strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear, regular, evidence-based, culturally acceptable and context adapted RCCE approaches are essential for building and maintaining trust with the concerned and affected populations to ensure adoption of interventions, practices and behaviours. For RCCE efforts to be successful, it is vital that national policies for RCCE incorporate community engagement and feedback mechanisms that acknowledge and address contextual challenges faced by different population groups, particularly those made most vulnerable. The integration of RCCE approaches to promote vaccination against influenza is also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel to or trade with the countries named in this report, based on the information available on the current event.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecticut has its first case of measles in more than four years, according to the Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case is in an unvaccinated Fairfield County child under the age of 10, the department said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The child recently travelled internationally and began showing symptoms of measles several days later, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symptoms included a cough, runny nose, congestion, fever, and then a rash starting at the head and spreading throughout their body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Public Health, measles is highly contagious and can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Measles can be dangerous, especially to children under five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The single best way to protect your children and yourself from measles is to be vaccinated,” said DPH Commissioner Manisha Juthani, MD. “One dose of measles vaccine is about 93% effective, while two doses are about 97% effective. We must ensure we continue to protect those who matter most – children and other&lt;br&gt;vulnerable people – from vaccine preventable illnesses through on-time vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the disease usually begin 7-14 days after a person is exposed to an infected person. Typical cases of measles begin with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a sore throat. Then, three to five days later, the person will develop a red or reddish-brown rash, usually starting on their face at the hairline and then spreading down to the entire body, according to DPH.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;There have been more than 1,800 cases of measles reported nationwide in 2025 -- the most since the virus was declared eliminated in 2000, according to the International Vaccine Access Center.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In recent years, an increasing number of scientific investigations have backed an alarming hypothesis:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="185072" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease may not be merely a condition of an aging brain, &lt;a href="scientists-identify-a-virus-and-two-types-of-bacteria-that-could-be-linked-to-alzheimer-s"&gt;but the product of infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact mechanisms of this infection are something researchers are &lt;a href="scientists-think-alzheimer-s-may-be-caused-by-our-brains-defence-system"&gt;still trying to isolate&lt;/a&gt;, numerous studies suggest the &lt;a href="alzheimers-disease-beta-amyloid-source-outside-brain"&gt;deadly emergence&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's &lt;a href="surgical-tools-could-spreading-alzheimers-proteins"&gt;goes way beyond&lt;/a&gt; what we used to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such study, published in 2019, suggested what could be one of the most definitive leads yet for a bacterial culprit behind Alzheimer's, and it comes from a somewhat unexpected quarter: gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microbes-in-your-mouth-may-impact-your-risk-of-cognitive-decline"&gt;Microbes in Your Mouth May Impact Your Risk of Cognitive Decline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville, researchers reported the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the pathogen behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"&gt;chronic periodontitis&lt;/a&gt; (aka gum disease) – in the brains of deceased Alzheimer's patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the first time the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02788.x"&gt;two factors have been linked&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers went further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In separate experiments with mice, oral infection with the pathogen led to brain colonization by the bacteria, together with increased production of amyloid beta (Aβ), the sticky proteins commonly associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-popular-diet-seems-to-reduce-gum-disease-scientists-say"&gt;This Popular Diet Seems to Reduce Gum Disease, Scientists Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, coordinated by pharma startup Cortexyme, which was co-founded by first author Stephen Dominy, wasn't claiming to have discovered definitive evidence of Alzheimer's causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was clear they thought we had a strong line of investigation here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="/images/2019-01/530-alzheimers-gum-disease-bacteria-1.jpg" alt="530 alzheimers gum disease bacteria 1" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;' gingipains (red) among neurons in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's.

Germany has sauerkraut, Korea has kimchi, China has stinky &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/high-protein-tofu-meals" target="_blank"&gt;tofu&lt;/a&gt;, Japan has &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/miso-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;miso&lt;/a&gt;, but Americans—ever behind gastronomically—don’t have a signature fermented dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But interest in fermented food is growing steadily as people become more cognizant of its far-reaching &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-improve-gut-health" target="_blank"&gt;benefits for the gut&lt;/a&gt;. And unlike some contemporary nutrition trends (looking at you, &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-protein-got-turned-into-cultural-trend" target="_blank"&gt;protein craze&lt;/a&gt;), it’s not all hype: Eating a diet rich in fermented foods really is a big win for your digestion, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/alma-simmons" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/alma-simmons"}' href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/alma-simmons" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Alma Simmons, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells SELF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we’ll break down how exactly fermented foods translate into a &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/health-conditions/digestive-health" target="_blank"&gt;digestive boost&lt;/a&gt;; which fermented foods are best; whether fermented foods pose any health risks; and what you should keep in mind if you’d like to incorporate them into your diet more often. (Number one: “Don't be wary of trying them!” Dr. Burkhart says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are fermented foods so good for gut health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermentation involves the breakdown of &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/what-are-carbohydrates" target="_blank"&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; like sugars and starches by beneficial microorganisms like bacteria, yeasts, and molds, especially lactic acid-producing bacteria. In nutrition-speak, these microorganisms are often termed “&lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/probiotics-vs-prebiotics" target="_blank"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;.” When you ingest these microbes in fermented foods, drinks, or &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/probiotic-supplements-for-gut-health" target="_blank"&gt;probiotic supplements&lt;/a&gt;, they can positively affect your digestive system in a multitude of ways. Not only do they support your gut microbiome—the collection of microorganisms that live in your digestive tract—but they also strengthen the tissue that lines the gut (a.k.a. the “gut barrier”), improve your body’s ability to absorb nutrients, and reduce digestive symptoms like &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-make-yourself-fart" target="_blank"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/why-am-i-so-bloated" target="_blank"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/best-foods-for-diarrhea" target="_blank"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to their GI effects, these microbes can also benefit your health in other ways. They reduce &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-reduce-inflammation-in-the-body" target="_blank"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, mediate your &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/support-immune-system" target="_blank"&gt;immune response&lt;/a&gt;, balance &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/signs-of-high-blood-sugar" target="_blank"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, and lower harmful LDL &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/cholesterol-types" target="_blank"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and triglyceride levels. Plus, “there is some evidence that they can improve mood and cognition,” Dr. Burkhart says. What’s more, she notes, many of these non-digestive perks may boost digestive health indirectly—a “circular effect.” Inflammation, for example, is widely believed to be a factor in &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/health-conditions/autoimmune-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;autoimmune conditions&lt;/a&gt;, including digestive disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/ibs-ibd-difference" target="_blank"&gt;IBD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/health-conditions/celiac-disease" target="_blank"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt;, so by that token &lt;em&gt;decreasing&lt;/em&gt; it could further reduce symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SELF Magazine</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 22:47:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBmUmptQ2Q2OTJid2pxeXUzN0JRX0lEalQzSXhaS01peE9lMUY4SnJjYkZ3SXdKdHdZTlRCd2lnX3hOV0NFWmdjRWFTTTNNLWhna3plSDlJUG5WQkFUcVE3eFp5WDJkYmR3bXJxU2s2Zw</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州麻疹疫情正在“加速” ，数百人被隔离- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/south-carolina-measles-outbreak-accelerating-220728181.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak in South Carolina is “accelerating” with no end in sight following Thanksgiving and other large gatherings, state health officials said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:111 measles cases had been reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;111 measles cases had been reported&lt;/a&gt; in what’s known as upstate South Carolina — an area in the northwest of the state that includes Greenville and Spartanburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are faced with ongoing transmission that we anticipate will go on for many more weeks,” Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said during a news briefing Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seven of those cases have been reported since Friday. “That is a significant increase in our cases in a short period of time,” Bell said. She attributed the spike in part to holiday travel and get-togethers, as well as low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/map-kindergartner-vaccination-rates-are-lowest-rcna229455" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBC News data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NBC News data&lt;/a&gt;, the K-12 vaccination rate for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) in Spartanburg County was 90% for the 2024-25 school year, below the 95% level doctors say is needed to protect against an outbreak. In neighboring Greenville County, the MMR vaccination rate was 90.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department deployed mobile health clinics to the area to provide MMR shots, but few people in the community took advantage. “I can tell you that a relatively small number of doses was administered at each of the mobile health unit clinics that we offered,” Bell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other vaccination clinics are planned, according to the department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are not vaccinated are almost always infected after they’re exposed to the virus; measles is the most contagious known virus in the world and can hang in the air for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current spread in South Carolina is occurring at several schools and a church in Spartanburg County, Bell said, with 254 people under a three-week quarantine. It takes 21 days for symptoms to occur after an exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the ongoing spread in schools, some students who remain unvaccinated are now in a second 21-day quarantine since the beginning of the school year, Bell said. She did not have an exact number of kids in their second quarantine, but said it’s not a “significant proportion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the quarantine includes weekends and holidays, 42 days is a significant amount of time away from the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread of measles is not isolated to South Carolina. On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 1,912 measles cases so far in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of cases have occurred in unvaccinated children and teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks in the Western U.S. are ongoing: 176 in Arizona and 115 in Utah, according to state health officials. One of the Utah cases occurred at a child care facility with a high school in Salt Lake County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infected person was at the facility all day, every day last week (Dec. 1 through Dec. 5), the &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Utah Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Utah Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://montezumacounty.org/public-health-officials-release-information-on-potential-measles-exposures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health officials in Montezuma County, Colorado,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;health officials in Montezuma County, Colorado,&lt;/a&gt; located on the border of Utah and Arizona, reported an unvaccinated child had been diagnosed with measles.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h4o6q001q26p44559bot0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As multiple measles outbreaks simmer across the United States, cases are accumulating nearly as quickly as when the West Texas outbreak was at its peak this spring.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00043b6nm315297y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were 84 new measles cases reported in the past week nationwide, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html?lsdjfld" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; posted Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s more cases than have been reported in a single week since April, when there was an average of about 100 new cases per week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00053b6npjq9fyyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas hasn’t reported any new measles cases since state officials declared that the outbreak there was over in mid-August.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00063b6nqo8z8idr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, case counts are growing quickly in South Carolina, where &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;state health officials say&lt;/a&gt; more than 250 people are in quarantine after possible exposure and 16 are in isolation because of illness. Some of them are in quarantine for a second time because they did not acquire additional protection — through vaccination or natural immunity from an infection — since the first exposure, state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell said at a briefing Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00073b6ncgfcb0rz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a reminder that the maximum incubation period for measles is 21 days, so for any student or anyone to have to go through that quarantine period twice, that’s a significant amount of time,” Bell said. “Vaccination continues to be the best way to prevent the disruption that measles is causing to people’s education, to employment and other factors in people’s lives in our communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00083b6nkq6m6ghg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And new cases in the state are adding up at an accelerating pace, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt00093b6ni56thchw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although there is overall good compliance with quarantine recommendations, Bell said that some factors contributing to the concerning “spike” are holiday gatherings, travel and “lower than hoped for vaccination coverage” for a highly contagious virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000a3b6nwwugglwg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 111 measles cases reported in South Carolina since the outbreak started in October, according to data from the state health department, and at least 105 of those were in people﻿ who had never received a dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended in childhood and offer 97% protection against measles infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000b3b6njyqa28b2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the cases are in the upstate region, near Greenville. The state has reported dozens of new cases since Friday, with most coming from an exposure at a church. Exposures have also occurred at schools and medical settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000c3b6n11vdxuy0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The majority of our cases stem from exposures in known settings. But what we want people to pay attention to is that with each new case in an undervaccinated population, the number of contacts around each new case can spur more and more cases because the disease is so highly infectious,” Bell said. A “similarly rapid increase in vaccination coverage” is important to contain the spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000d3b6n9wtxenlv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles cases also continue to accumulate in Utah and Arizona, where an outbreak along the state line has been growing for months. Arizona has &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 176 cases as of Tuesday — second only to Texa﻿s this year – while Utah has &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 115 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000e3b6nvrhlk13f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s been a record year for measles in the US. Between January and July, there had been close to 1,300 cases reported, more than in any other year since the disease was declared eliminated in the country a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000f3b6n68tmulg8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, the US has recorded more than 1,900 cases for the year, CDC data shows, and the vast majority have been among people who were unvaccinated. If the outbreaks continue into January, the US is at risk of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/28/health/measles-elimination-who-report"&gt;losing its elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed"&gt;Canada did last month&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0h55wt000g3b6n7yi3f0sk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 47 outbreaks in the US in 2025, nearly three times more than there were last year, according to the CDC. An outbreak is defined as three or more cases that are related.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj0hrb9800063b6s8toorxz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 200 people have been hospitalized, and three people — including two children — have died because of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

By reviewing randomized controlled trials that specifically enrolled individuals with elevated inflammatory markers, researchers found that anti-inflammatory treatments significantly reduced both overall depressive symptoms and anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight a distinct biological subtype of depression shaped by immune dysregulation, offering a potential path toward more personalized treatment. Future work will focus on identifying biomarkers that reliably predict who will benefit and on developing safer, targeted anti-inflammatory approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation-Linked Depression:&lt;/strong&gt; Anti-inflammatory drugs reduced depressive severity in people with measurable chronic inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Anhedonia:&lt;/strong&gt; Treatments also lessened anhedonia, suggesting benefits extend beyond mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Results support an immune-related subtype of depression that may respond to tailored interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naoise Mac Giollabhui, PhD, of the Department of Psychiatry at Mass General Brigham, is the lead author of a paper published in &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, “Effect of anti-inflammatory treatment on depressive symptom severity and anhedonia in depressed individuals with elevated inflammation: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.” Richard Liu, PhD, of the Department of Psychiatry at Mass General Brigham, is the senior author.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At any given moment in time, more than 400 million individuals worldwide are battling depression. The antidepressant treatments that we currently have don’t work for many and there is a real need for new, effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 20 years, there has been increasing evidence that some depressed individuals have chronic, low-grade inflammation that might be driving their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This observation of a dysregulated immune system led to clinical trials in which depressed individuals were given a variety of anti-inflammatory treatments. The results of these clinical trials, however, were mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that results may have been mixed because these trials did not target the subset of depressed individuals exhibiting immune dysfunction – if there is no inflammation to begin with, anti-inflammatory medication won’t be very helpful!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, our study was designed to determine whether anti-inflammatory medications are effective when given to depressed individuals who are actively exhibiting chronic, low-grade inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What question were you investigating?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether anti-inflammatory medications are effective in reducing depressive symptom severity and anhedonia (decreased ability to feel pleasure) in a subset of depressed individuals with chronic, low-grade inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What methods or approach did you use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials in which we could determine the effect of anti-inflammatory medication on depressive symptom severity and anhedonia in depressed individuals with elevated levels of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What did you find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified up to 11 randomized controlled trials in which anti-inflammatory medications were administered in up to 321 depressed individuals with elevated levels of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that anti-inflammatory medications significantly reduced both depressive symptom severity and anhedonia at the study endpoint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What are the implications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that there is a subtype of depression characterized by a dysregulated immune system that could be effectively treated using anti-inflammatory medications and lifestyle-based interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What are the next steps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work that needs to be done to develop immune biomarkers that more accurately identify who will benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment for depression and to develop treatment approaches that selectively target dysfunctional inflammatory physiology. At the moment, some of the more potent anti-inflammatory medications have serious side-effects that make them sub-optimal for use in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship: &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to Mac Giollabhui and Liu, Mass General Brigham authors include Melis Lydston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This work was supported by grants from  the National Institute of Mental Health (K23MH132893, NMG; R01 MH115905, RTL; R01 MH124899, RTL; R21 MH130767, RTL; R01MH137793, RTL; K24 MH136418, RTL), a L.I.F.E.

The study found that targeting this subgroup produces the clearest therapeutic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1765401694754"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Do anti-inflammatory medications help all people with depression?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; No. The analysis suggests these treatments are effective only when inflammation is present. For individuals without immune dysregulation, anti-inflammatory drugs do not appear to reduce symptoms, highlighting the need for personalized treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1765401694211"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What types of anti-inflammatory treatments were evaluated in the meta-analysis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The trials included a range of anti-inflammatory approaches, from pharmaceutical agents that directly lower inflammation to medications that modulate immune signaling.

In this preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis, the authors evaluated whether anti-inflammatory treatments, compared to placebo, reduce anhedonia and depressive symptom severity in depressed individuals with an inflammatory phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors included randomized controlled trials of pharmacological anti-inflammatory treatments that assessed anhedonia or depressive symptom severity and recruited depressed individuals with an inflammatory phenotype or measured baseline inflammatory biomarkers that permitted post hoc analysis. A search was conducted in February 2025 of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and PsycINFO. Multiple reviewers independently applied criteria, and discrepancies were resolved via consensus. Two reviewers independently extracted data and cross-checked for errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In randomized controlled trials (k=11) using an established cutoff for elevated inflammation (C-reactive protein ≥2 mg/L), both anhedonia (Hedges’ g=0.40, 95% CI=0.08, 0.71) and depressive symptoms (Hedges’ g=0.35, 95% CI=0.05, 0.64) were reduced, but no differences in treatment response (relative risk=1.28, 95% CI=0.997, 1.64) or remission rates (relative risk=1.18, 95% CI=0.71, 1.95) were observed. Results did not vary by clinical, interventional, or demographic characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-inflammatory treatments may be safe and effective at reducing depressive symptoms and anhedonia in depressed individuals with heightened inflammation. Not accounting for inflammatory status may help explain prior mixed findings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 21:47:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1ybWlLX0tEeEwyUjQxWGxkT0pid250YUFaSGxRVGRReWROM290OGdhNEJQb2c0S193bUFsSVhTdVBzLU0xUHlHa1p3LVA2M0VlQ2ZvcVlvRndPM3JyZEs4ZmdFNjFSSTE5YUkyQXFCX205QUtK</guid></item><item><title>由于诺如病毒爆发的“加剧传播” ，梅德福学校取消了课程- WCVB</title><link>https://www.wcvb.com/article/medford-school-cancels-classes-due-to-norovirus-outbreak/69689994</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;

The country first gained elimination status in 2000.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighty-eight percent of cases in the United States this year are outbreak-associated, and there have been 47 outbreaks recorded. Last year, 16 outbreaks were reported during 2024 and 69% of cases (198 of 285) were outbreak-associated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently Utah, Arizona, and South Carolina are seeing large outbreaks that since Thanksgiving have pushed state totals well past 100 cases. Those outbreaks have been marked by exposures at schools and churches in communities with low vaccination levels.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utah-Arizona outbreak grows to 254 cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/health/south-carolina-upstate-measles-outbreak-8-new-cases-schools-impacted/275-6ab8cf79-93ad-4af5-9390-4bd6c728fbb2"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In South Carolina&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 281 students at eight schools in the Upstate region are in quarantine.

At the same time, fewer people are getting their flu shots. It’s not too late to get your shot. Photo: Getty Images.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer people are getting their annual flu shots this year, just as flu infections are rising and the ominous new “K” flu variant is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Colorado, only about 25% of people have gotten their flu shots so far this fall, &lt;a id="" href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/respiratory-virus-immunization-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s down from about 27% of people who had gotten their flu shots by this time last year. And it’s a significant drop from the 32% of Coloradans who got flu shots during the entire winter respiratory virus season in 2024 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While misinformation about vaccines has driven down the number of people who are getting all types of vaccines — including those that protect people from the flu — the drop in the percentage of Coloradans who are getting annual flu shots comes at a particularly dangerous time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because a new flu variant has been surging around the world and has caused bad, early flu outbreaks in Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada. This variant, known as the Type A H3N2 “subclade K” is now spreading in Colorado and across the U.S., prompting warnings from infectious disease experts that we could face a tough flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the U.S., 20,000 to 30,000 people still die every year from the flu,” said &lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.org/provider/michelle-barron-md/"&gt;Dr. Michelle Barron&lt;/a&gt;, UCHealth’s senior medical director for infection control and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s not insignificant,” said Barron, who is also a &lt;a id="" href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/8603" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;professor of medicine and infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a id="" href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;University of Colorado School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.org/locations/uchealth-at-university-of-colorado-anschutz-medical-campus/"&gt;Anschutz Campus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the “K” variant, which soon could become dominant in the U.S., appears to be especially good at evading vaccines and bypassing our bodies’ immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This year’s flu shot isn’t perfect, but you should still get it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though this year’s flu shot is a “mismatch” for the “K” variant, that doesn’t mean you should skip getting flu vaccines for yourself and your family members, Barron said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a flu shot still protects people from getting severely ill or dying if they get the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why Barron’s advice is simple and clear. If you haven’t gotten your flu shot yet or made an appointment to get your kids vaccinated, do it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s never too late. Now that we’re seeing an uptick in flu cases, it’s a great time to go get your vaccine because the numbers will continue to rise,” Barron said. “You’re going to need that extra level of protection as more people get sick and as more people will be traveling or having visitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron encouraged people to enjoy fun times with family and friends rather than picking up a lousy respiratory virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The worst part of the holiday season is if you’re sick and stuck in bed. You want to be able to go out and enjoy the holidays,” Barron said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the flu, we asked Barron for answers to your top questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you expect the 2025-2026 respiratory virus season to be bad for the flu? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion about vaccines is driving down vaccination rates. When fewer people are protected, viruses can spread more easily and make more people sick, Barron said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates are lower across the board, and some people who don’t want COVID-19 vaccines are also skipping flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron encourages people to talk with their providers and get both their flu and COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Flu is a separate virus (from the one that causes COVID-19),” Barron said. “People are going to get really sick from the flu this year. The very young, the very old and people with underlying medical conditions are at the greatest risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/flu-in-colorado-what-to-do-if-youre-feeling-lousy/"&gt;Last year’s flu season&lt;/a&gt; also was very severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 27,000 to 130,000 &lt;a id="" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;people died&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. due to the flu. And a record number of children — at least 279 — died of confirmed flu cases during the 2024 and 2025 flu season, &lt;a id="" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nearly all of these children previously were healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting vaccines can help prevent the tragic deaths of young and old people alike. That’s why Barron said it’s so critical for people to get their vaccines now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What new flu virus is going around? How did the ‘K’ variant develop, and should I worry about it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s normal for viruses to change. As they spread, they mutate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple strains of the influenza A and B viruses; however, in general, there are specific strains that emerge and cause yearly outbreaks that give rise to our traditional flu season, which can stretch from September through April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common influenza A strains that are circulating these days are H1N1 and H3N2. This year, the H3N2 strain changed more than it typically does, and multiple mutations have given birth to the “K” variant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re like copying errors,” Barron said. “It has a number of mutations. This is common. Flu mutates all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the timing of the “K” strain’s emergence has been challenging. Vaccine makers already had created flu shots. This year’s version includes components that will allow your immune system to fight H3N2 strains, but they don’t specifically fight the “K” variant because it’s too new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron says the “K” variant is complicating the ability of this year’s flu shot to fight the flu. She said it’s like mailing a package to someone but using the wrong ZIP code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You change one number on the ZIP code, and it could send your mail next door, down the street or 50 miles away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a vaccine, the “ZIP code” tells your body exactly where to hunt down intruders that can make you sick. If the vaccine has bad directions and is hunting for an older version of the H3N2 strain, you’ll get some protection, but the vaccine may not fully protect you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vaccines still work. Your body will know that the virus is present. But these mutations can evade your immune system. When the strains in the vaccine don’t match what is circulating in the community, you have a vaccine mismatch,” Barron said. “The flu shot still protects you. When it’s a mismatch, you might get sick, but the vaccine decreases the likelihood that you will be hospitalized and decreases the likelihood that you will die from complications of the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges related to the “K” variant and the way that it has behaved in other countries have sparked concern for infectious disease experts like Barron. She and many other pros are keeping a close eye on how the “K” variant will affect flu cases here in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Colorado, when doctors test hospital patients for the flu (and other respiratory viruses), they send the lab samples to experts at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Workers at the state lab then test the samples to determine exactly which strains of the flu are spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the majority of flu samples that lab workers are testing have been the subclade “K” strain. (&lt;a id="" href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/viral-respiratory-diseases-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;View data&lt;/a&gt; about influenza and other respiratory viruses from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How concerned are you about the drop in flu shots and decreased rates for other vaccines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron is very concerned that vaccination rates are declining, and more people will get sick and will need to be hospitalized. Some will die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing a lot less uptake of the flu vaccine than we’ve seen historically, and that’s not a good trend, especially because we know these vaccines (flu and COVID-19) are very good and reduce the severity of illness,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron strongly encourages anyone who has doubts about vaccines to speak directly with their medical providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vaccine misinformation is not based on sound science, and it’s causing a lot of distrust,” Barron said. “My hope is that people will still consult with their providers. They know you and the nuances about your health. When they make a recommendation for you — whether it’s to get a flu vaccine or COVID-19 or a pneumonia shot, it’s because they know you and they want to keep you healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the greatest concern as we head into what could be a tough flu season?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barron said it’s particularly heartbreaking to see children die of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These were generally healthy kids. Parents may think a flu shot is not a big deal. But even healthy kids have immune systems that are not as mature. And that just makes them more vulnerable,” she said. “It distresses me greatly when parents don’t fully understand the risks and don’t get their children vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why her message is so simple. Go get vaccines for yourself and your kids. Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
            
                          
                        &lt;/div&gt;

By analyzing both the timing and frequency of brain activity, the model uncovered distinct patterns: broader disruption across multiple regions in Alzheimer’s and more localized frontal and temporal changes in frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system also estimated disease severity, offering clinicians faster insight than traditional tools. These findings suggest that affordable EEG technology, paired with advanced AI, may streamline diagnosis and personalize care for people experiencing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EEG Biomarkers:&lt;/strong&gt; Slow delta waves in frontal and central areas signaled disease in both conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Alzheimer’s showed widespread disruption, while frontotemporal dementia remained more localized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Accuracy:&lt;/strong&gt; A two-stage deep learning system reached 84% accuracy in separating the two disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia is a group of disorders that gradually impair memory, thinking and daily functioning. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, affects about 7.2 million Americans aged 65 and older in 2025. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), while rarer, is the second most common cause of early-onset dementia, often striking people in their 40s to 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-114323"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/ai-eeg-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Overall, the study shows that deep learning can streamline dementia diagnosis by combining detection and severity assessment in one system, cutting down on lengthy evaluations and giving clinicians real-time tools to track disease progression. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although both diseases damage the brain, they do so in distinct ways. AD primarily affects memory and spatial awareness, while FTD targets regions responsible for behavior, personality and language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because their symptoms can overlap, it often leads to misdiagnosis. Distinguishing between them is not just a scientific challenge but a clinical necessity, as accurate diagnosis can profoundly affect treatment, care and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MRI and PET scans are effective for diagnosing AD but are costly, time-consuming and require specialized equipment. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a portable, non-invasive and affordable alternative by measuring brain activity with sensors across various frequency bands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, signals are often noisy and vary between individuals, making analysis difficult. Even with machine learning applications to EEG data, results are inconsistent and differentiating AD from FTD remains difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle this issue, researchers from the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University have created a deep learning model that detects and evaluates AD and FTD. It boosts EEG accuracy and interpretability by analyzing both frequency- and time-based brain activity patterns linked to each disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,&lt;/em&gt; found that slow delta brain waves were an important biomarker for both AD and FTD, mainly in the frontal and central regions of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In AD, brain activity was more widely disrupted, also affecting other regions of the brain and frequency bands like beta, indicating more extensive brain damage. These differences help explain why AD is typically easier to detect than FTD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model achieved more than&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;90% accuracy in distinguishing individuals with dementia (AD or FTD) from cognitively normal participants. It also predicted disease severity with relative errors of less than 35% for AD and 15.5% for FTD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because AD and FTD share similar symptoms and brain activity, telling them apart was difficult. Using feature selection, the researchers boosted the model’s specificity – how well it identified people without the disease – from 26% to 65%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their two-stage design – first detecting healthy individuals, then separating AD from FTD – achieved 84% accuracy, ranking among the best EEG-based methods so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model merges convolutional neural networks and attention-based LSTMs to detect both the type and severity of dementia from EEG data. Grad-CAM shows which brain signals influenced the model, helping clinicians understand its decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach offers a new view of how brain activity evolves and which regions and frequencies drive diagnosis – something traditional tools rarely capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What makes our study novel is how we used deep learning to extract both spatial and temporal information from EEG signals,” said Tuan Vo, first author and a doctoral student in the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By doing this, we can detect subtle brainwave patterns linked to Alzheimer’s and frontotemporal dementia that would otherwise go unnoticed. Our model doesn’t just identify the disease – it also estimates how severe it is, offering a more complete picture of each patient’s condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also revealed that AD tends to be more severe, impacting a wider range of brain areas and leading to lower cognitive scores, while FTD’s effects are more localized to the frontal and temporal lobes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights align with previous neuroimaging studies but add new depth by showing how these patterns appear in EEG data – an inexpensive and noninvasive diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that Alzheimer’s disease disrupts brain activity more broadly, especially in the frontal, parietal and temporal regions, while frontotemporal dementia mainly affects the frontal and central areas,” said Hanqi Zhuang, Ph.D., co-author and associate dean and professor, FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This difference explains why Alzheimer’s is often easier to detect. However, our work also shows that careful feature selection can significantly improve how well we distinguish FTD from Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study shows that deep learning can streamline dementia diagnosis by combining detection and severity assessment in one system, cutting down on lengthy evaluations and giving clinicians real-time tools to track disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work demonstrates how merging engineering, AI and neuroscience can transform how we confront major health challenges,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With millions affected by Alzheimer’s and frontotemporal dementia, breakthroughs like this open the door to earlier detection, more personalized care, and interventions that can truly improve lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-authors are Ali K. Ibrahim, Ph.D., an assistant professor of teaching; and Chiron Bang, a doctoral student, both with the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1765399429500"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What makes diagnosing Alzheimer’s and frontotemporal dementia difficult?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Their symptoms and EEG signatures often overlap, leading to misdiagnosis without specialized imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1765399430912"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the model improve EEG-based detection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It analyzes spatial and temporal features simultaneously, revealing subtle brainwave differences missed by standard methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1765399430648"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Does the system also measure Alzheimer’s disease severity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes — it estimates severity levels for both conditions, helping clinicians track progression more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#caadadaba6a5bfb9be8aacabbfe4afaebf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gisele Galoustian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fau.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gisele Galoustian – FAU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2025.108667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Extraction and interpretation of EEG features for diagnosis and severity prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease and Frontotemporal dementia using deep learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Tuan Vo et al. &lt;em&gt;Biomedical Signal Processing and Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extraction and interpretation of EEG features for diagnosis and severity prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease and Frontotemporal dementia using deep learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the second most common form of dementia, affects the frontal and temporal lobes, causing changes in personality, behavior, and language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to overlapping symptoms, FTD is often misdiagnosed as AD. Although electroencephalography (EEG) is portable, non-invasive, and cost-effective, its diagnostic potential for AD and FTD is limited by the similarities between the two diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, we introduce an EEG-based feature extraction method to identify and predict the severity of AD and FTD using deep learning. Key findings include increased delta band activities in the frontal and central regions as biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By extracting temporal and spectral features from EEG signals, our model combines a Convolutional Neural Network with an attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (aLSTM) network, achieving over 90% accuracy in distinguishing AD and FTD from cognitively normal (CN) individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also predicts severity with relative errors of less than 35% for AD and approximately 15.5% for FTD. Differentiating FTD from AD remains challenging due to shared characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, applying a feature selection procedure improves the specificity in separating AD from FTD, increasing it from 26% to 65%. Building on this, we developed a two-stage approach to classify AD, CN, and FTD simultaneously. In this approach, CN is identified first, followed by the differentiation of FTD from AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method achieves an overall accuracy of 84% in classifying AD, CN, and FTD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 20:57:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1fVGhhcFU5aVphRk5QcU13NTJwWHpHUUpuSVNBdGdRR1dCaVVpQzRaOVA5QXpLY1BQQzhITWk1SWt6N0p5eVYwcWZLd2pBWDBfdzJ0MlFzRFktMC11RC1aX3RYTV9fdnQxR29RZVk1cDd5TEdj</guid></item><item><title>14种精神疾病的遗传重叠解释了患者通常有多种诊断的原因- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-12-genetic-overlap-psychiatric-disorders-patients.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;
