			&lt;p&gt;Is it an achievable goal to remain mentally sharp while aging, or is it a pipe dream?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's entirely possible if you cultivate habits throughout your life that are beneficial to brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a researcher in cognitive neuroscience and the neuropsychology of aging processes, I aim to shed light on the ways we can maintain good cognitive health while aging in light of recent scientific advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The importance of cognitive reserve&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective strategies research has identified is developing and maintaining good cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve refers to the brain's ability to resist the effects of aging or neurodegenerative diseases without resulting in significant functional decline. This concept is now central to approaches for preventing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its report &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dementia prevention, intervention, and care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, updated in 2024, the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; highlighted the fact that 45 per cent of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed by addressing 14 modifiable risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors include physical inactivity,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="177929" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one of the earliest and most significant factors is having a low level of education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond education&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education has long been considered the main indicator of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355617702813248"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;. It reflects prolonged exposure to intellectually stimulating activities that promote the development of effective brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this view is now considered incomplete. Cognitive reserve is not fixed in childhood or adulthood: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.07.219"&gt;it can be built, maintained and even amplified throughout life&lt;/a&gt; through different experiences including learning, rich social interactions and cognitively stimulating leisure activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific examples of these activities include playing a musical instrument or complex board games such as chess, or participating in volunteer activities that require planning and problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding cognitive reserve&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research offers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1684/nrp.2016.0394"&gt;several complementary models&lt;/a&gt; for understanding the mechanisms of cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some focus on the structure of the brain itself, suggesting that characteristics such as the number of neurons influence the brain's tolerance to damage. This is the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0894-4105.7.3.273"&gt;brain reserve model&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on the idea that some people are born with a greater number of neurons, enabling them to cope better with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others argue that active lifestyles can slow down the effects of brain aging by strengthening biological resilience — for example, the brain's ability to remain intact and functional as it ages, showing few visible signs of deterioration despite age. This is the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2012.04.005"&gt;brain maintenance model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third set of models emphasizes the functional flexibility of the brain, which allows it to mobilize its resources differently or recruit alternative neural networks to compensate for age-related losses. This is known as the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.03.004"&gt;cognitive reserve model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These different models are part of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.07.219"&gt;common conceptual framework&lt;/a&gt; that distinguishes between brain reserve, brain maintenance and cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each model is based on a specific idea, but they are complementary and supported by empirical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cognitive reserve model remains the most widely studied, particularly because of its link to modifiable factors such as level of education and regular participation in cognitively stimulating activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177976" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177976" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ElderWomenPlayingChess-e1760653217648.jpg" alt="Older women playing chess" class="wp-image-177976 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177976" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Choosing leisure activities that require brain power can help us maintain cognitive health well into old age.

Above all, it reminds us that far from being a fixed entity, cognitive reserve evolves due to interactions with experience and learning, and can therefore be strengthened throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="alignnone wp-image-177073 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent work supports this dynamic view. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458022002251?via%3Dihub"&gt;A team of Québec researchers, of which I am a member&lt;/a&gt;, has shown that structured learning of memory strategies, including the method of loci (associating each piece of information with a familiar place) or mental visualization (transforming information into images to better retain it), can induce significant changes in brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of increases and decreases in activation, including variations in the level of activity in different areas of the brain, was observed in different brain regions during the phases of learning and recalling information. This observation reflects the fact that the use of memory strategies allows for greater functional flexibility in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also showed that in more educated individuals, certain regions are activated in a more targeted manner during learning and recall, suggesting that their brains use more effective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other research has also highlighted the role of education in brain structure and function. A study I conducted with colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-016-9621-7"&gt;highlighted an association between years of schooling, volume of grey matter and brain activation in the context of memory&lt;/a&gt;. Another study in which I participated showed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2022.02.001"&gt;greater flexibility of activation according to task complexity in more educated individuals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this research confirms that cognitive reserve can be developed with experience and modulated by cognitive training at any age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stimulating your brain while having fun&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same vein, the Engage study by the &lt;a href="https://ccna-ccnv.ca"&gt;Canadian Consortium on Aging and Neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt; aims to study the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of cognitively stimulating leisure activities in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hybrid intervention combines formal cognitive training (memorization strategies, attention) with structured leisure activities such as learning music, a second language or video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It offers an ecological model — in other words, an approach that is close to real-life conditions, enjoyable and motivating and conducive to sustained engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By demonstrating that these natural interventions produce effects comparable to those of traditional cognitive training program, which often consist of repetitive exercises done on a computer or on paper to work on functions such as memory or concentration, Engage could transform approaches to preventing age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learning another language&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my neuropsychology of aging laboratory (&lt;a href="http://www.uqtr.ca/neuropsychologieduvieillissement"&gt;NeuroÂge&lt;/a&gt;) at the University of Québec at Trois-Rivières (UQTR), we are conducting a complementary project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with professors Paul John, from the Department of Modern Languages and Translation, and Simon Rigoulot, from the Department of Psychology, we are exploring the effects of learning English as a second language on cognition and brain activity in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a protocol that integrates classes, tutoring and cognitive and electroencephalography measurements, this project aims to document the cognitive and neural benefits of meaningful, motivating and accessible learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary results are promising and support the idea that intellectual engagement, even when started later in life, can generate measurable benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining good cognitive health at any age requires a combination of accessible, motivating and stimulating interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve, far from being fixed, is built up throughout life. Advances in research now offer us concrete tools for healthy aging, particularly when it comes to cognitive health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266451/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area. It’s notoriously contagious — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;nine out of 10 unvaccinated people&lt;/a&gt; near someone with measles can become infected, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RQIOAX4PY5EPRIRQTWRXA3U7DM"&gt;Measles typically starts with symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. A few days later, a characteristic red rash breaks out, usually starting on the face and spreading downward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R3BJ7WHIIFAZREE6TFDX2BWFCQ"&gt;The disease can also lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and, in rare cases, death. According to the CDC, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;three confirmed measles-related deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EWZG4IPV3ZA4NOZLTZTQVJGVLU"&gt;Oregon health officials have &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/06/oregon-confirms-first-measles-case-of-2025-linked-to-international-travel.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/06/oregon-confirms-first-measles-case-of-2025-linked-to-international-travel.html"&gt;confirmed only one case of measles&lt;/a&gt; so far this year — an unvaccinated adult from Multnomah County who tested positive in June after returning from an overseas trip. Last year, the state recorded 31 confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BNHZAIS2YFC7PHQ3CZVLTFAIGQ"&gt;Across the U.S., the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;CDC has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; 1,573 measles this year.

The voices in my head just completely went silent. I got instantly addicted," she remembers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The little blue pills Kayla became hooked on were probably made in Mexico, and then smuggled across the border to the US - a deadly trade President Donald Trump is trying to crack down on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But drug cartels aren't pharmacists. So, Kayla never knew how much fentanyl was in the pill she was taking. Would there be enough of the synthetic opioid to kill her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's scary to think about that," Kayla says, reflecting on how she could have overdosed and died at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In 2023, there were over 110,000 drug-related deaths in the US. The march of fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, seemed unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But then came a staggering turnaround. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In 2024, the number of fatal overdoses across the US fell by around 25%. That's nearly 30,000 fewer deaths – dozens of lives saved every day. Kayla's state, North Carolina, is at the forefront of that trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 cnKFtO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Why fatal overdoses have fallen so sharply&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;One of the explanations is a commitment to harm reduction. This means promoting policies that prioritise drug users' health and wellbeing rather than criminalising people - a recognition that in an era of fentanyl, drug-taking too often ends with death by overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In North Carolina, where Kayla still lives, and where overdose fatalities are currently down by an impressive 35%, harm reduction strategies are well-developed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Kayla no longer takes street drugs. And she's a client of an innovative law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programme in Fayetteville. It's a partnership between the town's police and the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition. Together, they work to divert substance users away from crime, and get them on the road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d23/live/69247650-a915-11f0-b5e8-25b94b51d777.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Mansel Ly Jamaal Littlejohn poses in front of a police car" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Tim Mansel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Lt Jamaal Littlejohn watched his own sister deal with substance use disorder&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"If someone's stealing from a grocery store, we run their criminal history.

"Most of our folks are working - once they're sober, they show up to work on time every day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The clinic runs a finely-tuned operation. After patients check in, they're called to a dosing window to receive their prescription. They're in and out in minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;They'll randomly be drug tested for illicit narcotics. Dr Morse says around half his patients are still testing positive for opioids bought on the street, but he doesn't see this as failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Maybe you're using once a week and you're used to using three times a day… You're still playing Russian roulette with fentanyl but you've taken a whole bunch of bullets out of the chamber, so your survival rate goes up significantly," says Dr Morse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This is harm reduction.  So rather than be expelled from the treatment programme, patients who get a positive drug test are given extra support and counselling.  Dr Morse says 80-90% will eventually stop using street drugs altogether.  And in time, many will taper off their medication too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;The abstinence debate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 geRyoc"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2876/live/9b086a40-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Mansel Mark Pless speaks to the BBC" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Tim Mansel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Not everyone thinks this is the right approach.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mark Pless is a Republican who sits in North Carolina's state House of Representatives, and used to be a full-time paramedic. He points out that illegal drug-taking starts with a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt; And he doesn't believe in harm reduction. In particular he's against treating opioid use disorder with medications like methadone or buprenorphine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"You're replacing an addictive product with another addictive product," he says. "If you have to take it in order to stay clean, it's still addictive.

Some people use test-strips to check for fentanyl, because they know it's been implicated in so many fatal overdoses.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But the strips don't identify all potentially harmful substances. Dr Dasgupta runs a national drugs-testing laboratory. Users send him a tiny bit of their drug supply via local non-profit organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We've analysed close to 14,000 samples from 43 states over the last three years," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;A generational shift&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Testing drugs for potentially dangerous additives is an additional weapon in the harm reduction armoury. Dr Dasgupta believes another reason for decreasing overdose fatalities in the US is that young people are avoiding opioids like fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We see a demographic shift. Generation Z are dying of overdose much less frequently than their parents or their grandparents' generations were at the same age," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Dr Dasgupta isn't entirely surprised 20-somethings are steering clear of opioids. A shocking four out of 10 American adults know someone whose life has been ended by an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It was this epidemic of death, set in train in the 1990s by prescription opioids, that motivated North Carolina's former attorney general - now the state governor - to move against powerful corporations benefitting from so many Americans' dark spiral down into addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Josh Stein picked up the phone to his counterparts in other states, and took a leading role in co-ordinating legal action against opioid manufacturers, distributors and retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6b25/live/fd5d7320-a916-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Mansel Josh Stein speaks to the BBC" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Tim Mansel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;North Carolina Governor Josh Stein took a leading role in co-ordinating legal action against opioid manufacturers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"There was a Republican attorney general in Tennessee, I'm Democrat in North Carolina… But we're all caring about our people and we're all willing to fight for them," Stein reflects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The upshot, after years of intense negotiations, was an Opioid Settlement totalling some $60bn (£45bn). This is money that huge companies have agreed to pay to US states, to be used for the "abatement of the opioid epidemic". North Carolina's share is around $1.5bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It has to be spent in four ways – drug prevention, treatment, recovery, or harm reduction. I think it's transformative," says Governor Stein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Meanwhile, funding from the national government is uncertain. The cuts to Medicaid included in President Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act could have a tremendous impact on this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In the Morse Clinics in Raleigh, 70% of patients depend on Medicaid. If they lose health insurance, will they end treatment and become more vulnerable to death by overdose? Although North Carolina's drug fatality statistics look optimistic, thousands of people are still dying - and the state's black, indigenous and non-white populations haven't experienced the same rates of decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And there remain other states that have witnessed a stubbornly slower rate of decrease in lethal overdoses - including Nevada and Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251015-170100-8e96f025b0-web-2.31.4-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9bae/live/3b76aaa0-a917-11f0-85e5-b7e4f930730c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Mansel Charlton Roberson speaks to the BBC" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Tim Mansel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Kayla credits Charlton Roberson, her mentor at North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition, with being instrumental in her recovery&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;No one is complacent.

Nationally, there have been over 1,500 cases reported so far this year—five times more cases than last year." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine, she noted, is highly effective, providing about 97% protection with two doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious, spreading through the air via coughs or sneezes, and can lead to severe complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health advises those at high risk, including young children, adults over 20, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immune systems, to contact healthcare providers if exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MMR vaccine remains the best preventive measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 23:35:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxPS2J2bXEzZE1qamYxLVk3VDVtek5ELWtGTDdVUFNDRHcwS3JOVy11UWZubDNTV2diaEVWbXRPb0NjRTZjbXhIT0lOM25FTk0zU1hSS1NOYXRBQjhNemxiMW0ycVVDWmo4WjJHNERpbGhvV2NPb1A5UklHM3pGYnFPV2xJLUUteWNpQTEyVDJTWHhNbDdQY21QdmYzQnBjdEJjckRmTlV6UXh2ZVFpY0F0Wm42enVuWTViWkFnZlZqUzlrd2pTQTBqSTlOX05SdGZs</guid></item><item><title>阴道疾病治疗更新：男性也应接受治疗- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/vaginal-condition-treatment-update-men-should-get-treated-too/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;For some cases of bacterial vaginosis, treatment should include a package deal, doctors now say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American College of Obstetricians &amp;amp; Gynecologists (ACOG) &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/10/acog-recommends-concurrent-sexual-partner-treatment-recurrent-bacterial-vaginosis-first-time"&gt;updated its clinical guidance&lt;/a&gt; Friday to fit with &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa2405404"&gt;recent data&lt;/a&gt; indicating that treatment for recurring bacterial vaginosis (BV) in women is significantly more effective &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; their male partners are also treated at the same time—with both an oral antibiotic and an antibiotic cream directly onto the potentially offending member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Partner therapy offers us another avenue for hopefully preventing recurrence and helping people feel better faster,” Christopher Zahn, chief of clinical practice and health equity and quality at ACOG, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BV is a common condition affecting nearly 30 percent of women worldwide. Still, it’s potentially stigmatizing and embarrassing, with symptoms including itching, burning, a concerning fishy smell, and vaginal discharge that can be green or gray. With symptoms like this, BV is often described as an infection—but it’s actually not. BV is an imbalance in the normal bacterial communities that inhabit the vagina—a situation called dysbiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This imbalance can be especially difficult to correct; of the women who suffer with BV, up to 66 percent will end up having the condition recur after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BV symptoms are “incredibly uncomfortable and disrupt people’s daily lives,” Zahn said, and that discomfort “becomes compounded by frustration when this condition comes back repeatedly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Firm recommendation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies in recent years have started to expose the reasons behind recurrence. Though again, BV is an imbalance, it has the profile of a sexually transmitted infection, with links to new sexual partners and similar incubation periods. Going further, microbial communities of penises can silently harbor the bacterial species linked to BV, and penile microbial communities can be predictive of BV risk in partners.&lt;/p&gt;

						The South Carolina Department of Public Health says there have been three new confirmed cases of measles in Spartanburg County since Tuesday, bringing the total number of cases in the state this year to 19 and the total number of cases in the current outbreak to 15.Health officials say all three cases were among close contacts to known cases who have been quarantining at home, and none were present in any school setting while contagious. Officials say since they were quarantining before they became infectious, no additional exposures have occurred with these new cases.Prisma Health says in order to proactively address the current measles outbreak in South Carolina, the hospital has implemented enhanced masking protocols across all emergency departments to help protect patients, visitors and staff.Masking upon entry: All individuals entering the Emergency Department are required to wear a mask until they have been evaluated at triage.Safety-first approach: These measures are designed to reduce the risk of transmission and ensure a safe environment for everyone during this outbreak.Symptom-based masking: Patients presenting with fever, rash or respiratory symptoms will be asked to continue masking while inside any Prisma Health facility.Parental precautions: Unvaccinated parents accompanying children with fever and rash may also be asked to wear a mask.Dr. Anna Cathryn Burch is a pediatric infectious disease physician and says if you have had two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, then you have lifelong immunity. For those who are just getting a vaccine, Burch says it usually takes about two weeks to make antibodies against the measles virus. She also says it's the easiest virus to spread on the planet."The droplets within the virus that somebody might cough up when they're sick with the virus can stay in the air for up to two hours, even after the person who is infected with the measles has left the room," Burch said.

                  &lt;p&gt;Health authorities in Japan are urging people to take precautions against influenza. They say cases nationwide have surged by about 50 percent in the space of a week.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                    
                  &lt;p&gt;The Japan Institute for Health Security and others say there were 9,074 cases reported by more than 3,000 medical institutions nationwide in the seven days through last Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
        
                    
                  &lt;p&gt;The average number of patients per institution was 2.36, up 0.8 from a week earlier. The figure rose in 44 of the country's 47 prefectures.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A new study shows that cognitive training can increase the levels of a key chemical messenger in the brain responsible for decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists have produced the first compelling evidence that mental exercise can cause biological changes in a human brain. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on a new study showing that intensive cognitive training reversed a process associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: The internet is filled with brain-training programs that promise to improve thinking and memory. But Etienne de Villers-Sidani of McGill University in Canada says it's been hard to know whether they really work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ETIENNE DE VILLERS-SIDANI: They had a positive impact on some cognitive measures, but then the question was, how much is it changing the brain, and how is it changing the brain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: So De Villers-Sidani and a team of researchers decided to see whether mental exercise could increase levels of a chemical messenger that's closely associated with cognitive performance. It's called acetylcholine. He says levels tend to fall starting in middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DE VILLERS-SIDANI: For every decade after the age of 40, 45, you get around 2.5% decline in this neurotransmitter in key brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: The decline is much faster in people with Alzheimer's disease. The researchers studied 92 healthy people who were at least 65 years old. De Villers-Sidani says during the 10-week study, half of the participants spent 30 minutes a day doing mental exercises. These came from a science-backed cognitive training program called Brain HQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DE VILLERS-SIDANI: Which is really targeted at attention and speed of processing, and its characteristic is that it kind of pushes you to the limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: By asking you to remember more and more in less and less time - other participants spent their time playing video games like Solitaire and Candy Crush. The researchers used a special kind of PET scan to detect changes in acetylcholine levels. De Villers-Sidani says they focused on the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that's important for making decisions and detecting errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DE VILLERS-SIDANI: I was not sure we would find anything, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: But they did. In people who played video games, acetylcholine levels were unchanged. But De Villers-Sidani says in people who did cognitive training, there was a meaningful increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DE VILLERS-SIDANI: It was about 2.3%, which is not huge, but it's significant considering that you get a 2.5% decrease per decade, normally just with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: So at least in this brain area, cognitive training appeared to turn back the clock by about 10 years. Acetylcholine levels also increased in other brain areas, including the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, appears in the journal JMIR Serious Games. Michael Hasselmo, a neuroscientist at Boston University, says he was impressed by the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL HASSELMO: It was compelling enough that I looked up the task myself and thought, maybe I need to be doing this task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Hasselmo has spent much of his career studying acetylcholine, which is a chemical messenger that also modulates the behavior of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HASSELMO: If you block the neuromodulator function in the brain with a drug such as scopolamine, a person can't even think. You basically go into a delirious state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Low levels of acetylcholine are a hallmark of Alzheimer's and appear to contribute to the declines in memory and thinking. But Hasselmo says even small increases in this neurotransmitter can noticeably improve cognitive function. He says a cup of coffee boosts levels enough to improve attention and speed up reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HASSELMO: Changing things by 2.5% could have a pretty profound and notable effect even on a subjective level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Hasselmo says the first Alzheimer's drugs reduce symptoms by increasing acetylcholine. Now, he says, it looks like hardcore brain training can offer a similar benefit. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The body almost always sends early warnings, subtle signals that something deeper is brewing. The trick lies in noticing them and acting before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kunal Sood, MD, explained in a recent Instagram post that the lower body, our legs and feet, often provides early clues about heart, kidney, or circulatory problems. Yet, many people overlook these signs or dismiss them as normal fatigue or aging. Paying attention, he says, could make a critical difference to your long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Times feet can warn about dangerous diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in your lower limbs often signal what’s happening inside your heart, vessels, or circulation. Here’s what each clue can mean:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bulging, twisted veins&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are often varicose veins, dilated, twisted superficial veins caused by weakened valves and poor venous return. They appear as bluish or bulging lines along the legs or feet. According to the CEAP classification, visible, tortuous veins are a hallmark of C2-stage varicose vein disease.

Narrowed arteries restrict blood flow, making feet feel cool or look pale. Pain or cramping during walking, known as intermittent claudication, is a classic sign. Left unmanaged, PAD can progress to serious complications like non-healing wounds or tissue loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Calf red, hot, and swollen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A red, swollen, and warm calf can signal a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in a deep vein. Warning signs include one-sided tenderness, redness, and swelling due to venous obstruction. Risk factors include prolonged immobility, trauma, cancer, pregnancy, or inherited clotting disorders. Since DVT can lead to life-threatening pulmonary embolism, prompt medical attention is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sores on toes or ankles that don’t heal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-healing ulcers on the toes, feet, or ankles often stem from poor blood flow due to advanced PAD. Reduced circulation deprives tissues of oxygen, delaying healing and increasing infection risk. Such ulcers are red flags for severe vascular disease and, if untreated, can progress to gangrene or limb loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

Details on those flights aren’t typically shared with the public to maintain privacy of those who may be impacted, she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;If someone not vaccinated is exposed to a person contagious with the virus, symptoms could be expected between Oct. 20 and Nov. 3, the alert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, a rash that usually starts on the face and moves to chest and back, and red, watery eyes, according to the health department. The respiratory illness can be &lt;a href="https://health.alaska.gov/en/education/measles/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;dangerous or fatal&lt;/a&gt;, especially for babies or children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;People who think they have measles symptoms should call a health care provider before going to a hospital or clinic in-person, the alert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;As of Oct. 14, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention measles &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=Why%20are%20some%20fully%20vaccinated,have%20seen%20in%20previous%20years." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=Why%20are%20some%20fully%20vaccinated,have%20seen%20in%20previous%20years."&gt;tracking website&lt;/a&gt; said there have been three measles cases in Alaska in 2024 and 2025.

The cloudy area in her upper left chest lobe is from an oleothorax, a now obsolete procedure in which doctors would inject mineral oil into the space between the lungs to treat tuberculosis (TB) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/EM_RESUS/status/1977848357096747164"&gt;video posted on X&lt;/a&gt; this week reacting to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm1609176?query=featured_home"&gt;resurfaced case report&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally published in 2017, Dr Sam Ghali, an emergency medicine physician at the University of Florida Health in Jacksonville who was not involved in the case, said: 'This is an absolutely wild chest x-ray that you just don't see every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you think about this in 2025, it sounds absolutely crazy, but you have to imagine back then they didn't have anything else.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, TB infects a few thousands Americans every year and kills about 500, far fewer than cancer, heart disease and dementia. The threat is much more prevalent in developing countries, however, and TB kills 1.2million people worldwide each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB in the US was on a steady decline from 1993 until 2020, when the overall number of cases hit an all-time low of 7,170. But in 2021, that number jumped to 7,866.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prevalence has gone up every year since. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest CDC data shows the US provisionally recorded 10,347 TB cases in 2024 - up eight percent from the year before and the highest tally since 2011, when there were 10,471 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are now on the rise in 80 percent of US states, which experts have blamed missed cases and distrust of doctors forged by the Covid pandemic.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The demographics of TB have also shifted, starting in 2001. That was the first year the CDC reported more non-US born citizen patients than US-born, meaning immigrants and travelers were the driving force behind infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above are public health posters from the Work Projects Administration in the 1930s and '40s on getting tested for tuberculosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to the introduction of antibiotics, patients receiving an oleothorax would typically have the oil removed after they recovered from TB, though some patients, like the woman in the case report, lived with it for decades.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ghali said: 'The routine was that you would come back after a couple of years and get this removed, but a lot of patients, including our patient here, would just get lost to follow-up because they would never go back.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors in the late 19th and early 20th centuries typically recommended fresh air and rest to alleviate symptoms, typically in sanatoriums established specifically for TB patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early 1900s, Adirondack chairs were evented with wide armrests, tall slatted backs and higher seats in the front for patients in TB sanatoriums, as they were thought to help hold up patients' chests and help them get more fresh air, but they did not produce clinical benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB spreads through airborne droplets that are released into the air when a person with active TB coughs, sneezes or speaks. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, symptoms include a persistent and unexplained cough, sometimes coughing up blood or chest pain. Patients may also suffer from unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, patients may have severe breathing difficulties and extensive lung damage, and the infection may spread to other organs or the back, causing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths are most often due to respiratory failure caused by bacterial damage to the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis can be prevented with the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. Though, due to the generally low risk, it is not routinely offered in the US - except for to children regularly exposed to people with active TB or healthcare workers in areas with increased spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman in the case report had no complications from the oleothorax or TB.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ghali said: 'The human body is so amazing that she has adapted and lived with this for like 60 or 70 years, and this was just an incidental finding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's just such a powerful testament to the fact that medicine is hard... you've got to do the best with what you have to help people, and it's just so amazing how far we've come in medicine in just 75 years.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Among stimulants paired with fentanyl, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/drug-and-substance-abuse" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cocaine and methamphetamines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cocaine and methamphetamines&lt;/a&gt; were the most common, surpassing alcohol, heroin and benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seniors are especially susceptible to these overdoses, as many live with chronic &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health conditions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;health conditions&lt;/a&gt;, take several medications, and process drugs "more slowly due to age," the researchers stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a common misconception that opioid overdoses primarily affect younger people, according to Gab Pasia, lead study author and a medical student at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our analysis shows that older adults are also impacted by fentanyl-related deaths, and that stimulant involvement has become much more common in this group," he said in a statement. "This suggests that older adults are affected by the current fourth wave of the opioid crisis, following similar patterns seen in younger populations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Seniors are more vulnerable to overdoses, as many live with chronic health conditions, take several medications and process drugs more slowly, the researchers said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers could not determine the underlying reasons for these overdoses, as the analysis was a cross-sectional study on patterns over time, Pasia noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the findings underscore that fentanyl overdoses in older adults are often multi-substance deaths — not due to fentanyl alone — and the importance of sharing &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/drug-and-substance-abuse" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drug misuse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drug misuse&lt;/a&gt; prevention strategies to older patients," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors advised anesthesiologists and other &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/pain-management" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pain medicine&lt;/a&gt; specialists to recognize that polysubstance use can occur in all age groups, and to be cautious when prescribing opioids to adults over 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Richard Wang, M.D., an anesthesiology resident at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, added that older adults prescribed opioids, or their caregivers, should be informed about overdose prevention strategies, such as having naloxone available and knowing the signs of an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Doctors are encouraged to be cautious when prescribing opioids to senior patients.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk can also be reduced by simplifying medication routines, and using clear labeling and safe storage instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With these trends in mind, it is more important than ever to minimize opioid use in this vulnerable group and use other &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/pain-management" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pain control&lt;/a&gt; methods when appropriate," Wang said in the press release. "Proper patient education and regularly reviewing medication lists could help to flatten this terrible trend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Larissa K. Laskowski, an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emergency medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emergency medicine&lt;/a&gt; physician and medical toxicologist at NYU Langone Health, told Fox News Digital that the findings of this study are "not surprising," since illicit-made fentanyl is "one of the deadliest substances known to man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In recent years, it has proliferated throughout the illegal drug market," said Laskowski, who was not involved in the study. "Fentanyl is regularly found in supplies of cocaine and methamphetamine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laskowski, an educator in fentanyl risk at schools, stressed that everyone, not just seniors, should be aware of the drug's potential harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just a small amount (the equivalent of a few grains of salt) can stop breathing and cause overdose death," she warned. "Any substance that is sold illegally (not from a dispensary, pharmacy or licensed retail store) could have anything in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Health Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here For More Health Stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no quality control. Many drugs today are laced with fentanyl."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert reiterated that doctors should speak with patients and caregivers about reversal agents, like over-the-counter Narcan, which is often available for free at &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health departments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;health departments&lt;/a&gt;, clinics and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/deadly-drug-mix-drives-staggering-rise-overdose-deaths-among-seniors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Deadly drug mix drives staggering rise in overdose deaths among seniors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Deadly drug mix drives staggering rise in overdose deaths among seniors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 15:19:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBnYW5Idm9CQUo3ck0tdG1FcDJkS1NIRmNMYUpiclB0dV9VeVMyUG1nQW1DUGJRenNNT1NLb1I5NGJXSnlvcW85dDVUSjZlSEY5bUlzdGE4VU5yRDFkUU5BZEEyY3Z6YUlsZ2NXeWhBclBNcXJyVGlXNFRXdkw0dw</guid></item><item><title>这种流行的食用油可能会安静地破坏您的肠道健康- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/this-popular-cooking-oil-could-be-quietly-wrecking-your-gut-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 14:31:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQVEZhTlY2cG84WWNnRW9zT3U1eHp3XzJGUkE0ZjRMV2hFM3gzNF9JeDd3RjZNSlFqZmVEM29XMzU2VWhUOEJQc1JVU3NSSU03bjZuMEdZT1JERDhyVVNYaUxWSG9qY0RwbDJGbHFhNnl0NTNUTUNILTNSSnpmZkk5b2ozVmNxaTFxU3Q4LUZTcVdmTWhMa3NB</guid></item><item><title>退休人员花费的10项爱好比健身房会员更能延长寿命- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/z-t-10-hobbies-retirees-take-up-that-add-more-years-to-life-than-a-gym-membership-ever-could/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="92" data-end="214"&gt;When most people think about staying healthy in retirement, they picture gym memberships, protein shakes, and yoga mats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="216" data-end="352"&gt;But here’s the thing — longevity isn’t just built through reps and resistance bands. It’s built through joy, curiosity, and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="354" data-end="661"&gt;There’s a growing body of research showing that having meaningful hobbies can extend your life as much as, or even more than, structured exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="354" data-end="661"&gt;Why? Because hobbies give you a sense of purpose. They lower stress, strengthen social ties, and keep your brain flexible — all major predictors of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="663" data-end="716"&gt;Let’s take a look at ten of the most powerful ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="718" data-end="733"&gt;1) Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="735" data-end="827"&gt;If there’s one activity that consistently pops up in studies on longevity, it’s &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/r-psychology-says-people-who-stick-with-these-8-hobbies-usually-age-more-gracefully/"&gt;gardening hobby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="829" data-end="1039"&gt;It’s physical enough to keep you moving but gentle enough to sustain for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="829" data-end="1039"&gt;More importantly, it connects you with nature — something that so many people lose touch with after retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1041" data-end="1305"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10752423/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, gardening reduces stress hormones and lowers the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1041" data-end="1305"&gt;Plus, there’s that undeniable sense of satisfaction that comes from watching something grow because of your care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1307" data-end="1520"&gt;I started growing herbs during the pandemic — basil, thyme, mint — and I swear, clipping those leaves became a daily meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1307" data-end="1520"&gt;It’s hard to feel anxious when you’re surrounded by green things quietly thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1522" data-end="1540"&gt;2) Volunteering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1542" data-end="1613"&gt;Purpose is one of the strongest predictors of a longer, happier life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1615" data-end="1833"&gt;A long-term &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3804225/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Michigan found that retirees who volunteered regularly had a 40% lower risk of hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1615" data-end="1833"&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/k-you-know-youre-a-good-person-when-you-automatically-do-these-8-things-for-others-without-being-asked/"&gt;Helping others&lt;/a&gt; lights up the same reward centers in the brain as receiving a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1835" data-end="1968"&gt;But the best part? Volunteering keeps you socially connected — a factor researchers say rivals exercise when it comes to longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1970" data-end="2200"&gt;Whether it’s mentoring young people, delivering meals, or helping out at the local library, volunteering keeps your sense of relevance alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1970" data-end="2200"&gt;It reminds you that you still matter — not just to your family, but to your community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2202" data-end="2227"&gt;3) Painting or drawing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2229" data-end="2328"&gt;Creativity is deeply therapeutic. It reduces anxiety, improves focus, and encourages mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2330" data-end="2465"&gt;You don’t have to be Picasso to benefit, either. What matters is the &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/z-8-weirdly-specific-hobbies-psychologists-say-reduce-anxiety-better-than-mindfulness/"&gt;act of creating art&lt;/a&gt; — putting color, shape, and feeling onto a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2467" data-end="2662"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/news/archive/2016/june/art_hormone_levels_lower" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Drexel University found that making art lowers cortisol levels in just 45 minutes, regardless of skill level. That’s as effective as a brisk walk when it comes to stress reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2664" data-end="2859"&gt;Many retirees rediscover painting as a form of expression they never had time for during their working years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2664" data-end="2859"&gt;The canvas doesn’t judge deadlines or productivity. It’s simply a space to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2861" data-end="2896"&gt;4) Learning a musical instrument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2898" data-end="3013"&gt;There’s something magical about watching someone in their seventies pick up a guitar or piano for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3015" data-end="3248"&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/z-if-your-brain-wont-shut-off-at-night-these-8-slow-hobbies-might-change-everything/"&gt;Learning an instrument&lt;/a&gt; builds new neural pathways, improving memory and cognitive resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3015" data-end="3248"&gt;Researchers from Northwestern University have even &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2012/01/kraus-neural-timing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that musical training helps preserve hearing and speech comprehension as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3250" data-end="3446"&gt;I’ve seen this personally. My uncle, who took up drumming at 68, swears it keeps his mind sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3250" data-end="3446"&gt;He jokes that “coordinating four limbs should count as brain exercise,” and honestly, he’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3448" data-end="3569"&gt;Music engages emotion, focus, and rhythm — all while sparking joy. And unlike a treadmill, it never feels like a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3571" data-end="3590"&gt;5) Walking clubs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p data-start="3592" data-end="3643"&gt;Here’s the thing about walking — it’s underrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3645" data-end="3863"&gt;Walking itself is obviously great for your body, but walking with others is even better for your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3645" data-end="3863"&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/c-lc-if-retirement-feels-emptier-than-you-expected-these-7-hobbies-can-bring-meaning-back/"&gt;Joining a walking group&lt;/a&gt; or a hiking club combines light exercise with connection and conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3865" data-end="4086"&gt;A 2015 meta-analysis in The British Journal of Sports Medicine found that people who regularly joined &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/11/710" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; groups had improved blood pressure, cholesterol, and mental health — even more than those who walked alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4088" data-end="4275"&gt;I’ve joined a local weekend walking group myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4088" data-end="4275"&gt;The best part isn’t the distance we cover, but the stories swapped along the way. It turns an ordinary workout into a community ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4277" data-end="4295"&gt;6) Birdwatching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4297" data-end="4370"&gt;This might sound niche, but birdwatching is having a quiet renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4372" data-end="4554"&gt;It combines mindfulness, nature, and gentle movement — the trifecta of mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4372" data-end="4554"&gt;It also keeps your observational skills sharp, which is essential for cognitive longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4556" data-end="4810"&gt;Psychologists from the University of Exeter found that simply noticing &lt;a href="https://news-archive.exeter.ac.uk/featurednews/title_571299_en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt; and trees correlates with lower rates of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4556" data-end="4810"&gt;It’s not about counting species. It’s about attention — &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/n-5-things-i-do-for-my-mental-health-in-my-50s-that-i-didnt-do-in-my-30s/"&gt;learning to slow down&lt;/a&gt; and notice the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4812" data-end="4956"&gt;There’s a peace that comes from standing still and really looking. And for many retirees, that’s a new kind of productivity worth cultivating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4958" data-end="4971"&gt;7) Dancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4973" data-end="5038"&gt;Few hobbies deliver as many benefits in one package as dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5040" data-end="5309"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/z-if-you-can-still-do-these-8-movements-at-65-your-bodys-aging-far-better-than-you-think/"&gt;cardiovascular exercise&lt;/a&gt;, coordination training, and social bonding all in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5040" data-end="5309"&gt;&lt;a href="https://socialdance.stanford.edu/syllabi/smarter.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine found that dancing — especially social forms like salsa or ballroom — reduces dementia risk more than any other physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5311" data-end="5495"&gt;And here’s the beauty of it: dancing is playful. It brings laughter back into movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5311" data-end="5495"&gt;You’re not counting reps or tracking calories — you’re just moving to music and feeling alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5497" data-end="5658"&gt;One of my friends’ parents started tango lessons at 70 and said it “woke up” something inside them. That’s the real benefit — not just longevity, but vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5660" data-end="5688"&gt;8) Reading and book clubs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5690" data-end="5756"&gt;If exercise keeps the body young, reading keeps the brain sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5758" data-end="5937"&gt;Regular readers live longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5758" data-end="5937"&gt;That’s not a metaphor — a Yale &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5105607/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that people who read books for just 30 minutes a day lived nearly two years longer than those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5939" data-end="6194"&gt;But the key isn’t just reading alone. &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/r-7-low-stress-activities-that-help-introverts-expand-their-social-circle/"&gt;Joining a book club&lt;/a&gt; adds a layer of social and intellectual stimulation that supercharges those benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5939" data-end="6194"&gt;You’re not just consuming words — you’re discussing ideas, debating perspectives, and staying mentally agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6196" data-end="6449"&gt;I’m part of a small book club myself, and every time we meet, I’m reminded how energizing it is to talk with people who see the same story differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6196" data-end="6449"&gt;That exchange keeps the mind flexible — one of the biggest predictors of cognitive health in aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6451" data-end="6477"&gt;9) Cooking new cuisines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6479" data-end="6562"&gt;Cooking is both art and science — and for retirees, it’s also longevity medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6564" data-end="6824"&gt;Experimenting with new recipes, especially plant-forward ones, keeps the brain active through problem-solving, creativity, and sensory engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6564" data-end="6824"&gt;It’s also a great way to connect with others over shared meals, which boosts happiness and lowers inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6826" data-end="7018"&gt;Researchers from the Blue Zones project — which studies the world’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6125071/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;longest-living&lt;/a&gt; populations — note that shared, home-cooked meals are a key lifestyle factor across all longevity hotspots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7020" data-end="7173"&gt;Even &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/travel/z-if-youre-open-to-trying-local-cuisines-when-traveling-psychology-says-you-likely-have-these-7-rare-traits/"&gt;trying one new cuisine&lt;/a&gt; a month can transform your relationship with food. It’s not about fancy plating. It’s about curiosity and joy at the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7175" data-end="7204"&gt;10) Meditation and tai chi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7206" data-end="7348"&gt;Both meditation and tai chi fall into what psychologists call “embodied mindfulness” — a blend of awareness, breathing, and gentle movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7350" data-end="7559"&gt;These practices don’t just calm the mind; they recalibrate the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7350" data-end="7559"&gt;Harvard researchers have found that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3057175/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;regular meditation&lt;/a&gt; can lengthen telomeres — the protective caps on your DNA linked to aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7561" data-end="7772"&gt;Tai chi, meanwhile, improves balance, coordination, and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7561" data-end="7772"&gt;It’s also been shown to reduce fall risk by nearly 50% in older adults, according to a 2022 review in Frontiers in Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7774" data-end="7948"&gt;But beyond the research, these practices create something harder to measure — a kind of calm strength. The &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-7-signs-someone-will-be-successful-later-in-life-even-if-they-havent-achieved-much-yet/"&gt;ability to meet life’s changes&lt;/a&gt; with steadiness instead of stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7950" data-end="7981"&gt;That’s longevity at its core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7983" data-end="8001"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8003" data-end="8070"&gt;Longevity isn’t just about muscles or macros. It’s about meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8072" data-end="8200"&gt;The retirees who live the longest — and the fullest — tend to have something that keeps them curious, connected, and creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8202" data-end="8396"&gt;They’re the ones tending a garden, joining a dance class, or painting for the sheer joy of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8202" data-end="8396"&gt;They’re learning new instruments, spotting birds, cooking with friends, and walking with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8398" data-end="8534"&gt;These aren’t hobbies that chase fitness goals. They create them naturally — because they nurture joy, belonging, and mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8536" data-end="8633"&gt;If you’re planning for your later years, don’t just think about cardio. Think about connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8635" data-end="8707" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""&gt;The kind that makes your days longer not just in number, but in color.&lt;/p&gt;

Patterns emerge, questions arise, and the search for hidden connections begins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; has done exactly that – uncovering a remarkable geographic relationship between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two debilitating neurological conditions, long believed to be unrelated, now seem to share a powerful spatial link that could reshape how we think about their origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-geographic-pattern-for-als"&gt;Geographic pattern for ALS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Melissa Schilling, a professor at &lt;a href="https://www.nyu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt;’s Stern School of Business who specializes in analyzing large-scale datasets using econometrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results of the study are surprising because previous studies have typically concluded there was no evidence for a mechanistic or genetic link between the two diseases,” said Schilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By examining nationwide data, Schilling and her colleagues noticed overlapping geographic patterns for both ALS and MS&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for race, gender, wealth, latitude, and access to neurological healthcare, the correlation remained extremely high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that both diseases may share a hidden environmental or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/revolutionizing-cbd-treatment-for-epilepsy-and-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;social factor&lt;/a&gt; influencing where they occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-maps-make-patterns-clear"&gt;Heat maps make patterns clear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat maps from the research make the connection visible. According to the study, the patterns of ALS and MS line up across several regions, showing remarkable similarities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This visual evidence adds strength to the statistical findings. It indicates that certain regions face higher risks for both diseases, pointing to something deeper than coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, researchers focused mainly on biological and genetic causes of ALS and MS. This study, however, shifts attention toward geography – toward where people live and the shared features of those places. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research challenges scientists to look beyond the lab and consider the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/10/17062849/ALS_MS_geographical-connection_maps_Scientific-Reports_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/10/17062855/ALS_MS_geographical-connection_maps_Scientific-Reports_1s.jpg" alt="Source: CDC Wonder Database.

Credit: Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-deceptive-role-of-gender"&gt;The deceptive role of gender&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered why this link escaped detection for so long. The answer lies in a statistical quirk called Simpson’s paradox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon occurs when a trend appears within individual groups but vanishes or reverses when those groups are combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, gender played that deceptive role. When data were separated by gender, both sexes showed more than a 70 percent correlation between ALS and MS in their geographic distribution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet when combined, the trend disappeared because ALS tends to affect men more, while MS is more common among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery reveals how subtle data interactions can mask major &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-implant-tames-arthritis-by-tapping-the-bodys-own-nerve-signals/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; insights. Without separating the genders, the relationship between ALS and MS might have remained buried under misleading averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strong-geographic-pattern-for-als"&gt;Strong geographic pattern for ALS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have known that MS is more common in northern regions. Many linked this to sunlight exposure, UV radiation, and vitamin D levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers even tried treating patients with vitamin D or UV light, hoping to reduce symptoms or prevent disease. Yet results were inconsistent or minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study questions that long-standing theory. Instead, it shows that MS and ALS have a stronger geographic bond with each other than with latitude alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means both &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/a-century-of-progress-in-the-fight-against-cardiovascular-disease/"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; could share an environmental factor that varies across regions but not perfectly with latitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I started gathering and analyzing every dataset I could find relevant to ALS about nine years ago, when a friend with ALS asked me if I would take a look at the data,” said Schilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was very surprised to find such a strong geographic pattern as most of the research on ALS does not emphasize the role of geography. I was even more surprised to find that ALS has a very strong association with the geography of MS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-identifying-the-environmental-factors"&gt;Identifying the environmental factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Schilling, the finding is important because it suggests that an environmental factor likely plays a significant role in both diseases, and that could provide clues that help determine causes, prevention, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could that environmental factor be? The possibilities are wide-ranging. They include natural influences like viruses, parasites, algae, and molds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors may also involve human activities such as farming methods, mining, industrial pollution, and chemical contamination of fisheries. Even heating oil use could play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The list of suspects is long, but comparing across geographies and, in particular, across outlier locations, such as the Faroe Islands, where MS increased strikingly after military troops arrived there in the 1940s, could significantly narrow the hunt,” said Schilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights remind researchers that the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/traffic-noise-exposure-increases-mental-health-risks/"&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt; remains one of the least understood but most powerful influences on human health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying the right culprit among so many candidates will require careful, cross-regional comparisons and global cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-broad-analysis-strengthens-results"&gt;Broad analysis strengthens results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study extended beyond the United States. To ensure accuracy, Schilling’s team replicated the analysis worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers combined data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with global mortality statistics from the World Health Organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results remained consistent: ALS and MS share a strong geographic association across continents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such replication strengthens confidence in the finding. It suggests that this relationship is not unique to one country or culture but may reflect a universal environmental factor influencing both diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-connecting-geography-to-als"&gt;Connecting geography to ALS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries open a new chapter in the study of neurological disease. If environmental elements play a key role in both ALS and MS, then prevention strategies could one day become possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers might identify chemical exposures, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/if-pathogens-wish-to-spread-why-make-their-hosts-sick/"&gt;pathogens&lt;/a&gt;, or lifestyle factors contributing to disease patterns and reduce them before they cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By connecting geography to biology, this study challenges scientists to rethink old assumptions. It blends epidemiology, data science, and environmental research into a single compelling narrative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers continue to explore these patterns, they may not only understand these diseases better but also uncover new ways to protect future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the message is simple yet profound: the world we live in may shape our health in more ways than we ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-18755-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 12:36:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNT1ZjOXJtblZCa1RCTm13eEo4Tkl0R0RTcVByYVI3WDFHMEM0SE1odkY3ZWtkVHJXSUtVbzBGd0xySUk2WEpnY3VuY1cyT1owQWFpc2dJanpaeUg3ejdfWVVNa3c3YWI1eldsZWNEMU1WMUtQNXBtaWcyZnAyNThYenlJVHdWVjhvRDdzcWlfcWxEblFpUjFVSUJYVWxxenJIMVpBbEpnMjI</guid></item><item><title>根据新的研究，滚动肩膀对健康的惊人好处—以及为什么它感觉如此美好-汤姆指南</title><link>https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/the-surprising-health-benefit-of-rolling-your-shoulders-and-why-it-feels-so-good-according-to-new-research</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="5beabc9b-2387-4594-8ea4-24d26c2530b4"&gt;You know that little shoulder roll you do while sat at your desk to unhunch your posture or at the end of a stressful day? Turns out it might be doing more good for your body than you think. A recent &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12441015/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12441015/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that this simple 10-second stretch can lower blood pressure and switch on the body's 'relax' reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Minnesota Medical Center wanted to better understand what happens inside the body when we stretch our shoulders and upper back. Many of us instinctively roll our shoulders to ease tension, but the team suspected there might be more going on beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-b71c4e4c-65ca-4e8c-90d3-20c270463e84" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-the-study-shows-3"&gt;What the study shows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="2668c878-2950-4bc9-89c3-e1dce3b17ca4"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="a21bd171-66aa-44a4-aa03-27e6ed40cae1"&gt;To test their theory, they recruited 24 adults and asked them to hold a simple stretch. Participants sat in a chair, lifted their shoulders toward their ears, leaned back slightly and held that position for 10 to 15 seconds. During the movement, the research team closely monitored their heart rate and blood pressure to track how the body responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6c6deb65-1cda-41b9-a5b0-8486fb7a2cc1"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple shoulder roll may do more than just loosen up stiff muscles. It appears to signal your body to slow down, relax and restore balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="62baba47-318e-4040-a0cb-5fc63ceb3ecd-0"&gt;The effect was almost immediate. Blood pressure dropped noticeably during the stretch, and unlike other situations where the heart speeds up to counteract that drop, the increase in heart rate was much more limited. This unusual combination suggested a reflex response in the nervous system, one that likely activates the body’s natural relaxation mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In everyday terms, this means that a simple shoulder roll may do more than just loosen up stiff muscles. It appears to signal your body to slow down, relax and restore balance, which may help explain why this movement feels so good in the moment. The researchers believe this response starts in the muscles and travels through the nervous system, creating a calming effect that you can actually feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-what-are-other-small-habits-that-can-help-lower-blood-pressure" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-are-other-small-habits-that-can-help-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are other small habits that can help lower blood pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="b510d962-7812-4120-8978-2ad6de1149b2"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="44c70b5f-72d9-42d9-b661-15c88b3b1d75"&gt;Shoulder rolls aren’t the only easy way to support cardiovascular health. Research has shown that everyday habits, especially those that help calm the nervous system, can make a meaningful difference.

More than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;10 million new cases&lt;/a&gt; of dementia are recorded worldwide each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a study published in 2024 suggests as many as 13 percent of people diagnosed with dementia in the US may actually be misdiagnosed and left struggling with a condition that can be treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Health care providers [must be] made aware of this potential overlap between dementia and hepatic encephalopathy, which is treatable," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/13-percent-of-patients-with-dementia-may-instead-have-cognitive-decline-from-cirrhosis"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Virginia Commonwealth University hepatologist Jasmohan Bajaj in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/millions-of-us-have-likely-lost-our-smell-without-even-realizing-it"&gt;Millions of Us Have Likely Lost Our Smell Without Even Realizing It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy"&gt;Hepatic encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; – cognitive impairment caused by liver failure – affects more than 40 percent of patients with advanced liver disease (&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351487"&gt;cirrhosis&lt;/a&gt;). The brain impairments it causes are hard to distinguish from dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/liver-anatomy-and-functions"&gt;Our livers regulate&lt;/a&gt; the levels of most chemicals in our bodies, from filtering them from the blood to aiding digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-what-happens-to-your-liver-when-you-quit-alcohol"&gt;alcohol's well-known harms&lt;/a&gt;, other risks to the liver include the hepatitis  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="178109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, high cholesterol, obesity and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="178109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, stress, and aging. But if caught early enough and with the right treatment, damage to our livers can be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this can be mitigated through changes in diet and behavior, and there are even more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-024-00652-w"&gt;potential drug treatments&lt;/a&gt; on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg" alt="An older woman with grey hair and glasses, talking on the phone" class="size-full wp-image-145448" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Up to 13 percent of people diagnosed with dementia in the US may have a misdiagnosis.

&lt;li&gt;One in four adults have “hidden” belly-fat obesity despite a normal BMI.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Older adults and Asian participants saw the biggest increase in obesity classification.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The new definition could change who qualifies for treatment and reshape healthcare policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOSTON —&lt;/strong&gt; A revolutionary change in how doctors define obesity could fundamentally reshape medical practice, according to research analyzing health data from over 300,000 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists found that adopting a new obesity framework endorsed by 76 professional medical organizations increased &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity rates&lt;/a&gt; from 42.9% to 68.6% among study participants. This dramatic jump stems from including people who have dangerous &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/obesity-belly-fat-prostate-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt; despite maintaining what doctors previously considered a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-025-01542-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the study analyzed data from the All of Us research program and represents the first large-scale examination of how &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/obesity-redefined-why-doctors-are-ditching-bmi-for-these-key-health-markers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;new obesity guidelines&lt;/a&gt; would affect healthcare. The research tracked participants for four years to document real health outcomes, not just theoretical classifications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-the-scale-why-waist-size-matters"&gt;Beyond the Scale: Why Waist Size Matters&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying solely on the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/bmi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;height-to-weight calculation&lt;/a&gt; that has dominated medicine for decades, the new approach incorporates waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio alongside BMI to create a more complete health assessment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by endocrinologist Dr. Lindsay Fourman from Massachusetts General Hospital, found that traditional BMI measurements miss many people with dangerous fat distribution patterns. The research team found that belly fat, regardless of overall weight, serves as a key predictor of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/exercising-belly-fat-healthier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists identified a category called “anthropometric-only obesity” affecting 78,047 study participants. These individuals maintain normal BMI scores while carrying elevated measurements around their midsection. Among this group, 17,426 people (22.3%) had BMI scores doctors previously labeled as normal or underweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;BMI measurements don’t tell the whole story for some people who have higher levels of dangerous belly fat.(kwanchai.c/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-risks-that-bmi-misses"&gt;Health Risks That BMI Misses&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked participants to document who developed serious health problems. People with this hidden form of obesity faced significantly higher risks than those without obesity, despite looking healthy on standard scales.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared to people without obesity, those with the waist-centered type were 76% more likely to have organ problems. They also faced more than double the risk of developing diabetes and 55% higher risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;he research team found that people with this form of obesity often developed &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, physical limitations, and sleep apnea. These conditions typically emerge gradually, making early identification through waist measurements potentially valuable for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-age-and-demographics-drive-changes"&gt;Age and Demographics Drive Changes&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study revealed striking patterns across different groups. Among participants aged 18 to 29, obesity prevalence under the new definition reached 43.9%. The most dramatic change occurred among seniors: 78.3% of Americans over 70 in the study met criteria for obesity under the new framework, compared to previous BMI-based classifications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This age-related increase reflects how body composition changes over time, with fat increasingly accumulating &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/bigger-belly-weaker-memory-cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;around the midsection&lt;/a&gt; as people get older. Among people over 70 in the study, 54.4% had what researchers called “clinical obesity” indicating the presence of organ dysfunction or physical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research also found notable differences by race and gender. Asian participants saw the largest relative increase in obesity rates, jumping 90.3% from 2,439 participants (27.0%) to 4,641 participants (51.4%) under the new definition. Male participants were more likely than female participants to have anthropometric-only obesity, affecting 32.5% of men versus 21.7% of women in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-obesity-treatment-guidelines-face-major-overhaul"&gt;Obesity Treatment Guidelines Face Major Overhaul&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new framework could dramatically alter who receives obesity medications and treatments. Currently, 44.7% of study participants qualified for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/ozempic-anti-obesity-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-obesity drugs&lt;/a&gt; based on BMI guidelines. Under the new framework, about half of those who currently qualify for weight-loss medication (51.2%) would be reclassified as having preclinical obesity or no obesity, suggesting they may receive lower priority for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, among participants with clinical obesity under the new definition (excluding those with diabetes already eligible for certain medications), 15,495 of 69,894 (22.2%) wouldn’t meet current eligibility criteria for recent weight-loss drug trials or FDA-approved medications. This mismatch indicates treatment guidelines may need substantial revision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Lancet Commission that developed the new definition recommends pharmacological treatment for all people with clinical obesity and select individuals with preclinical obesity. This represents a shift from current practice toward more targeted treatment based on health complications rather than BMI alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clinical-vs-preclinical-obesity"&gt;Clinical vs. Preclinical Obesity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new approach introduces two categories. “Clinical obesity” means someone has health problems or physical limitations related to their weight. “Preclinical obesity” means early warning signs are present but serious symptoms haven’t developed yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 36% of all study participants had clinical obesity, with rates climbing sharply with age. The distinction matters because people with clinical obesity faced the highest risks of future diabetes, heart disease, and death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the earlier stage carried meaningful health risks. People with preclinical obesity had more than three times the risk of developing diabetes and 40% higher risk of heart problems compared to those without obesity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study tracked the most common health problems associated with clinical obesity: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; topped the list, followed by physical limitations and sleep apnea. The research revealed that organ dysfunction itself, even without obesity, significantly increased health risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For healthcare systems and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/when-health-insurance-makes-medicine-more-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insurance companies&lt;/a&gt;, these changes could carry massive financial consequences. Medicare and other payers may need to reassess coverage policies as the eligible population for obesity treatments potentially shifts substantially.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We already thought we had an obesity epidemic, but this is astounding,” Dr. Fourman said in a statement. “With potentially 70 percent of the adult population now considered to have excess fat, we need to better understand what treatment approaches to prioritize.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors acknowledge that implementing the new definition would require more work and resources than current BMI-based screening. However, they argue that the improved ability to identify health risks may justify the additional effort, particularly if integrated into electronic health record systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity prevalence&lt;/a&gt; using traditional BMI-based criteria (42.9%) closely aligns with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates for the US population (40.3%), supporting the potential broader applicability of these findings to American adults generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 301,026 adults in the All of Us research program, enrolled between May 2017 and September 2023. Participants underwent standardized measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference, and completed health surveys. The study used electronic health records to track health outcomes over a median follow-up period of 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the new obesity definition, 68.6% of participants met criteria for obesity compared to 42.9% using traditional BMI-based criteria. The increase was driven by including 78,047 people with “anthropometric-only obesity” who had elevated waist measurements despite normal BMI. Clinical obesity affected 36.1% of all participants. People with anthropometric-only obesity had odds ratios of 1.76 for organ dysfunction and adjusted hazard ratios of 2.12 for diabetes and 1.55 for cardiovascular events compared to those without obesity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study relied on diagnostic codes, surveys, and laboratory results to classify clinical obesity, which may not fully capture all cases of organ dysfunction. Researchers could not establish whether organ dysfunction was directly caused by obesity. The analysis used the new framework’s ability to predict future health risks as a measure of clinical utility, rather than a gold standard comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

However, there is added concern in parts of Latin America over unequal access to healthcare and the worrying situation in the US, which is facing its worst measles outbreak in decades following &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/09/cdc-separate-mmr-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a reversal of vaccine policy&lt;/a&gt; led by Donald Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The US’s political position in relation to health and vaccination is an outrage,” said Rosana Richtmann, an infectious disease doctor and coordinator of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Disease’s immunisation committee. “It’s a problem for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d453025d-7267-40b3-b3b8-de34e16300c0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;People queue for vaccination at a Ciudad Juárez shopping centre near the US border.

We’re not just talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/hpv-vaccines-and-cervical-cancer-prevention-where-are-we-now-77796" target="_blank"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, incredible though its success has been at &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/cervical-cancer-cases-fall-by-almost-90-percent-in-hpvvaccinated-generation-61511" target="_blank"&gt;preventing cases of cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;. A vaccine against a virus, albeit one that causes cancer, is easier to conceptualize – we get vaccinated against tons of other viruses, after all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccinating against a non-infectious disease like &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/could-we-be-on-track-towards-a-universal-cancer-vaccine-new-findings-say-maybe-80085" target="_blank"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, with all its complex causes and different presentations, is much harder to wrap your head around – making this latest study perhaps even more impressive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have developed a nanoparticle-based vaccine that has &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adj9366" target="_blank"&gt;previously been shown&lt;/a&gt; to shrink and clear cancerous tumors in mice. Now, they’ve demonstrated it can also work to prevent three types of cancer: pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and triple-negative breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the type of vaccine, you need two key components: something to kick the immune system into gear, called the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/rfk-jr-wanted-a-journal-to-retract-this-massive-study-on-aluminum-in-vaccines-it-refused-80428" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;adjuvant&lt;/a&gt;, and the thing that you want the immune system to respond to, called the antigen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/key-facts-about-the-seasonal-flu-vaccine-what-to-know-as-winter-approaches-80948" target="_blank"&gt;flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, you would include parts of inactivated flu viruses. The &lt;a href="http://www.iflscience.com/tags/COVID-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; worked slightly differently, containing genetic instructions for the body to temporarily make its own copies of the virus’s spike protein for the immune system to react to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tried their nanoparticle vaccine with a few different cancer antigens; but crucially, it is also set apart by its “super-adjuvant”, which has been formulated to provoke different types of immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team first tested the nanoparticle platform with a well-characterized &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/skin-moles-what-are-they-and-when-should-you-get-them-checked-79758" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; antigen, before exposing the mice three weeks later to melanoma cells. All of the unvaccinated or control vaccinated mice succumbed to cancer within 35 days. By contrast, 80 percent of those vaccinated with the new system remained tumor free until the end of the study (250 days).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeating the test for other cancer types, the team used tumor lysate – killed cancer cells extracted from an active tumor – as the antigen. As before, the mice were subsequently exposed to melanoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or triple-negative breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the majority of the vaccinated mice did not develop tumors: 88 percent for pancreatic cancer, 75 percent for breast cancer, and 69 percent for melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By engineering these nanoparticles to activate the immune system via multi-pathway activation that combines with cancer-specific antigens, we can prevent tumor growth with remarkable survival rates,” said corresponding author Prabhani Atukorale in a &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherst-researchers-create-nanoparticle-vaccine-prevents-cancer-mice" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Griffin Kane added, “The tumor-specific T-cell responses that we are able to generate – that is really the key behind the survival benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s all down to the “super-adjuvant”. Essentially, the team found a way to engineer their &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/nanoparticle-vaccine-could-protect-against-future-covid-19-variants-plus-other-coronaviruses-77878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;nanoparticles&lt;/a&gt; to deliver two adjuvants at once, as well as the antigen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is really intense immune activation when you treat innate immune cells with this formulation, which triggers these cells to present antigens and prime tumor-killing T cells,” Kane explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In recent years, we have come to understand how important the selection of the adjuvant is because it drives the second signal that is needed for the correct priming of T and B cells,” said Atukorale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sq-1BdsMkYc" title="How Jane C. Wright Revolutionized Cancer Therapy" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as preventing tumors from forming, the type of immunity induced by this vaccine also shows promise in stopping &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-might-this-cheap-painkiller-be-able-to-stop-some-cancers-from-spreading-78398" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;metastasis&lt;/a&gt; – the way cancers spread to different regions in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Metastases across the board is the highest hurdle for cancer. The vast majority of tumor mortality is still due to metastases, and it almost trumps us working in difficult-to-reach cancers, such as melanoma and pancreatic cancer,” said Atukorale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the super-adjuvanted vaccines, she explained, you can achieve “memory immunity”. “We have memory systemically, which is very important. The immune system spans the entire geography of the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team are hopeful that their platform can now be further developed to produced preventative and therapeutic vaccines for multiple different types of cancer, work that has already begun with the founding of a startup called NanoVax Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a platform that Prabhani developed,” said Kane. “The startup lets us pursue these translational efforts with the ultimate goal of improving patients’ lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00488-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666379125004884%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#sec-2" target="_blank"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 10:07:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQc2NTSTVXck82dXhkZl9IQnE2T2E2T3Mxb0E1dy1rU0JHdHB4NDJfVjVLUTJRazR4cHVGcWthU2pqR2loUUYzc2JROEc1VG1hUVFVbVVaLWZzdG8tZnBpWXVjNFl6cmMyMTFLM1FhemwwdmtUY2Jfam1tTEYzelgzZ01xME5sNUZlTmdEUjNfMzI5ZGkzOUxuTDJ3SklydWZrOWxTNktLSEFQWFZscEw4blYwSk1ZOTRYQjJLaXVnenhISGhVZk5oNg</guid></item><item><title>这种激素状况影响着数百万女性，但往往被误诊--《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/17/pcos-misdiagnosis-treatment-symptoms/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UVLRGIHHCNEPVNKVW73JFZO4AM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scrolling through Instagram on her lunch break, Alexis King came across video of model and actress Lori Harvey talking about how long it took for doctors to finally diagnose her with what turned out to be one of the most common hormone conditions among women of reproductive age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 10:01:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPZFJMUHNRNklUa3h5X3ZOYzdNYnloZlU2eG1FMnRjdUFLTjA2ODJIdXhmZDhXRXU3dkZSdlRjMjloUFhXa09jVlZMVFJZNm1FNnRGSGJpRHhrVTB2UW5oV3g4R05VMGFKNlIySU5lQk56WGtpSllXTGhQQU0wOExzZmRDdFlIOEhtMENGRVNkZw</guid></item><item><title>与对镜像生命末日风险敲响警钟的科学家见面- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/science/mirror-cell-life-dangers</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtk4u0t000x26p9e9ia5bwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientist Kate Adamala doesn’t remember exactly when she realized her lab at the University of Minnesota was working on something potentially dangerous — so dangerous in fact that some researchers think it could pose an existential&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;risk to all life forms on Earth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000c356n21wv5ghk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She was one of four researchers awarded a $4 million &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/researchers-handed-4m-to-boot-up-mirror-cell-synthesis" target="_blank"&gt;US National Science Foundation grant&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 to investigate whether it’s possible to produce a mirror cell,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in which the structure of all of its component biomolecules is the reverse of what’s found in normal cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000d356nya8h88qp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The work was important, they thought, because such reversed cells, which have never existed in nature, could shed light on the origins of life and make it easier to create molecules with therapeutic value, potentially tackling significant medical challenges such as &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mirror-life/mirror-life" target="_blank"&gt;infectious disease and superbugs&lt;/a&gt;. But doubt crept in.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000e356nhvcgdb8g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was never one light bulb moment. It was kind of a slow boiling over a few months,” Adamala, a synthetic biologist, said. People started asking questions, she added, “and we thought we can answer them, and then we realized we cannot.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000f356nbo7jwacm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The questions hinged on what would happen if scientists succeeded in making a “mirror organism” such as a bacterium from molecules that are the mirror images of their natural forms. Could it inadvertently spread unchecked in the body or an environment, posing grave risks to human health and dire consequences for the planet? Or would it merely fizzle out and harmlessly disappear without a trace?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000g356nxvs08qvz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In nature, the structure of many major biomolecules is right- or left-handed, although it’s not clear why life evolved this way. It’s a property known as chirality that was first discovered by French scientist Louis Pasteur in 1848. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;For example, DNA and RNA are made from “right-handed” nucleotides, and proteins are made from “left-handed” amino acids. Just as a right-handed glove cannot fit a left hand or how a key precisely fits a lock, interactions between molecules often depend on chirality, and living systems need consistent patterns of chirality to function properly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkbfzg000h356nv1vn418c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a mirror cell, all its molecules would be replaced with mirror-image versions.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Such a development is hypothetical; even creating a synthetic cell with natural chirality that mimics its normal living counterparts  isn’t yet possible, but it’s an active and exciting area of research that Adamala and several other research groups are pursuing. Scientists can make many of the components from non-living precursors, and they could soon engineer normal synthetic cells, which in theory could then create single-cell life forms, such as bacteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtk500o0000356nv1hkh90r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By themselves, small mirror molecules do not pose any particular risks, and scientists can already safely make proteins and carbohydrates with opposite chirality, which hold pharmaceutical promise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000o356n5hsjj4jh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Complete mirror cells, however, remain out of reach. Adamala and her colleagues didn’t make much progress with their investigations on that front. The Covid-19 pandemic meant that the research was slow to get off the ground and, more crucially, informal conversations Adamala had with colleagues in other fields, at conferences and other forums, began to sow alarm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000p356nn8lbj9v4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People that are experts in biosafety, immunology and ecology, they didn’t think that something like a mirror cell was actually likely, they thought it science fiction,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000q356n0jwj7uv4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One thing these other scientists brought up that was extremely surprising to her was that “mirror cells would likely be completely invisible to the human immune system,” Adamala added. “I used to think the immune system will find a way to detect any invading biomolecules. I didn’t know how chiral the immune system was.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000r356nzm8d5d2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the course of 2023 and 2024, those ad-hoc conversations coalesced into a working group of 38 scientists, including Adamala, and in December 2024 the group published a bombshell article in the high-profile scientific journal Science titled &lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2024/12/16/science/mirror-bacteria-research-risks"&gt;“Confronting Risks of Mirror Life,”&lt;/a&gt; which summarized the findings of a detailed 300-page report compiled by the same group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000s356nmuerskem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/cv716pj4036" target="_blank"&gt;The report concluded&lt;/a&gt; that mirror cells could become a reality in the next 10 to 30 years and detailed the potentially devasting consequences if mirror bacteria were released into an environment and spread, evading natural biological controls and acting as dangerous pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg408000t356nhenaxd1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since then, a nonprofit called &lt;a href="https://www.mbdialogues.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Mirror Biology Dialogues Fund&lt;/a&gt; has sponsored a series of meetings to develop recommendations aimed at averting the threat scientists think mirror life could pose. While there’s broad agreement that mirror organisms such as bacteria should not be created, there’s much debate over what — if any — limits to investigating mirror biology should exist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkg20x000m356nszuj65ge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dozens of experts met at a two-day conference on engineering and safeguarding synthetic life in Manchester, UK, in September to discuss where red lines should be drawn to restrict research into technologies that could enable the creation of mirror organisms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs000z356nmrn32jrr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is the possibility that, with admittedly a great deal of work, we could create something which could grow inexorably, spread across the planet and displace or kill many, many forms of life, including us, the animals around us, the plants around us, and even some of the microbes,” said David Relman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, who attended the meeting at the University of Manchester’s Institute of Biotechnology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtn85id002k356nrie7q2h2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Relman, like Adamala, was one of the early members of the working group and remembered keeping initial conversations under wraps. “We didn’t want to be unduly alarmist. We also didn’t want to sound like crackpots,” he recalled. “I think we all hoped that we would quickly learn there was some fatal flaw in this logic, but it started to bother me enough to wake me up at night.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0011356n7upetslm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their alarm stemmed from the fact that, because natural life is chiral, interactions between natural organisms and mirror bacteria would be profoundly unpredictable. While the first mirror bacterium would likely be extremely fragile, limiting its growth and survival, it could persist, given the right nutrients. Ultimately, it might act like an invasive species, disrupting ecosystems without predators to keep it in check.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0012356nq1kjgo7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Relman said mirror bacteria could potentially evade critical parts of plant, animal and human immune systems, which would have difficulty detecting or killing them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0014356npk75jgwb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once inside a human, a mirror bacteria could hypothetically replicate to extremely high levels in the body, causing its host to experience something similar to septic shock. Potential medical countermeasures — including most antibiotics — are chiral, meaning they likely would not be effective on mirror bacteria, although it is possible that mirror versions of antibiotics could be produced.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0015356nj4enme5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And while biocontainment measures, such as those scientists use to work with dangerous pathogens, could theoretically prevent mirror bacteria from leaving a lab, those measures would be vulnerable to human error or deliberate misuse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0016356nvv05rekj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While such a doomsday scenario is far from a sure thing, and there’s great uncertainty about the risks mirror life would pose given it doesn’t yet exist, no one has been able to totally refute the risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0017356n76kuwb0l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At first, people were questioning whether those concerns are actually as serious as we thought they were. And so we were trying to poke holes in it, trying to find ways in which we were wrong,” Adamala said. “The more we looked, the more we were certain, and more people were coming on board to this idea that there actually is no safe way to make a mirror cell.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0018356nmnz87xyw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Relman characterized mirror life as the first plausible existential risk he had encountered in a long career that has included investigating the&lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2024/05/05/us/how-it-really-happened-anthrax-attacks"&gt; 2001 deadly anthrax letters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/new-evidence-havana-syndrome"&gt;Havana Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious health ailment that has impacted spies, soldiers and diplomats around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkgprs0019356ngqk2i1t8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said what gives him cause for optimism is the fact that, unlike other contentious and risky areas of science such as cloning, mirror life doesn’t exist yet — it isn’t a “here and now thing” that would be harder to stop. “There’s a real chance we don’t have to have this happen to us unless we choose to do so.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001g356n78drtwti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts involved in the mirror life discussions in Manchester, however, said it is important to tread cautiously and not make kneejerk decisions that could thwart scientific progress. They emphasized that research to develop individual mirror molecules should be distinguished from that to develop mirror cells or organisms — even though both are sometimes termed mirror life or biology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001h356nnz79w3d7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Michael Kay, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Utah who is focused on developing drugs — primarily against infectious diseases like HIV — based on mirror-image molecules, said he isn’t “so supportive” of red lines that would completely block an area of study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001i356nqp7n27vb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I feel like they’re too blunt of a tool,” Kay noted, referring to blanket regulations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001j356nrghg08ky@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the human body doesn’t recognize them as readily, mirror molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids resist degradation and are more stable there — useful traits for potential therapeutic drugs. And since mirror proteins cannot self-replicate, they do not pose the same risks as a mirror cell. However, Kay is worried that through unclear messaging, the word “mirror” will become automatically equated with risky research and it will limit innovation in this area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001k356n2pfj3773@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Mirror molecules are inert chemicals with tremendous benefits,” he explained. “This is very early (research), but they’re here and there’s many more in clinical trials. In the next five or 10 years, this is going to be a big class of drugs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001l356n504k1429@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also noted that the risks of mirror cells or organisms, should they be unleashed, are unknown. “This (organism) could just starve to death, which we think is probably the most likely thing, or consume all the resources in the Earth and compete with all existing life,” Kay said. “That’s a huge range.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001m356nt0j0rqzp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, he said the ongoing attempts to weigh the risks are important: “I think any effort that buys us time to better understand and better consider the risks and to, you know, just be more deliberate in the way the technologies are advanced, rather than just having a free for all, I think that’s beneficial. And we have the time, you know, for that to happen,” Kay added. “This is not imminent.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001o356np0he3n74@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many synthetic biologists, including Adamala, are seeking to make a synthetic cell — with natural chirality — from scratch out of non-living parts. The aim is to create something that mimics biological processes to shed light on the cascade of biochemical reactions that allowed life to first arise hundreds of millions of years ago and help solve problems in medicine, industry, the environment and basic research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001p356n3ofoksni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A synthetic cell would be like operating system for life: it would let us engineer biology at unprecedented scale, with precision that we can’t get in natural cells,” Adamala explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001q356n8ogwzm4s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We will build models of cellular processes, both healthy and diseases, to understand how healthy cells can be made to work better and how diseases start,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001r356nhgj9ujg3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s possible that scientists will hit that milestone of a synthetic non-mirror cell soon, perhaps within a year, according to John Glass, a professor and leader of the La Jolla, California-based J. Craig Venter Institute’s Synthetic Biology Group. And if a normal cell with natural chirality can be created from lifeless molecules, then, in theory, he said a mirror-image cell could be created from mirror-image molecules using the same methods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001s356nrik42meb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Glass’ initial conversations with Relman in April 2024 about the potential risks of mirror life left him “shaken,” he remembered. “It made me wonder if the thing, the work that I have been doing for years, could be enabling, one day, the mirror bacteria-based Armageddon that we fear,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001t356nbqj40p1l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, most experts agree that making a synthetic cell with natural chirality is safe, because if a  bacterium made from a synthetic cell were to enter an environment, it would be subject to the normal controls of any ecosystem, making it easy prey to natural predators such as viruses that target bacteria. Thus, it wouldn’t be able to spread uncontrollably.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001u356ngmnrzd2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Glass, an obvious red line is for scientists to refrain from making a mirror ribosome, a biological machine found in a cell’s cytoplasm that makes proteins. While that advance would  still be far from creating a mirror cell, he said if you instead draw the line at the last step — creating a mirror membrane and then assembling all the constituent parts — it’s too late.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001v356n5skzoscj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Kay at the University of Utah feels differently. His lab is focused on improving the chemical synthesis of mirror proteins, a process which is currently very inefficient. As an alternative, he is interested in exploring making a mirror image ribosome.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001w356nso4h5p50@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The idea is that if we could make a mirror ribosome, we could then use that to make these products with much higher quality, much longer proteins, in a way that might be compatible with pharmaceutical use,” Kay explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001x356npuumlga0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But there is concern, in this group — and I’m undecided right now — whether having that would be such a valuable tool that it would make the development of mirror life inevitable or too easy for others,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy37001z356nmzheoyaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adamala, along with her colleagues, chose not to renew her research grant, ending her lab’s work on mirror cells. She is focusing instead on discussions around how to regulate mirror life research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370020356nf7wkqeip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To the best of her knowledge, she said, no scientists are pursuing the creation of a mirror cell. In February 2025, nearly 100 researchers, funders and policymakers &lt;a href="https://repository.rice.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/03831782-2fe2-4b00-82ef-781e9c8a0353/content" target="_blank"&gt;signed an entreaty&lt;/a&gt; arguing that “mirror life should not be created unless future research convincingly demonstrates that it would not pose severe risks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370021356n2oafbfag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, signatures and self-restraint may be not enough. Adamala, Glass and Relman all said they hope their conversations will inform more formal restrictions or policies at international or national level.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370022356nczk9mr9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was no concrete outcome from the Manchester meeting, and related discussions continued at a September workshop hosted by &lt;a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/mirror-image-biology-pushing-the-envelope-in-designing-biological-systems-a-workshop" target="_blank"&gt;National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s&lt;/a&gt; Standing Committee on Advances and National Security Implications of Transdisciplinary Biotechnology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370023356nu5q61ltv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Pretty much everyone agrees that we should not make a living mirror cell. That’s the baseline but below that people have a lot of different ideas where should we stop the research,” Adamala said. “Right now, the scientific community can’t really agree on the red lines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370024356nlsk3f3vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Relman said the goal is that the proactive efforts the group is making will not only protect the planet from a doomsday scenario but could help rebuild some of the trust scientists have lost with the public in recent years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgtkhy370025356nxa4za4a1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Wouldn’t it be great if we could be the Dr. Ian Malcolm of ‘Jurassic Park’?” he said, referring to the fictional mathematician played by Jeff Goldblum in the 1993 movie, who warns other characters about the potential dangers of unbridled scientific ambition. “We scientists … think about whether we should, not whether we could.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world, with 1.3 million people living with the condition, according to &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/zimbabwe" title="External link — figures"&gt;figures&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from UNAIDS, the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/united-nations-un/t-17440154"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; program on &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/hiv-aids/t-18932088"&gt;HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The southern African nation recently met the UNAIDS 95–95-95 fast-track targets, meaning that 95% of those living with HIV know their status; 95% of those who know they have HIV are on life-saving antiretroviral treatment; and 95% of people on treatment achieve viral suppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-teams="true"&gt;Ponesai Nyika, a public health expert with extensive experience in HIV/AIDS research and program implementation, told DW that Zimbabwe has a "very solid HIV response infrastructure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of lenacapavir is expected to greatly boost Zimbabwe's efforts to eradicate infections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is lenacapavir considered a game changer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/world-health-organization-who/t-38396203"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; has hailed lenacapavir as a &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-07-2025-who-recommends-injectable-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention" title="External link — transformative step forward"&gt;transformative step forward&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in protecting people at risk of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While an HIV vaccine remains elusive, lenacapavir is the next best thing: a long-acting antiretroviral shown in trials to prevent almost all HIV infections among those at risk," said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNAIDS has also described the drug as a watershed moment in HIV response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are talking about it as a potential &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/miracle-hiv-drug-lenacapavir-approved-amid-drastic-us-health-budget-cuts/a-73023089"&gt;miracle drug&lt;/a&gt;," Angeli Achrekar, deputy director of UNAIDS, told DW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Right now, the fact that it is nearly 100% effective at stopping new infections is remarkable, it's unprecedented. It's the best thing we've got in the HIV response. We do not have a vaccine or cure, but this is extraordinary."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir is expected to be rolled out across 120 low- and middle-income countries by 2027 and is anticipated to significantly reduce the 1.3 million new HIV/AIDS infections yearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nyika told DW that the drug is seen to be "highly effective."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Specifically for HIV prevention, it has been seen to be highly effective, which is what makes it very exciting compared to the others. It is highly effective in preventing HIV infections if used correctly and consistently," Nyika said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drug has gone through two trials: One in sub-Saharan Africa among women and girls, the other among American &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/lgbtq-rights/t-17455109"&gt;gay and bisexual men and transgender women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both trials, the efficacy of the drug was more than 99%, raising hope for its "extraordinary" abilities in HIV prevention once fully available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nyika further explained that the administration of the drug only twice a year makes it even more effective as it reduces incidents of low adherence to HIV treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mixed reactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some Zimbabweans are upbeat about the introduction of the medication, others are more skeptical about the drug's cost, safety and accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Nyika argues that while lenacapavir — like every new medication — can have some side effects, "the data that we have does show that lenacapavir is very safe and well tolerated."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He urged African countries rolling out the drug to be transparent and communicate clearly about any side effects of the drug to aid in its adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant praise for the drug, its cost also raises key questions about how accessible this "miracle drug" can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"How is it going to help us? Because I'm sure it's for the rich," a Ugandan citizen told DW, reacting to the $40-dollar yearly cost of the drug, which was initially projected to cost about $28,000 (€24,197) per person annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lenacapavir prevention regimen also requires an initial oral dose when starting the regimen: two tablets to be taken on the day of the first injection and two tablets to be taken on the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address cost concerns, Nyika suggested negotiations by middle- and low-income countries and possible local or regional production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These can help bring the cost down, but also leveraging the existing supply chain, community health system and different service delivery modules will help ensure equitable access," Nyika said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partnership with PEPFAR and the Global Fund is expected to significantly reduce the pricing of the "miracle drug."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, Eswatini and Botswana are also among those countries selected for the rollout by January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

                Scientists found smokers who quit in middle age and older may have a lower risk for dementia than those who continue to smoke.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that quitting smoking – even in middle age or beyond – can slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While cognitive decline naturally occurs with aging, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract?_fsi=0YzsSmVe" target="_blank"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that smoking exacerbates it and may &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34298890/" target="_blank"&gt;increase the risk&lt;/a&gt; of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14659891.2017.1405087" target="_blank"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; found that quitting smoking early in life may reduce these effects. Mikaela Bloomberg, an epidemiologist at the University College London and the lead author on the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(25)00072-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;paper published this week&lt;/a&gt;, says those who break the habit early showed cognitive scores comparable to those of people who never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She wanted to find out whether quitting later in life would have a similar impact.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;To find out, the team of researchers looked at survey data from more than 9,000 participants 40 years or older across 12 countries. They matched people who had quit smoking with continuing smokers according to their starting cognitive scores and other characteristics, including sex, age, education level and birth country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their results showed that for those who had quit smoking, verbal fluency declined at a rate roughly half that of their smoking counterparts. For memory, the decline was reduced by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of older people might think that there's no point in quitting after decades of smoking, but our study suggests that quitting even later in life is linked with slower cognitive decline," says Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Neal Benowitz, a cardiovascular physician and clinical pharmacologist who has studied the health effects of tobacco, says it's a significant study, especially for older smokers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One of the important problems in tobacco control is that older smokers are not quitting at very high rates like younger smokers are," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Benowitz adds that citing the study in campaigns encouraging older smokers to quit or switch to a non-combusted form of nicotine, such as e-cigarettes or nicotine pouches, could be a good next step.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Smokers have an &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118333" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, a leading cause of death worldwide. Cigarette smoke exposes the body to high levels of oxidative stress, explains Benowitz. This process damages cells and tissues, including small blood vessels that supply oxygen to the brain, which can result in inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It affects cardiovascular health and "can cause things like stroke," Bloomberg says, "and all of those things can impact cognitive function because they're damaging the brain structures that give rise to cognitive function." She notes there's some evidence that it could contribute to dementia risk as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg agrees the study could motivate stopping smoking later in life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You'd think you might need to quit during early to midlife, and then you sort of have missed this kind of critical period for when you can quit. But that just doesn't seem to be the case here," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She adds: "It's never too late to quit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in knowing more about science behind the headlines?

My mind was in a spin,” she said, calling the diagnosis “a big shock.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brinklow received some positive news — the cancer hadn’t spread beyond her right breast — she still needed to undergo a double mastectomy as her cancer was&lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-diagnosed-with-two-types-of-breast-cancer-in-one-breast-shares-her-story-8714706" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:positive for estrogen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; positive for estrogen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that means it’s less aggressive, as the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/er-positive-breast-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains, “There’s a risk of recurrence after treatment, including treatment for early-stage, low-risk ER-positive breast cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinklow was back on her feet as soon as possible: “Following surgery I was out walking for miles every day. You could say I walked myself better.” Her motivation, she said, was her music, as she explained, “When you play the bagpipes you really do need to be able to raise your arms up above your head … lots of women don’t get their full mobility back [after surgery].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Brinklow / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Julie Brinklow in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recovery is “a very slow process,” Brinklow says, adding that she’s “still improving all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I am back to doing everything that I used to do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinklow hopes her story can warn others that breast cancer comes in all shapes and sizes. As she explained, “I probably wouldn’t have done anything about it if I hadn’t been nagged. A tumor doesn’t have to be a small hard lump, it can be something that just feels like a thickness that you haven’t noticed before, like part of your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t delay in getting checked out if you think there is something different or that you haven’t noticed before,” she said. “The thing that sticks in my mind is that I wasn’t worried about it, and I should have been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEOPLE has reached out to Brinklow for more information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/musician-thought-she-strained-herself-playing-the-bagpipes-11826967" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 06:08:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBpaU90TEVfdXlJWFgtZWdZN0IxZmtucEdUUkI0TE1MSk1rekpsRnZTU0I3SzVGMnZxZ1R5R3VUQjdaU1lWcW9VR3VfUEg5TlVsX19LRjFNbm4zcFhJNnMyN2pLMWJTbzFiS2NRdUZDQThQNzN4</guid></item></channel></rss>
