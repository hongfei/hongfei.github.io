However, in about half of these donations after circulatory death (DCD) cases, the transplant ends up being cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That is because the time between the removal of life support and death must not exceed 45 minutes. If the donor does not die within the timeframe needed to preserve organ quality, surgeons often reject the liver because of the increased risk of complications to the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now doctors, scientists and researchers at Stanford University have developed a machine learning model that predicts whether a donor is likely to die within the timeframe during which their organs are viable for transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The AI tool outperformed the judgment of top surgeons and reduced the rate of futile procurements – which occur when transplant preparations have begun but the donor dies too late – by 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By identifying when an organ is likely to be useful before any preparations for surgery have started, this model could make the transplant process more efficient,” said Dr Kazunari Sasaki, a clinical professor of abdominal transplantation and senior author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It also has the potential to allow more candidates who need an organ transplant to receive one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Details of the breakthrough were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(25)00100-1/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the Lancet Digital Health journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The advance could reduce the number of instances in which healthcare workers prepare organs for recovery, only to determine they are unsuitable for recovery and transplantation, putting financial and operational strain on transplant centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hospitals primarily rely on surgeons’ judgment to estimate this critical timeframe, which can vary widely and lead to unnecessary costs and wasted resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new AI tool was trained on data from more than 2,000 donors across several US transplant centres. It uses neurological, respiratory and circulatory data to predict a potential donor’s progression to death with greater accuracy than previous models and human experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

&lt;p&gt;“While mismatched vaccines may still provide protection, enhanced genetic, antigenic and epidemiological (eg, vaccine effectiveness) monitoring are warranted to inform risk assessment and response,” Skowronski and colleagues concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the UK Health Security Agency published a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-print-early-influenza-virus-characterisation-and-vaccine-effectiveness-in-england-in-autumn-2025"&gt;preliminary study&lt;/a&gt; finding that, despite the mismatch, this year’s shot still seems to provide important protection. The study found that soon after vaccination, the vaccine provided 70 to 75 percent protection against hospitalization in children aged 2 to 17 years, and 30 to 40 percent protection from hospitalization in adults. These protection levels are within the typical range for flu vaccines, but they’re more often seen at the end of a season—when vaccine protection has waned some—rather than early in the season, soon after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, officials called the results “&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade"&gt;reassuring&lt;/a&gt;.” In particular, officials noted the strong numbers in children, which parents can tell you, have the ability to be superspreaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The high vaccine effectiveness in children strengthens the case for ensuring all eligible young people get vaccinated,” Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation at UKHSA, said. “When more children are protected, it helps stop the spread of flu to others around them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is that it’s looking possible that we may be facing a very bad flu season this year, and the best thing we can all do right now to tackle the problem is to get vaccinated,” Adam Finn, professor of Paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it’s unclear how flu vaccinations are going in the US this season, at the end of last season, only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/adult-coverage.html"&gt;about 47 percent of adults&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html"&gt;49 percent of children&lt;/a&gt; had received vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard brain implants use electrodes that penetrate the gray matter to stimulate and record the activity of neurons. These typically need to be put in place via a surgical procedure. To go around that need, a team of researchers led by Deblina Sarkar, an electrical engineer and MIT assistant professor, developed microscopic electronic devices hybridized with living cells. Those cells can be injected into the circulatory system with a standard syringe and will travel the bloodstream before implanting themselves in target brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the first two years of working on this technology at MIT, we’ve got 35 grant proposals rejected in a row,” Sarkar says. “Comments we got from the reviewers were that our idea was very impactful, but it was impossible.” She acknowledges that the proposal sounded like something you can find in science fiction novels. But after more than six years of research, she and her colleagues have pulled it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nanobot problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, when Sarkar and her colleagues gathered initial data and got some promising results with their cell-electronics hybrids, the team proposed the project for the National Institutes of Health Director’s New Innovator Award. For the first time, after 35 rejections, it made it through peer review. “We got the highest impact score ever,” Sarkar says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for that score was that her technology solved three extremely difficult problems. The first, obviously, was making functional electronic devices smaller than cells that can circulate in our blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Previous explorations, which had not seen a lot of success, relied on putting magnetic particles inside the bloodstream and then guiding them with magnetic fields,” Sarkar explains. “But there is a difference between electronics and particles.” Electronics made using CMOS technology (which we use for making computer processors) can generate electrical power from incoming light in the same way as photovoltaics, as well as perform computations necessary for more intelligent applications like sensing. Particles, on the other hand, can only be used to stimulate cells to an extent.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Scientists may have uncovered an important aspect of long covid. Recent research appears to show that the blood of these patients often contains unusual clusters of microscopic material.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stellenbosch University in South Africa examined the blood of people with and without long covid. Those with the chronic condition had a greater amount of microclots combined with web-like structures called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), the study found. The findings could help doctors better identify long covid cases and might even help explain some of the symptoms these patients experience, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings present a significant advancement in the understanding of the interactions between NETs and microclots in long covid,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70613"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in The Journal of Medical Virology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microclots and NETs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Long covid is a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-challenges-of-unravelling-long-covid-1846644037"&gt;complex condition&lt;/a&gt; and is likely to be caused by a mix of factors, including viral persistence or an ongoing dysfunctional immune response to the earlier covid infection. But some research has suggested that the symptoms of long covid, such as lasting fatigue or brain fog, can be linked to chronic inflammation and blood clotting issues, at least for some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s past work and others have found that people with long covid are more likely to have tiny fiber-like particles in their blood, dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2023/05/16/long-covid-scientists-try-to-unravel-blood-clot-mystery/"&gt;microclots&lt;/a&gt;, than the average person, for instance. Other studies have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565006/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that long covid patients also have higher amounts of NETs, sticky structures produced by immune cells called neutrophils that help trap germs. Though NETs are important to combatting infections, their excess presence may &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-024-01933-x"&gt;contribute&lt;/a&gt; to harmful inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this latest research, the Stellenbosch team wanted to better understand how the NETs and microclots seen in long covid patients might interact with one another, if at all. They compared the blood of 50 people diagnosed with long covid to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They found that people with long covid had higher levels of biomarkers linked to both NETs and microclots than the controls. Long covid patients seemed to have larger microclots on average as well. And perhaps most importantly, those with long covid also appeared to have more microclots that were structurally connected to NETs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, NETs might play an important role in keeping microclots safe from eradication by the body, which could then explain why people’s long covid symptoms continue to linger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We suggest that higher NETs formation might promote the stabilization of microclots in the circulation, potentially leading to deleterious effects which contribute causally to the LC syndrome,” they wrote. If so, finding a safe and effective way to clear microclots and NETs could potentially alleviate symptoms as well, they add.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;More research needed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intriguing as these findings are, they’re certainly not the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While research has found that people with long covid are more likely to have microclots, for instance, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD015775_what-evidence-microclots-cause-post-covid-19-syndrome-and-removal-using-plasmapheresis-justified"&gt;not clear yet&lt;/a&gt; if and to what extent these structures are responsible for causing people’s illness. And given the complicated nature of the condition, it’s certainly possible only some people’s long covid will end up conclusively linked to these particles.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers say their work could still help doctors devise tests that can easily identify long covid cases—something that isn’t possible today. In this current study, they developed an algorithm that appeared to accurately distinguish between long covid patients and controls, based on their distinctive biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though covid-19 is no longer the pandemic threat it once was, the infectious disease is not gone. And there are still millions of people worldwide &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-common-is-long-covid-1849130767"&gt;believed to be afflicted&lt;/a&gt; by long covid. The more we understand about its mechanisms, the greater the chance we can develop effective treatments for these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

By then, 1,189 cases of early-onset conventional adenomas and 1,598 cases of another type of polyp, known as a serrated lesion, had been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team divided participants into five equal sized groups based on their UPF consumption, finding that compared with the group that ate the least UPF – on average 3.3 servings a day – the group that ate the most – on average 9.9 servings a day – had a 45% greater risk of having early onset conventional adenomas once factors such as BMI, smoking and physical activity were taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, there was no associated risk of developing serrated lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study has limitations including that it is based on participants’ recall of food, may be complicated by difficulties in classifying foods as UPFs, did not look at the development of bowel cancer itself, and cannot prove UPFs cause the development of polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, Chen said there were several plausible mechanisms that could explain the results, noting UPFs had been associated with metabolic disorders linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes that were associated with an increased risk of bowel cancer. He also said UPFs could promote a general state of chronic inflammation, or might impact gut microbes and the gut lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chan said while it was likely the results would also hold for men, more research was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It doesn’t suggest that if you eat UPFs, that you are inevitably going to develop cancer. That’s certainly not our message,” he said. “But it’s a piece of the puzzle in terms of what might be driving underlying cancer rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fiona Osgun, the head of health information at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, said that while the study did not directly measure cancer risk, it offered a useful insight into how diet might influence early changes in the bowel that sometimes led to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Osgun added that policy-level changes were needed to make healthier diets more accessible for everyone. “Our overall diet matters more for cancer risk than any single food type,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 18:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxPTERKYWVtVDBuRU5yXzhzVXlicHBJMDBqV0RXRVBxMzFCTE5lazFQRDV5SzlCblYxMnREM3l0ckNTQ3hqQk4xV1FYNl9HLXFJal9pSnhWVnctS2laN0VDN0xJSE5IRlgwMU96cThPSmE4eDNpZEJ0V1VIUUotc2pEV2ZPeG5URDluX0NmR2J2cjFVZkdUMTBWUy1ZU18tLUFueWtvcjJYc3NsblZDenpZSnYxRVNuLU5yRlNLRW1VcjUtVldrSGQtWmtmMEFrOXM</guid></item><item><title>CRISPR与胆固醇：基因编辑可以预防心脏病吗？ -自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03711-3</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03711-3/d41586-025-03711-3_51702842.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03711-3/d41586-025-03711-3_51702842.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Coloured scanning electron micrograph of cholesterol crystals (blue) within a lipid droplet (brown) in a human liver." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03711-3/d41586-025-03711-3_51702842.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Crystalline forms of cholesterol (blue) in a liver cell (purple), imaged using a scanning electron microscope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CRISPR–Cas9 &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03797-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03797-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;gene-editing therapy&lt;/a&gt; has halved people’s &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00955-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00955-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; in a small clinical trial — raising hopes that, with further study, gene editing could one day be harnessed to provide a one-stop treatment for a common cause of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02916-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02916-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers used CRISPR to disable a gene called &lt;i&gt;ANGPTL3&lt;/i&gt; that helps to regulate levels of fatty molecules, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or ‘bad’ cholesterol and triglycerides, in the blood.

But, if all goes well in future studies, investigators hope that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03566-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03566-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;gene editing&lt;/a&gt; might one day liberate many thousands of people from daily regimens of cholesterol-lowering medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What a revolution to be able to do that,” says Luke Laffin, a specialist in preventative cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and a lead investigator on the trial. “Conceptually, it’s a great idea: we can move from chronic therapy to something that’s one-and-done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That revolution will take years: considerably more safety testing would be needed to make the concept a reality, he adds. And there are questions about how much such a treatment would cost, and whether consumers would be willing to embrace it. But the trial results — published in the &lt;i&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/i&gt; on 8 November — are the latest to show promise in harnessing gene-editing techniques to tackle some of the most common diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Decade-long dream&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dream scenario for me is getting these gene-editing therapies broadly applied,” says Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “These things are coming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little over a decade ago, Musunuru wondered if CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing, then a new technology, could be harnessed to prevent or treat the world’s leading killer: cardiovascular disease. He pitched the idea to a few venture capitalists. “No one was interested at all,” he says. Instead, they wanted to focus on rare genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02802-5" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03711-3/d41586-025-03711-3_51425162.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Hope for diabetes: CRISPR-edited cells pump out insulin in a person – and evade immune detection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Musunuru says he knows of about a dozen companies that intend to use gene editing to tackle high cholesterol. Other cardiovascular projects include treatments for a rarer condition called transthyretin amyloidosis, which can lead to heart failure. Biotechnology company CRISPR Therapeutics in Zug, Switzerland — the sponsor of the current cholesterol trial — has begun work on a gene-editing therapy to treat high blood pressure. “It’s fertile ground,” says Musunuru, who is himself a co-founder of a company that’s pursuing similar treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shifting from rare diseases to more common ones will require big safety studies that are capable of detecting unusual side effects, and CRISPR-based therapies have been used in only a few hundred people so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The study, published in the Nature journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03206-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, synthesizes decades of research and suggests that this chemical difference could open new avenues for understanding and potentially treating these common and debilitating illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders, which include conditions like generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social phobias, represent the most common category of mental illness in the United States. “Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting about 30% of adults,” said Richard Maddock, the study’s senior author and a research professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, Davis. “They can be debilitating for people, and many people do not receive adequate treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conditions are understood to involve complex interactions between different brain regions. Areas like the amygdala, which acts as a threat detector, and the prefrontal cortex, which helps manage planning and emotional responses, can become dysregulated. This can cause the brain to perceive manageable, everyday stressors as overwhelming threats, leading to persistent worry and nervousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research comes from Maddock and his colleague Jason Smucny, an assistant professor at UC Davis. Maddock, a psychiatrist who has spent decades treating patients and researching anxiety, had previously observed low levels of choline in his own studies of people with panic disorder. This prompted him and Smucny to investigate whether this was a consistent pattern seen across the scientific literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find an answer, the researchers conducted a meta-analysis, a type of study that systematically combines and analyzes the results of many previous independent studies. This method allows scientists to detect broad patterns that might not be apparent in smaller, individual experiments. They gathered data from 25 separate studies, creating a large dataset that included 370 people diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and 342 people without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies they analyzed all used a specialized, non-invasive imaging technique called proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This method uses the same type of machine as a standard magnetic resonance imaging scan, which creates pictures of the body’s internal structures. Instead of producing an image, however, this technique provides a chemical profile of a specific brain region, allowing researchers to measure the concentration of different molecules, known as neurometabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a distinct and consistent chemical difference. Across the various anxiety disorders, individuals with these conditions had lower levels of choline-containing compounds in their brains. The reduction was most pronounced in the brain’s cortex, the outer layer responsible for higher-order functions like thinking, decision-making, and emotional regulation. The finding was especially consistent in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, the level of choline was about 8% lower in those with anxiety disorders. While this number might seem small, even minor changes in the brain’s chemical environment can have significant effects on its function. “An 8% lower amount doesn’t sound like that much, but in the brain it’s significant,” Maddock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this chemical pattern was “transdiagnostic,” meaning it appeared to be a common feature across different types of anxiety disorders rather than being unique to one specific condition. The team also examined whether other factors, such as patient medication, age, or the technical specifications of the brain scans, could explain the results. The link between anxiety and lower choline held firm, suggesting it is a robust biological marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding became even more defined when the researchers assessed the quality of the measurements in the original studies. In the subset of studies that used the most precise measurement techniques, the reduction in choline was even more apparent. This strengthens the confidence that the observed difference is a real phenomenon and not an artifact of inconsistent data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also looked at other neurometabolites, including N-acetylaspartate, a molecule often used as an indicator of the health and integrity of neurons. After removing a few outlier studies from the analysis, the researchers found a small but significant reduction in this molecule as well, suggesting a possible widespread effect on neuronal function in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline is an essential nutrient that plays a fundamental part in building cell membranes and producing neurotransmitters involved in memory, mood, and muscle control. While the body can produce a small amount on its own, the majority must be obtained through food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose that the chronic state of high alert, or “fight-or-flight” response, common in anxiety disorders may increase the brain’s metabolic activity. This heightened state could place a greater demand on choline resources to maintain neural circuits, gradually leading to lower overall levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize that this study identifies a strong correlation, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship. It is not yet clear whether lower choline levels contribute to the development of anxiety, or if the biological processes of anxiety itself cause choline levels to drop. Further work is needed to untangle this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these open questions, the finding points toward potential new strategies for patient care. “This is the first meta-analysis to show a chemical pattern in the brain in anxiety disorders,” said Smucny. “It suggests nutritional approaches — like appropriate choline supplementation — may help restore brain chemistry and improve outcomes for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to test this idea directly. “We don’t know yet if increasing choline in the diet will help reduce anxiety. More research will be needed,” Maddock said. He cautions that people experiencing anxiety should not begin taking high-dose choline supplements on their own, as the effects are not yet understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the research highlights the connection between diet and mental well-being. A healthy diet is a cornerstone of overall health, and ensuring adequate nutrient intake may be particularly relevant for brain function. Choline is found in a variety of foods, including eggs, beef, chicken, soybeans, and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Someone with an anxiety disorder might want to look at their diet and see whether they are getting the recommended daily amount of choline,” Maddock noted, adding that many people in the U.S. do not consume enough. “Some forms of omega-3 fatty acids, like those found in salmon, may be especially good sources for supplying choline to the brain.” This discovery of a consistent chemical signature offers a new window into the biology of anxiety and reinforces the idea that what we eat has a profound connection to how we feel and think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03206-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Transdiagnostic reduction in cortical choline-containing compounds in anxiety disorders: a 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Richard J.

Now, they may have an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the first of two studies published Thursday in the journal Nature, researchers at NYU Langone Health have discovered immune reactions that may explain why these organs get rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The team looked at the transplantation of a genetically engineered pig kidney into a patient who was brain dead but had a beating heart and was on a ventilator in the ICU. The family had donated the patient's body to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For more than two months after the surgery, the NYU Langone team performed biopsies and collected samples of blood, tissue and bodily fluid from the patient in a way that's "impossible" to do in primates or living patients, according to Dr. Robert Montgomery, lead author of the study and director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Stock photo of doctors performing a surgery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Alvaro Gonzalez/STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We could really get a very dense set of data points from doing biopsies, taking blood samples, body fluid samples and create an atlas of what that immune response looks like," he told ABC News. "And that's what's really unique about the study. I think that this is probably the most deeply studied human in history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The team learned that pig organs were being rejected due to an immune system reaction from specific antibodies -- which recognize and attach themselves to foreign substances so they can be removed from the body -- and from T cells, which are white blood cells that help the body fight off germs and other unfamiliar invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;After rejection, the team used an FDA-approved drug combination to successfully reverse it, with no signs of permanent damage or reduced kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's a huge step forward," Montgomery said. "I think it makes transplantation just that much more of a successful endeavor. As we move forward, I do believe that we will be in a position in the next few years where gene-edited pig organs will be an alternative to human organs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a second study published in Nature, Montgomery and his team looked at the body's immune response to the pig organ in greater detail. By measuring levels of biomarkers in the blood, they were able to spot an attack up to five days before it would be visible in bodily tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Montgomery said this can help transplant teams anticipate a potential rejection sooner and diagnose it quickly so it can be subsequently treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;More than 101,000 Americans are in need of a kidney transplant but only 17,000 receive a transplant every year, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.kidney.org/be-organ-donor" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;National Kidney Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, 12 people die every day while waiting for a kidney. The average wait time on the transplant list can be as long as 10 years. Montgomery said finding a way for more people waiting on the list to receive a kidney with gene-edited pig organs, while lowering the risk of rejection, is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"That's a great shortcoming of our health care system that we have to ration something that we know works so well," Montgomery said. "I think we really do need an alternative source of organs to really change this game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The procedure, while considered by many to be a medical breakthrough, is still controversial, with some critics expressing ethical concerns about altering animal organs and potential health risks for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;Some patients who have undergone the procedure have had the genetically modified pig kidneys removed after organ rejection or unrelated infection. At least two patients have died after transplantation, although doctors say these patients were terminal and were experiencing end-stage kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>abcnews.go.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>与50岁以下女性结直肠癌风险相关的超加工食品-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/well/eat/ultraprocessed-foods-colorectal-cancer-risk.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:03:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQR3ljLWJwN3RyMUNfX2dCY3FPYXl0Z0R3dFo2YXlCMkMxcVZtelVWbmJ3eDJOQkc2M3J6NTlJNGdPZWVVQmFpbXVQbjFHNGZmTGw4Q3pQRWI2SWx2QjFIOGJoQWxPRFNibDNndGdEODdMTnVfNWRuUkhLQnpnMnJtME1mNUFfNnNqRUZBSEZKT3ZONmVsb3RJ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，超加工食品与癌前息肉风险增加有关- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/ultra-processed-foods-linked-increased-risk-precancerous-polyps-study-rcna243574</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-773049" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating more ultra-processed foods is tied to an increased risk of precancerous colorectal growths in women under 50, according to a study published Thursday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2841354" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16832d" class="body-graf"&gt;These growths, called adenomas or polyps, can later turn into cancer and are a good indicator of a person’s cancer risk, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a060b" class="body-graf"&gt;Rates of colorectal cancer in people under 50 have risen sharply in recent decades. The findings could offer new insights into what’s driving this increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-36e5c2" class="body-graf"&gt;“One approach we’ve been taking is trying to understand what has changed in our environment that could be driving this. What are some trends that mirror this acceleration in cancer rates?” said study leader Dr. Andrew Chan, a gastroenterologist and the chief of the clinical and translational epidemiology unit at Massachusetts General Brigham in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-845e9f" class="body-graf"&gt;Ultra-processed foods now &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ultra-processed-foods-make-majority-kids-diet-cdc-report-finds-rcna223481" target="_blank"&gt;make up the bulk&lt;/a&gt; of the average American’s diet, especially among kids. The foods, which tend to be high in calories, have been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/ultraprocessed-foods-linked-depression-study-finds-rcna106811" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/eating-food-additives-together-may-increase-diabetes-risk-study-sugges-rcna200163" target="_blank"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/highly-processed-food-linked-early-death-study-rcna55455" target="_blank"&gt;early death&lt;/a&gt;. Some experts have also suspected eating these foods could be driving the increase in colorectal cancer rates among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0e8cef" class="body-graf"&gt;To test this hypothesis, Chan and his team used data from more than 29,000 women who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study II, an ongoing study of female registered nurses established in 1989. The women, who were between 24 and 42 when they enrolled in the study, were followed for 24 years, from 1991 through 2015. Every four years, everyone filled out a questionnaire about their diets, and everyone had at least one colonoscopy before 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5dd606" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers looked at whether the women were diagnosed with precancerous polyps: either adenomas, which are more likely to turn into cancer, or serrated lesions. While only about 5% of adenomas are cancerous, about 75% of colorectal cancers start as adenomas, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15370-colon-polyps" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Serrated lesions are still considered precancerous but are linked to fewer cases of colorectal cancer, Chan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e0b99" class="body-graf"&gt;The study found a connection between eating more ultra-processed foods and developing an adenoma before 50. It didn’t see any links between the foods and serrated lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c85a4" class="body-graf"&gt;Because the majority of colon cancers arise from adenomas, the study showing  a link between eating more ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of developing adenomas specifically gave Chan and his team more confidence that these foods could increase colorectal cancer risk, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1fd075" class="body-graf"&gt;“The strength was that we looked at two major types of polyps — it’s the adenoma type that seems to underlie cancer, and we saw the link between that,” he said. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b604a5" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1,200 women in the study developed adenomas. Compared to those who ate the fewest ultra-processed foods, those who ate the most — accounting for one-third of their daily calories — were about 1.5 times more likely to develop adenomas. Specific foods also appeared to increase risk. Diets higher in sugar and artificial sweeteners were most linked to higher rates of adenomas, followed by diets high in sauces, spreads and condiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f02b73" class="body-graf"&gt;Although the study included only women, the majority of whom were white, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/evidence-links-highly-processed-food-cancer-death-rcna45713" target="_blank"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have also found a link between men eating more ultra-processed foods and developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-477138" class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t have any reason to believe there would be a difference in men compared to women,” Chan said, adding that additional research should include men to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-458f5f" class="body-graf"&gt;Most colorectal polyps do not turn into cancer, but nearly all colorectal cancer does start as a polyp, said Dr. Folasade May, a gastroenterologist and an associate professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who wasn’t involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-50622b" class="body-graf"&gt;This is why doctors remove any polyps they find during a colonoscopy, and why people who have polyps are considered to be at higher risk for developing colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c7b04" class="body-graf"&gt;“They are looking at the first step, who is more likely to get these polyps that can turn into cancer,” May said of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc08bb" class="body-graf"&gt;The problem is that routine screening for colorectal cancer does not happen until age 45, said Dr. Christopher Lieu, the co-director of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine in Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-24e303" class="body-graf"&gt;“The concern is that whenever you have a polyp in a young person, that polyp is allowed to grow unnoticed, and because you are not screening those young patients,” Lieu said. This makes it even more important to identify the modifiable lifestyle factors that are driving increased rates of colorectal cancer in young people, added Lieu, who wasn’t involved with the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33c0a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Although scientists have yet to determine a clear cause, the rise in rates is unlikely to be driven by genetics, May said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dcf61" class="body-graf"&gt;“This has happened very fast, so it is likely unfortunately something we have done to ourselves as humans, in the way we live our lives,” she said. “It’s jarring, hearing stories every week about people in their 20s, 30s, 40s getting cancers that, when I was in medical school, we were taught happen in people in their 80s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40e10b" class="body-graf"&gt;Ultra-processed foods cause inflammation in the gut — which includes the colon — that impairs the gut’s ability to repair itself when damaged and keep tumors at bay. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/anti-inflammatory-diet-may-help-colon-cancer-patients-live-longer-stud-rcna209539" target="_blank"&gt;High levels of inflammation&lt;/a&gt; are also linked to cancer in general, May said. Another hypothesis is that people who eat more ultra-processed foods are more likely to have obesity and Type 2 diabetes, both which are linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/obesity.html" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a6bbe" class="body-graf"&gt;“More likely, it’s the direct toxic effects of these ultra-processed foods,” May said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c1effe" class="body-graf"&gt;Chan, the study author, said ultra-processed foods are known to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-young-people-dna-damage-gut-toxin-antibiotics-rcna202572" target="_blank"&gt;alter the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, which, in theory, could make cells in the gut more likely to turn cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96dcf8" class="body-graf"&gt;The next step in the research is determining whether any of these hypotheses appear to have a causal effect on who develops colorectal cancer at a young age. It’s likely part of the puzzle, Chan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e19e06" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“One thing that has been clear is that the U.S. intake of ultra-processed food has really risen in the past few decades in a way that mirrors the staggering increase in colorectal cancer cases,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPZ2YxYW5ncG9GUEREbzVTNTcyMXdiMXFXTnMzd3MtamdJTlVPc19pZU5HbTJfREluV2dpclZJSWJCVWxPdm1ZNzRrWU94ejROZlpVRzBKX2pHWWdFTzdMSGFXVl9vSG9aVDlZTFVwRlBpTG9lVVVYem5fMk9HZDVIQVZzdkt0SHFHM2JZRE5BRkxzRVVZUURjTFJuN0RYZVFsWER6VWUtRnBwcXVmSVJBQUlqNTRTZ09kY3fSAVZBVV95cUxNSmJ3U2xHamhtRHZqRzB1ei1UUnpHX3dQdWxjQXNUN0lkS0FuWHNwS0tEVm1aWkozaWxsc19iMkdXQnZvTGlDc3Rra3Yya1VIZFM4NDF6QQ</guid></item><item><title>妈妈分享了她在乳腺癌诊断前几个月出现的“疯狂和令人兴奋”的症状- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/mom-shares-crazy-mind-blowing-213032138.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Mann/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; Kelly Mann&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Mann started experiencing recurring pink eye infections in April 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and later learned that her eye symptoms were actually episcleritis, a condition triggered by the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom of three is now using her platform to raise awareness and share her breast cancer journey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman is recalling the “mind-blowing” symptom she experienced months before she was diagnosed with breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two years ago, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/kellymann/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kelly Mann;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kelly Mann&lt;/a&gt;, a university professor from Abilene, Texas, started suffering from “the worst pink eye of my life,” she told &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-symptom-pink-eye-episcleritis-rcna243059" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TODAY;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TODAY&lt;/a&gt;. Antibiotic eye drops wouldn’t relieve the redness in her eyes, but after a week, the issue resolved itself. Her symptoms were gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the pink eye returned, beginning a cycle that occurred six times between April and June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then one night while watching TV, I went to itch my arm and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer/pictures-of-breast-cancer-lumps-signs-rcna53603" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:felt a lump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;felt a lump&lt;/a&gt;," she recalled. "My husband was asleep, so I kind of panicked and went back and forth, like, 'Is this what I’m really feeling, or am I making this up in my head?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Mann/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; Kelly Mann&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann immediately made a doctor’s appointment the next morning. After a mammogram and biopsy, she received life-changing news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late July 2023, Mann was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer, just a week before her 36th birthday. Mann was devastated by the discovery, especially because she had a breast exam just in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was, obviously, devastated," she told the outlet. "My tumor grew from being completely undetectable to 2 and a half centimeters in about six to eight weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a few weeks, Mann started chemotherapy treatment, which led to a “crazy” realization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After my first chemo, I had the same pink eye situation pop up again," she said. "I was so frustrated, and it was one of the worst versions of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

While there is no known cause, it can be associated with an underlying inflammatory or rheumatologic condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your eye, being an organ, will respond in unique ways to things happening in your body," Mann explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Episcleritis was my &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-symptoms-doctor-monitors-in-herself-rcna234706" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:first real, tangible symptom;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;first real, tangible symptom&lt;/a&gt; that I had," she said. "I thought it was fascinating and also crazy and mind-blowing that your body really does know what’s going on far before any normal diagnostics could make sense of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann, now 38, was given steroid eye drops to help manage her symptoms moving forward. She underwent 12 rounds of chemotherapy, a bilateral mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery. The mom of three then continued a number of breast cancer therapies through October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Mann/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; Kelly Mann&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann admitted that her treatment journey has been difficult and she still sporadically deals with episcleritis, but because of her children — "three little souls watching me and worried about me" — she wouldn’t allow herself to give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a cancer survivor, Mann is using her social media platform to share her journey and raise awareness for episcleritis and early detection. She admitted that building a community online has helped her connect with so many young patients like herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sometimes I’m the first person they told, or it’s their caregivers that are reaching out to me," she told TODAY.

The &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-01547" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:latest study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt; under that umbrella examines people who took less than 8,000 daily steps, &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;they took them (in short or long bursts?), and what that cadence meant for cardiovascular health. Ultimately, researchers found that walking in longer bouts significantly cut cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Berg, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center; and &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/mary-greene-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Greene, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mary Greene, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in New York City and LabFinder contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, cardiologists explain the conclusions and attempt to settle the step saga—as it pertains to heart health, at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at accelerometer (step counter) data from 33, 560 people in the United Kingdom who took 8,000 or fewer daily steps and were initially free of cardiovascular disease or cancer. They were categorized into sedentary participants (who had fewer than 5,000 daily steps) and low-active participants (who had 5,000 to 7,999 daily steps).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over an average of 7.9 years, researchers tracked participants’ health and learned that people who took most of their daily steps in longer bouts (between 10 and 15 minutes at a time) had lower all-cause death rates and lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to those who took their steps in shorter durations. Those conclusions were “much more prominent in the sedentary group,” says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Berg, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most studies, this one has its limitations. The findings are observational and also contain implicit bias, as people who tend to take longer walks may also make healthier choices, notes &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/mary-greene-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Greene, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mary Greene, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in New York City and LabFinder contributor. However, the findings do suggest that sustained activity over 10 or more minutes “may be necessary to stimulate the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of activity that doesn’t occur in five minutes or less,” explains Dr. Greene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly: “This research further emphasizes the danger of sedentary behavior,” says Dr. Berg. “It also suggests that the spacing of activity, even in those who are very sedentary, is related to the degree of cardiovascular risk.” &lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why longer walks work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Longer or more continuous walking raises your heart rate and cardiac output in a more sustained way, which trains the heart and improves cardiovascular fitness more so than small bursts of activity,” explains Dr. Greene. “This sustained activity also improved insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism in study participants, which can reduce cardiovascular risk factors like diabetes and atherosclerotic [artery] disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What advice is right?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking, what about “exercise snacks,” or past research that says even short, small bursts of activity are helpful? Well, those aren’t necessarily wrong. “Both ‘exercise snacks’ and sustained activity are good for health. Something is always better than nothing,” says Dr. Greene. “Sustained activity is better, adding ‘snacks’ to a regimen of sustained activity is best!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important message to take away from these findings is that taking less than 4,000 daily steps is “detrimental,” Dr. Greene notes. And, if you can get in at least around 7,000, that appears to be the well-studied, average on-ramp to cardiovascular benefits, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is, the longer bouts of activity that this research suggests won’t “happen by accident” and will likely take some planning, Dr. Berg notes. “This may mean scheduling 10 minutes to walk with a co-worker during lunch or incorporating a walk as part of a daily routine,” he adds. You can even intentionally take the longer route to get somewhere, or park further out in a parking lot. “Write it down in your calendar and hold yourself to it,” Dr. Berg continues. “Couple it to something enjoyable to make it more attractive—walk to your favorite coffee shop or call your best friend.” And if you miss a day, don’t let it set you back and squeeze in some steps where you can. “Anything is better than nothing,” Dr. Berg concludes.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;If you are sedentary, start slow with a general increase in activity,” like taking the stairs, recommends Dr. Greene. “Start to aim for at least 7,000 steps per day. As you build up endurance, then start sustained walking sessions with a pace that is comfortably uncomfortable.” In other words, do your best to get your heart rate up, and work your way up to 10 minutes of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can, add some resistance training and/or body weight exercises as well, which can also provide other health benefits,” says Dr. Greene. “As with anything, consistency is key! It’s more important to be consistent with moving your body than it is to be perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:37:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQaVlDR0prVWl0ZWJkc0VGTzlYMVR0RVg3NnFzTXNZWF8tSE1JLXRNNTlvRnpfdTRjVzItQ0NNaWVic3lsbUJQRXF3bkZaZHJkZ1NlMFlhVnh0VHJtVzF3T1FXTm9LZ1I4NGxvaGx1UVd1QWZlZEtNbm9VNTdFY3J2M1BOV05EU2RIQWxuVWJ6bVU</guid></item><item><title>不是有氧运动，但这对大脑来说是最好的运动，甚至可以减缓认知衰退， lon说-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/not-cardio-but-this-is-the-best-exercise-for-the-brain-and-can-even-slow-down-cognitive-decay-says-longevity-expert/articleshow/125297836.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that just like our bodies, our brains need exercise too. And when it comes to cognitive decline, aerobic exercise, also known as cardio has been considered the ‘gold standard’ to keep it at bay. However, it turns out that it might not be the case. Aerobic exercise, while excellent otherwise, might lag behind when it comes to cognitive sharpness. So, which exercise is the magic pill, really? Turns out, it is resistance training. A growing body of research is highlighting resistance training, whether through weight‑lifting or other strength‑building routines, as a boost for brain health and memory. Austin Perlmutter, MD, and longevity expert reveals more…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fresh evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the go‑to brain‑health tip has been cardio-walking, running, cycling-because those moves boost heart function, and increase blood flow to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately though, research is shedding light on another kind of exercise: resistance training, whether it means lifting dumbbells, or pulling on bands, seems to have a stronger effect on memory and cognition, especially in older adults and people showing early signs of cognitive decline. Recognising this shift, gives us a chance to keep our brains protected, as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Daily habits to follow every night for a sharper brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How resistance training helps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimer-europe.org/news/recent-study-demonstrates-resistance-training-preserves-white-brain-matter-adults-mci?language_content_entity=en" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have shown that resistance training enhances memory, attention and decision‑making abilities effectively, more than, or at least on par with, regular exercise. In a landmark randomised controlled trial, older women who performed one or two sessions of resistance training per week, exhibited notable improvements in selective attention and conflict resolution, core components of executive cognition. A separate &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1131214/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; of adults with cognitive impairment revealed that resistance training helped preserve brain volume in memory‑critical regions such as the hippocampus, thereby slowing the pace of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects are important, because cognitive impairment currently responds poorly to medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why hitting the weights could be your brain’s best friend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight‑lifting kicks off the release of chemicals such, as neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin‑like growth factor‑1 (IGF‑1), both of which nurture the growth and repair of neurons. At the same time, it tampers down inflammation, and helps sweep away the toxic protein clumps linked to Alzheimer’s. By building muscle resistance workouts, it also increases blood flow to the brain, which in turn protects brain tissue and prevents the shrinkage of memory‑related regions. In short strengthening muscles, seems to broadcast the right signals to the brain, making resistance training a form of brain protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Even helpful in those already diagnosed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training isn’t just a preventive measure; it can actually sharpen memory even in individuals already showing signs of cognitive decline. In studies of older adults with cognitive impairment, just a few months of resistance work has been linked to noticeable gains in both memory, and verbal fluency. The exercise appears to shield brain regions from degeneration, offering a drug‑free way to slow dementia’s progression. For patients and the people who care for them, this represents an uplifting discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Mixing up with cardio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though resistance training is finally getting its due, pairing it with cardio work appears to be the ideal brain‑boosting combo. A handful of studies have reported that people who mix weight‑lifting with cardio, experience improved memory and clearer thinking, than those who stick to cardio alone. Cardio revs up the heart and lungs, while strength work builds muscle, and nudges the brain’s repair systems. So a balanced routine that blends both seems the perfect bet for keeping the brain in shape as we grow older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How to start strength training&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting a resistance‑training routine can be straightforward and safe, for most adults. Some simple exercises can be done at home, using body weights, a set of resistance bands or a few light dumbbells. Focus on the core muscle groups-legs, arms, back and core. Try to fit in two moderate‑intensity resistance sessions each week, gradually increasing the weight or resistance, as strength improves. If you have underlying health conditions, it’s wise to consult a trainer or healthcare professional before beginning. Remember, consistency is essential for gaining all the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwJBVV95cUxNaWRkY3NVVHBqSmlGbmREQm5NV2JHdVkyOFNESlNuUVl1UmFXV1I4U0FtaXB4QnRMdFVWUlRHNWQzSTE2a0NWbmd6S1BDQm40YXhfdmdPc01tLUxjYVFoaUJPdmRwbzFiM0xKZU9DUFpOY3c3cjdVVUY1MWc5MWxVUFYydXRwa2ZjUXdla0pnQ09sMklEUkQ4MHNabm1xSzJGekhIN1ZRWVh6NHZ5YUFrM25GX0VoOHh1cHVLVWlONUZwRjFob0dfTjItRDBWZDlURzN2V2ZpSW9icFdTZVZVVHp6NFJibkhMYUNhODNHX1VkNVlFSTduRHI3cGpJOUFvZ3BRVVB3Ny03N1JDLVJ1Ykl5NjRsM2hoazFoSXk0dlJVZVR5WmoxNEpIWQ</guid></item><item><title>几十年后，科学家终于发现了泰诺的秘密机制- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/after-decades-scientists-have-finally-discovered-tylenols-secret-mechanism/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:08:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPa2lKb090VUpEeGdjZWtNWHE3WVBxNUNMZFlhdGpBZkhkWkItQVRiQmZPQVVpSk5FQWxqZU1XVEk2STBfenlTbjUwd1RkREE2TkNsRmpTdkRSRVo5d21mZi16bjZJQzJPOVdnWGhfQll3eEMtU3lNLUtDNGFLb1g3UnVKRTMzaGdPQnItcEtUVTBnVTdaaVE1TE9IbzVROU1XTVE</guid></item><item><title>锰是莱姆病的双刃剑- Phys.org</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-11-manganese-lyme-disease-edge-sword.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, Lyme disease has frustrated both physicians and patients alike. Caused by the corkscrew-shaped bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the infection, if left untreated, can linger for months, leading to fever, fatigue and painful inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;


										  

										
																																	&lt;p&gt;In a new study, Northwestern University and Uniformed Services University (USU) scientists have uncovered a surprising—and ironic—vulnerability in the hardy bacterium. By exploiting this vulnerability, researchers could help disarm B. burgdorferi, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/new+therapeutic+strategies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;new therapeutic strategies&lt;/a&gt; for Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Northwestern and USU team discovered that manganese, which helps shield B. burgdorferi against its host's immune system, is simultaneously also a crack in its armor. If B. burgdorferi is either starved of or overloaded with manganese, the bacteria become highly vulnerable to the host's immune system or treatments they would otherwise resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;i&gt;mBio&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work shows that manganese is a double-edged sword in Lyme disease," said Northwestern's Brian Hoffman, who co-led the study with USU's Michael Daly. "It's both Borrelia's armor and its weakness. If we can target the way it manages manganese, we could open doors to entirely new approaches for treating Lyme disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoffman is the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/molecular+biosciences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular biosciences&lt;/a&gt; at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. He also is a member of the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute and the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. Daly is an emeritus professor of pathology at USU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, the occurrence of Lyme disease has increased dramatically across North America and around the globe. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 476,000 people in the United States are diagnosed annually. Currently, there are no approved vaccines against the disease, and long-term use of antibiotics is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although antibiotics harm B. burgdorferi, they also kill beneficial gut bacteria," Daly said. "Lyme disease is transmitted through tick bites and—if not treated promptly—can cause lingering effects by attacking the patient's immune, circulatory and central nervous systems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of previous studies, Hoffman and Daly collaborated to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-12-conan-bacterium-combines-simple-metabolites.html"&gt;understand the role of manganese&lt;/a&gt; in Deinococcus radiodurans, a radiation-resistant bacteria known as "Conan the Bacterium" for its extraordinary ability to survive harsh conditions. Now, they wanted to see if manganese played a role in B. burgdorferi's defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the team used a new tool called electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging to characterize the atomic composition of manganese inside the living bacteria. To add even finer detail, the team harnessed electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to examine the atoms surrounding manganese. Together, the technologies created a molecular map, showing which forms of manganese were present, where they were located and how they changed under stress.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The "map" revealed a two-tier, manganese-based defense system comprising an enzyme called MnSOD and a pool of manganese metabolites. To withstand bombardment from the host's immune system, the bacteria first use MnSOD, which acts like a shield. If any oxygen radicals slip past this shield, they are met with the metabolite pool, which acts like a sponge to soak up and neutralize those toxic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrates the power of EPR and ENDOR spectroscopies for uncovering hidden biochemical mechanisms in pathogens," Hoffman said. "Without these tools, B. burgdorferi's defense system and weak spots would have remained invisible."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found the bacteria constantly juggle where to send the manganese—to the MnSOD enzymes or the metabolite pool. Too little manganese and the bacteria lose their defense mechanisms. But, as the microbes age, their metabolite pools dramatically shrink, leaving them exposed to damage and stress. At this point, too much manganese becomes toxic because the bacteria can no longer store it safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery holds potential for new Lyme disease therapies. Future drugs could starve the bacterium of manganese, disrupt its ability to form protective manganese complexes or even push it into toxic overload. Any of these approaches would leave B. burgdorferi wide open to attack by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By disrupting the delicate balance of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/manganese/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;manganese&lt;/a&gt; in B. burgdorferi, it may be possible to weaken the pathogen during infection," Daly said. "Manganese is an Achilles' heel of its defenses."&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how certain hobbies get labeled as "nerdy" or "weird," while others are considered totally normal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about this lately because I keep running into people who apologize for their interests, like they're confessing to some embarrassing secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I know it's boring, but I really love bird watching."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't judge me, but I spend my weekends doing puzzles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: those supposedly boring hobbies? They're often the ones that indicate a higher level of intelligence and cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you find deep satisfaction in any of these seven activities, there's a good chance you're operating at a higher cognitive level than most people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Reading fiction for pleasure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people will tell you they "should" read more, but genuinely loving fiction is different from feeling obligated to finish that bestseller everyone's talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who gets lost in novels, who thinks about characters like they're real people, who stays up too late because you need to know what happens next, you're exercising some serious cognitive muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newschool.edu/pressroom/pressreleases/2013/CastanoKidd.htm"&gt;Research from The New School&lt;/a&gt; found that reading literary fiction improves theory of mind, which is the ability to understand that others have beliefs, desires, and perspectives different from your own. This isn't just about empathy in some fuzzy, feel-good way. It's about sophisticated mental modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read fiction, you're constantly making predictions, tracking multiple characters' motivations, holding complex plot threads in your working memory, and interpreting ambiguous social situations. Your brain is doing intense work that looks like relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned this before, but I keep a stack of novels next to my bed, and I've noticed something interesting: the weeks when I'm reading fiction consistently are the weeks when I'm better at navigating tricky conversations and understanding subtext in my own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiction readers are essentially running social simulations in their heads. That's not escapism, that's training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Playing a musical instrument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to play an instrument is one of the most cognitively demanding activities humans can engage in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about what's actually happening when someone plays music: they're reading symbolic notation, translating it into motor commands, coordinating both hands independently, listening to the sound they're producing, comparing it to an internal model of how it should sound, and adjusting in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if they're playing with others, they're also tracking what everyone else is doing and adjusting to stay synchronized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.11.627938v1.full"&gt;Studies using brain imaging&lt;/a&gt; have shown that musicians have enhanced connectivity between brain regions, particularly between areas responsible for motor control and auditory processing. The corpus callosum, which connects the brain's two hemispheres, is often larger in musicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what I find most interesting: it's not just about the technical skills. Music requires you to think both analytically and creatively at the same time. You're following rules while also interpreting and expressing emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That dual processing, that ability to be both precise and expressive simultaneously, translates to enhanced problem-solving in completely unrelated domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you genuinely enjoy practicing scales or working through a difficult passage, your brain is thriving on complexity that most people find frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Engaging in strategy games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's chess, Go, complex board games, or strategic video games, if you love games that require planning several moves ahead, you're constantly exercising executive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These games aren't just about following rules. They require you to hold multiple possible future scenarios in your head simultaneously, evaluate them against each other, and make decisions based on incomplete information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes strategy games particularly interesting from a cognitive perspective is that they require you to model your opponent's thinking. You're not just planning your own strategy, you're thinking about what they think you're thinking, which requires sophisticated recursive reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think of gaming as a waste of time until I started paying attention to what was actually happening in my head during a complicated game. The mental workout is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find joy in the challenge of outthinking an opponent or solving a strategic puzzle, you're someone who thrives on cognitive complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Cooking elaborate meals from scratch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking might seem like a basic survival skill, but if you genuinely enjoy the process of creating complex dishes, you're engaging in a sophisticated form of problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about what goes into making a complicated recipe: you need to understand how different ingredients interact chemically, manage multiple timelines simultaneously, adjust for variables like humidity and altitude, taste and adjust seasoning based on sensory feedback, and adapt when something doesn't go according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8071848/#:~:text=Although%20not%20widely%20held%20within,fundamental%20to%20reaching%20psychosocial%20competence."&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that cooking activates multiple brain regions simultaneously. You're using procedural memory, sensory processing, fine motor control, planning, and creativity all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's something deeper happening too. When you cook, you're essentially running a complex project with multiple dependencies, deadlines, and quality standards. The cognitive skills involved are remarkably similar to those required in project management or software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started paying attention to this when I was developing recipes for my work. The mental process of figuring out how to veganize a traditional dish requires understanding the functional role each ingredient plays, then finding plant-based alternatives that fulfill those same functions. It's applied chemistry and creative problem-solving combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who finds meditation in chopping vegetables or satisfaction in perfecting a technique, you're drawn to the kind of hands-on problem-solving that requires both precision and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Learning new languages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find genuine enjoyment in learning languages, not just because you need to for work or travel, but because you love the process itself, you're demonstrating cognitive flexibility that most people lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language learning requires you to rewire fundamental patterns in your brain. You're not just memorizing vocabulary. You're learning to think in structures that might organize reality completely differently from your native language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3583091/#:~:text=Today%2C%20more%20of%20the%20world's,one%20language%20while%20using%20another."&gt;Studies have consistently shown&lt;/a&gt; that bilingual and multilingual individuals have enhanced executive function, better attention control, and improved ability to switch between tasks. The constant practice of inhibiting one language while using another strengthens cognitive control mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what fascinates me most is the metalinguistic awareness that develops. When you learn how another language works, you start noticing patterns in your own language that were previously invisible. You become aware of language as a system rather than just a transparent medium for thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of pattern recognition and systematic thinking transfers to other domains. People who enjoy language learning tend to be better at recognizing structural similarities across different fields and applying knowledge from one context to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Pursuing photography as a creative practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography might look like just pointing a camera and clicking, but if you're someone who genuinely loves the craft, you know it's about training yourself to see differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good photographers develop what's called "photographic eye," which is the ability to recognize visual patterns, anticipate moments, understand how three-dimensional reality will translate to a two-dimensional image, and make split-second compositional decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires simultaneously processing technical information (light, exposure, focus) while also thinking creatively about framing, storytelling, and emotional impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time walking around with my camera, and I've noticed that photography has changed how I perceive everything, even when I'm not shooting. I notice light quality, I unconsciously frame scenes, I'm more attuned to decisive moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That heightened perceptual awareness is a form of intelligence that doesn't show up on traditional tests but affects how you navigate and understand the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find joy in the challenge of capturing a fleeting moment or composing a compelling image, you're someone whose brain thrives on complex visual processing and aesthetic decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Writing for personal expression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you write regularly, not because you have to but because you genuinely enjoy it, you're engaging in one of the most cognitively demanding activities possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing requires you to translate nebulous thoughts into precise language, organize complex ideas into logical structures, anticipate how a reader will interpret your words, and revise based on that anticipation. You're essentially creating a mental simulation of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's something else happening too. When you write regularly, you're forced to clarify your own thinking. You can't hide fuzzy reasoning behind vague language when you're committing words to page. Writing makes intellectual sloppiness visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found that writing about topics forces me to understand them at a deeper level than I would otherwise. The act of explaining something reveals the gaps in my own knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who journals, writes essays, or works on creative projects because you find the process itself satisfying, you're training yourself to think more clearly and communicate more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence isn't just about solving math problems or memorizing facts. It's about curiosity, pattern recognition, cognitive flexibility, and the ability to engage deeply with complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hobbies on this list require sustained attention, tolerance for difficulty, and genuine intellectual engagement. They're not passive entertainment. They're active cognitive workouts that happen to be enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If several of these activities bring you real joy, not just obligation or the sense that you "should" do them, you're probably operating with cognitive abilities that exceed most people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smartest people I know don't necessarily have the highest test scores or the most degrees. They're the ones who remain genuinely curious, who pursue interests for their own sake, and who find satisfaction in activities that challenge them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your hobbies say a lot about how your brain is wired. If you're drawn to complexity, creativity, and continuous learning, trust that instinct. You're not wasting time. You're becoming smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning. Loyal readers may remember that in January, I donated blood for the first time, and it didn’t exactly go well. But I’m happy to say that I tried again yesterday and it was great. And then I got existential about how long ago January feels. What a year it’s been. Two weeks until Thanksgiving!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-washington-s-maha-summit"&gt;Inside Washington’s MAHA summit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was a strange mix of bedfellows at the “Official MAHA Summit” yesterday — biotech executives like George Yancopoulos alongside conservative wellness influencers like Russell Brand, plus the vice president and a slew of federal health officials. In particular, the appearance of JD Vance signaled to attendees how important their movement is to the future of the Republican party and the administration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t like taking medications,” Vance said, adopting the signature skepticism of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “I don’t take anything unless I absolutely have to.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-virus-is-only-a-plane-ride-away"&gt;‘The virus is only a plane ride away’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Germany’s public health agency revealed yesterday that wild poliovirus &lt;a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Aktuelles/Publikationen/Epidemiologisches-Bulletin/2025/46_25.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;had been detected&lt;/a&gt; in a sewage sample in the country. The virus likely arrived in a person infected in either Pakistan or Afghanistan, the only two countries where wild polioviruses still spread, said Mark Pallansch, a retired CDC virologist and polio expert who noted that as long as polioviruses continue to circulate anywhere, “the virus is only a plane ride away.” Paralysis occurs in only about one out of every 200 people who contract polio, so an infected but symptom-free traveler could easily serve as a vector.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The German health agency said there have been no human cases reported and rated the risk of that happening as low because of the country’s high polio vaccination rates. But this type of long-distance transmission has triggered cases elsewhere. In 2021-2022, wild polioviruses from Pakistan made their way to Southeast Africa, resulting in a case in Malawi and eight cases in Mozambique before transmission was stopped. — &lt;em&gt;Helen Branswell &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-convincing-evidence-on-the-link-between-ebv-and-lupus"&gt;‘Convincing evidence’ on the link between EBV and lupus&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have associated Epstein-Barr infection with the most common form of lupus in epidemiological studies in the past. But despite many theories about how the virus and autoimmune condition are connected, the exact mechanism has been unclear. New research, published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady0210" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, offers a new hypothesis: Epstein-Barr affects specific, rare B cells that drive autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By using sophisticated single-cell RNA sequencing tools designed to detect EBV+ B cells, investigators were able to see viral signatures that are usually invisible. They found lupus patients (11 of them) had far more of these B cells — about 25 per 10,000 B cells that were sequenced — than people in the healthy control group (10), who had about 1 per batch of 10,000 B cells. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alberto Ascherio, who helped prove the important connection between Epstein-Barr and multiple sclerosis, said the paper “apparently fills the gap by providing convincing evidence” of how EBV activates the immune system in lupus. — &lt;em&gt;Isabella Cueto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-moderna-s-rapid-rise-and-precarious-future"&gt;Inside Moderna’s rapid rise — and precarious future&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this week’s installment of STATus Report, reporters Jason Mast and Damian Garde discuss the “almost Forrest Gump-like entity” that is Moderna, and what could be in store for the company’s third act. Host Alex Hogan also chats with STAT Managing Editor Gideon Gil about what it was like to discover that the late, great STAT senior writer Sharon Begley had pre-written an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/07/james-watson-remembrance-from-dna-pioneer-to-pariah/"&gt;obituary to James Watson&lt;/a&gt;, the controversial scientist who died last week at 97.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Moderna conversation is based on &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/30/moderna-rise-fall-biotech-analysis-from-pandemic-rise-to-mrna-crash/"&gt;Jason’s amazing story&lt;/a&gt; from late October on how the company unraveled. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/13/status-report-moderna/" rel=""&gt;Watch now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-drug-could-help-fight-resistant-malaria-nbsp"&gt;A new drug could help fight resistant malaria &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malaria infections in parts of sub-Saharan Africa are showing increasing resistance to artemisinin-based therapies, a looming threat that could make the medicines less effective against the parasite. But a new drug from Novartis — one that works in an entirely different way — showed in a clinical trial that it worked just as well as standard treatments, giving the world an alternate strategy for treating one of the leading causes of death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is going to be music to the ears of sub-Saharan Africa,” said Abdoulaye Djimdé, a Malian malaria expert. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the Phase 3 KALUMA trial, the Novartis drug, known as GanLum, cured patients at the same high rates as artemisinin-based treatments (the study was designed to make sure the new drug was not inferior to the current approaches), and was also effective against parasites that had a mutation that makes them resistant to artemisinin. There were also signs that it might be able to cut transmission of the parasite. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sujata Vaidyanathan, the head of Novartis’ global health development unit, told reporters the company is now preparing for a regulatory submission. She said it was too early to discuss pricing, but Novartis largely sells its malaria treatments for no profit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key question is how GanLum should be used. The artemisinin-based medicines are still broadly working, so there shouldn’t be an immediate switchover, said George Jagoe of the Medicines for Malaria Venture. But he likened it to having a fire extinguisher on hand for when an emergency occurs — in this case, when there’s enough resistance that the current drugs stop working. — &lt;em&gt;Andrew Joseph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-digital-divide-keeping-seniors-out-of-snap"&gt;The digital divide keeping seniors out of SNAP&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/politics/government-shutdown-vote-trump.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the shutdown ends&lt;/a&gt;, the status of SNAP remains a bit complicated. But even if things go back to normal, many older people entitled to benefits will continue to be locked out, writes policy researcher Javaid Iqbal Sofi in a new First Opinion essay. Roughly 13 million older adults qualify for SNAP, yet fewer than 4 million actually receive benefits. And Sofi believes that for many of them, technology could be the hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enrollment in SNAP increasingly requires online applications, and new eligibility rules will create new documentation requirements that increasingly must be submitted online. For people of any age without reliable internet, smartphones, or digital skills, increasing digital requirements often block access to benefits. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/13/snap-benefits-online-seniors-access/" rel=""&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; from Sofi about the digital barriers, why “go to the library” isn’t good advice, and what can be done instead.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;More Americans are receiving computed tomography (CT) scans than ever before, and while this technology &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/ct-scan-saves-lives"&gt;can save lives&lt;/a&gt;, some scientists are concerned that low doses of ionizing radiation could increase  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="181232" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, at an individual level, the theoretical risk of developing cancer from a CT scan is &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/medical-x-ray-imaging/what-are-radiation-risks-ct"&gt;thought to be very low&lt;/a&gt;, if it exists at all. Patients should not hesitate to undergo these tests if they are considered medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the number of CT examinations performed annually in the US has increased by more than 30 percent since 2007, and researchers suggest that unwarranted tests are exposing the population to unnecessary radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-are-hacking-bacteria-to-fight-cancer-then-self-destruct"&gt;Scientists Are Hacking Bacteria to Fight Cancer, Then Self-Destruct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in April, a team in the US and the UK predicted that low levels of ionizing radiation from CT scans could theoretically account for 5 percent of all new cancer diagnoses in the US. CT scans conducted in 2023 could be responsible for an estimated 103,000 future cases of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's based on some assumptions and historical data from high radiation events, but if right, it would put CT scans on par with other significant &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/radioactive-waste-exposed-children-in-missouri-to-cancer-risks-study-finds"&gt;risk factors for cancer&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-why-every-sip-of-alcohol-increases-your-risk-of-cancer"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, at least at a population level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CT is frequently lifesaving, yet its potential harms are often overlooked, and even very small cancer risks will lead to a significant number of future cancers given the tremendous volume of CT use in the United States," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the international team of analysts, led by epidemiologist Rebecca Smith-Bindman from the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, these are just theoretical risks, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth considering. While scientists know that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2203/dose-response.07-013.Brooks"&gt;high doses of radiation cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6447446/"&gt;conclusive evidence&lt;/a&gt; to link low-level radiation to cancer is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential association is &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/prehospital-and-disaster-medicine/article/risk-of-cancer-from-ct-scans-and-other-sources-of-lowdose-radiation-a-critical-appraisal-of-methodologic-quality/23464B0D825CD456741B77476F9997F7"&gt;mostly based&lt;/a&gt; on long-term studies of atomic bomb survivors and those exposed to nuclear power plant meltdowns. For instance, in a group of &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging"&gt;25,000 Hiroshima survivors&lt;/a&gt;, who received a dose of ionizing radiation on par with three or more CT scans, there was a slight but significant increase in cancer risk across a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether those results extend to CT scans remains &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2672242/"&gt;hotly debated&lt;/a&gt;, and the theoretical risks must be weighed against the benefits of this technology, which can now alert patients and doctors to a whole variety of hidden diseases and injuries with very low doses of radiation (about the same amount &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org.au/iheard/can-radiation-from-medical-tests-cause-cancer"&gt;you absorb from your environment&lt;/a&gt; over three years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171762" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171762" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-642x444.jpg" alt="A patient undergoing a CT scan, with a technician present" class="size-medium wp-image-171762" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-642x444.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-600x415.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-768x532.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171762" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The theoretical risks of CT scans must be weighed against the benefits.

Using statistics from 2016 to 2022, researchers predicted 93 million CT examinations were carried out in 2023, on roughly 62 million patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the associated radiation risks, the team estimates that CT scans in 2023 may be tied to 103,000 future cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To empirically quantify lifetime risk would require decades-long follow-up studies of very large populations," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;acknowledge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, their results suggest that some people may be more susceptible to cancer from low-dose ionizing radiation than others.

In support, the World Health Organization (WHO) is deploying an initial team of responders and delivering medical supplies to assist in the ongoing efforts to determine the cause of infection and halt further transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, eight suspected cases have been reported. Laboratory testing is ongoing at the Ethiopia Public Health Institute to determine the exact cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the national authorities, WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of 11 technical officers with experience in responding to viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks to help strengthen disease surveillance, investigation, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, clinical care, outbreak response coordination and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is also providing essential supplies including personal protective equipment for health workers and infection-prevention supplies, as well as a rapidly deployable isolation tent to bolster clinical care and management capacity. Additional technical capacity is being mobilized to support the overall response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has also released US$ 300 000 from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to provide immediate support to the national authorities.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral haemorrhagic fevers refer to a group of epidemic prone diseases that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. They include Marburg and Ebola virus diseases, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific signs and symptoms vary by the type of viral haemorrhagic fever, but initial signs and symptoms often include marked fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, loss of strength and exhaustion. All cases of acute viral haemorrhagic fever syndrome whether single or in clusters, should be immediately notified without waiting for the causal agent to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Many of these cohorts are large biobanks linked with lifetime medical records in national patient registers, including iPSYCH, FinnGen, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), the UKB and the EstBB (cohort details in &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02396-8#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Methods&lt;/a&gt;). This study was approved by the Swedish ethical review authority (case no. 2023-03073), and each cohort was approved by the relevant institutional review boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4"&gt;Phenotypes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expanded our previous effort of harmonizing the register-based phenotypes of MDD, age at first diagnosis and its outcomes in the three Scandinavian countries to other Nordic countries with similar registers&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 15" title="Pasman, J.

Using national patient registers, we first extracted information on patient diagnoses of MDD using ICD-10 code F32 (depressive episode) or F33 (recurrent depressive episodes), with the exclusion criteria of a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (ICD-10 codes: F30/F31/F32/F33, F20/F23.1/F23.2/F25) (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02396-8#MOESM4"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;), resulting in a total combined number of MDD cases in the Nordic countries of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 151,582. Our previous research revealed a high genetic correlation (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.95) between AAO and age at first diagnosis for MDD&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 16" title="Harder, A. et al.

Therefore, we derived the age at first diagnosis for the MDD patient population and used that as a proxy for AAO for the definition of eoMDD and loMDD. The cutoffs were chosen based on careful review of the literature and the empirical registry data from Sweden. Previous meta-analysis reported that the median AAO for depressive disorder is around age 30, with the 25th and 75th percentile at age 21 and 44, respectively&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 15" title="Pasman, J.

Thus, we considered individuals with their first psychiatric specialist treatment contact for MDD at or before age 25 (approximate to the 25th percentile of the AAO distribution at age 20–21) as cases with eoMDD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 46,708); cases with loMDD were those with their first specialist treatment contact for MDD at or after age 50 (approximate to the 25th percentile of the AAO distribution at age 44–45; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 37,168). Controls were individuals without a registered diagnosis of MDD, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Because of the differences in cohort design, controls were matched to cases for the population-based cohorts of EstBB, FinnGen, MoBa and UKB. The Danish and Swedish cohorts, which used case–cohort and case–control designs, did not require control matching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec5"&gt;Software containers for federated analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure transparent and reproducible analyses of data across sites, we developed software containers and accompanying codes for data processing and analyses (for example, GWAS, PRS, LDSC) and distributed the containers across the study sites.

To convert the SNP-based heritability to the liability scale, we calculated the sample prevalence of cases in the meta-analysis; for population prevalence, we used a lifetime estimate of diagnosed MDD of 16% (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Kessler, R.

To obtain corresponding estimates for eoMDD and loMDD, we estimated the proportion of cases with MDD who had an early-onset or a late-onset diagnosis in the largest population samples (EstBB and FinnGen) and took that as a percentage of the whole MDD prevalence estimate, resulting in a population estimate of 6.2% for eoMDD and 3.2% for loMDD. Acknowledging that these estimates are approximations, we provided SNP heritability estimates for a range of prevalence estimates (±50% around the point estimates).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To estimate genetic correlations with other traits, we used phenotypes from publicly available summary statistics, selecting important psychiatric disorders and key health determinants and outcomes, including suicide, body mass index, educational attainment, substance use, mortality and cardiovascular disease (GWAS sources in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02396-8#MOESM4"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10"&gt;SBayesS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using SBayesS&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Zeng, J. et al.

Genomic SEM is an extension of SEM whereby GWAS summary statistics are used to capture the ‘observed’ traits in the model so that the genetic architecture underlying the multivariate relationships between traits can be modeled. Genomic SEM relies on LDSC to estimate genetic correlations and is robust to any amount of sample overlap. We modeled the association of the MDD subtypes with other related phenotypes that have been well studied in the literature, including a range of psychiatric disorders, important health determinants, CVD and mortality (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02396-8#MOESM4"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;). First, we compared the size and significance of the genetic correlations of the two subtypes (eoMDD and loMDD) with the other phenotypes. Next, we assessed the subtype-specific contribution to the other phenotypes by controlling for the other subtype (for example, we investigated the relationship between eoMDD and suicide attempt after controlling for loMDD). Thus, the unique contribution of each can be gauged while controlling for their shared variance. The genetic overlap between eoMDD and loMDD was moderate; therefore, the concern for strong bias through multicollinearity was limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the analyses of genetic overlap, we used MR to assess whether the MDD subtypes were causally associated with selected health outcomes (risk factors, mortality and CVD; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02396-8#MOESM4"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;). We did not include psychiatric outcomes because of the high likelihood of pleiotropy. Assuming that alleles are randomly distributed in the population (in a manner akin to experimental randomization), MR uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to capture a trait (‘exposure’). If the genetic variants are robust, non-pleiotropic instruments for the exposure and there is no direct association with the outcome or an unmeasured confounder, this provides support for a potential causal effect of the exposure. We conducted main and sensitivity analyses as implemented in the TwoSampleMR R package&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Hemani, G. et al.

For interpretation, we focused on effect consistency across tests, rather than &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. Still, to give an indication of the extent of the multiple testing burden, we report significance according to false discovery rate-corrected &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values (Benjamini–Hochberg method).

Although we were not able to remove potential sample overlap from the analyses (LOO analyses would leave the exposure GWAS underpowered), this should not be a large threat to the validity of our results.

However, there was overlap in the instrument sets for both traits. Although only one SNP is present in both sets, many had LD partners in common. Therefore, we performed another sensitivity analysis using a single instrument SNP for each trait. We selected the genome-wide significant SNP that had the largest &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value for the other trait (filtering on a minor allele frequency &amp;gt; 0.10). For eoMDD, we used rs7622302 residing in the &lt;i&gt;DAG1&lt;/i&gt; gene on chromosome 3, with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.98 for loMDD. This instrument explained 2.8% of the variance (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in eoMDD.

Although power was expected to be lower in these single-SNP analyses, pleiotropy was also reduced; instrument strength was still sufficient (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; = 30.7 for eoMDD and &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; = 30.1 for loMDD) and the contrast between eoMDD and loMDD was maximized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec13"&gt;Polygenic risk scores&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRS were calculated using LDpred2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 52" title="Privé, F., Arbel, J. &amp;amp; Vilhjálmsson, B.

For this analysis, the first four questions were scored on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 indicating the participant had never felt or experienced this, and 4 indicating the participant felt or experienced it often). The fifth question had binary responses (no/yes) corresponding to values of 0 or 2.

As this evidence stacks up, scientists have accelerated calls for a vaccine that targets the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-735484" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we now better understand how this fastidious virus is responsible for autoimmune diseases, I think it’s time to figure out how to prevent it,” said Dr. Anca Askanase, clinical director of the Lupus Center at Columbia University, who wasn’t involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd42ea" class="body-graf"&gt;In lupus patients, an autoimmune attack can result in extreme fatigue, joint pain and skin rashes. In rare cases, the disease may lead to fatal or life-threatening issues such as kidney damage, or weaken the immune system so the body can’t fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b10a42" class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists have long suspected a link between Epstein-Barr and lupus, but the exact connection had remained elusive. Dr. William Robinson, a co-author of the new study and chief of the division of immunology and rheumatology at Stanford University, said his new findings solve a major piece of that puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ec1d19" class="body-graf"&gt;“From our perspective, it’s the key, missing mechanistic link,” Robinson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6f7c1c" class="body-graf"&gt;“We think it applies to all lupus cases,” he added. Hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. are living with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-72aeb5" class="body-graf"&gt;But Hoang Nguyen, assistant vice president of research at the Lupus Research Alliance, said it’s too soon to know if the mechanism is behind every case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-36a76f" class="body-graf"&gt;“Although the evidence is intriguing and promising, more evidence is needed to demonstrate that the link to EBV applies to all lupus,” Nguyen said. The alliance is a private funder of lupus research and contributed grant funding to Robinson’s study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-860ed7" class="body-graf"&gt;An infection withe Epstein-Barr virus does not necessarily cause symptoms, especially among children, though the virus is also the most common cause of mononucleosis (often referred to as mono).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4721a" class="body-graf"&gt;It's primarily transmitted by saliva from kissing or sharing drinks, food, utensils or toothbrushes. After someone is infected, the virus lingers permanently in the body, where it usually remains inactive — though not always. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b388f" class="body-graf"&gt;The new study is not the first to tie Epstein-Barr to autoimmune issues. Past research has &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/study-suggests-epstein-barr-virus-may-cause-multiple-sclerosis" target="_blank"&gt;linked it to multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;. Though not the sole trigger of MS, the virus may be part of a chain of events that leads to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6ef538" class="body-graf"&gt;Robinson said a pathway similar to the one described in his new study could also lead to other autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease, but more research is needed to tease that out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e018b2" class="body-graf"&gt;Of course, the vast majority of people who contract Epstein-Barr do not go on to get lupus, MS or any other autoimmune disease. Robinson said it’s possible that only certain strains of Epstein-Barr trigger autoimmune reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d9dbd6" class="body-graf"&gt;To determine the causal link between Epstein-Barr and lupus, Robinson and his co-authors focused on B cells — white blood cells that help fight off infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c0c09a" class="body-graf"&gt;Even in healthy individuals, Epstein-Barr lies dormant in a tiny portion of B cells. But those virus-containing B cells are far more prevalent in lupus patients, who have a 25 times higher share of them, according to the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8731d" class="body-graf"&gt;The study also highlights a type of protein called antinuclear antibodies, which bind to the nucleus of cells and are one of the hallmarks of lupus. The researchers found that Epstein-Barr infects and reprograms B cells to produce antinuclear antibodies that attack the body’s own tissue, thereby causing lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2cba9" class="body-graf"&gt;Robinson said the findings go hand-in-hand with some other theories about what causes lupus. For instance, scientists suspect that a person’s genetics or hormones can predispose them to the disease, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f2aeb" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07627-2" target="_blank"&gt;study published last year in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt; also found that people with lupus have too much of a particular T cell — another type of white blood cell — that’s associated with cell damage and too little of another T cell associated with repair. Robinson said the pathway described in his study could &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/scientists-say-identified-root-cause-lupus-rcna160862" target="_blank"&gt;activate that T cell response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7edf1" class="body-graf"&gt;The new research points to a few potential options for lupus treatment, according to Robinson, who is the co-founder of two drug development companies exploring treatments for autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27444c" class="body-graf"&gt;Many of the current medications given to ease lupus symptoms, such as corticosteroids, broadly focus on reducing inflammation. Robinson said future therapeutics could specifically target B cells infected with Epstein-Barr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bdd93a" class="body-graf"&gt;But an Epstein-Barr vaccine — several of which are in clinical trials — could someday stop infections in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33bf99" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Vaccination to protect people against ever being infected by EBV would be the ultimate, fundamental solution,” Robinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOeTRZd0ZiX3F6ZU40LVUwN3VPZ2twRlV1Rzh4cWFrbUstMzloSEh6a1dnbHRBUWpmVW42SF9Lazg0aGNlakZoeVoxdHlWMEhKVVFfY0xDNnBXNVVWcGFfUVRiQlp3MzFWSlNJcG5YM25lQkF5RUdOOG9kQThmaFV0Y21XQmJIa0tOZlJFMDdrUnJ3U2pT0gFWQVVfeXFMTnh1UGJXWHg0SXc1YnZzUnZmTmpQUThWZ1FGbXV1cjV3M25FYUd3NEhEc1dhbWRzZDdkX2VjbkUxa1VIZV9sNVpGR2xsbjFCU3dmNHJiNFE</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州神经外科医生分享与更年期相关的鲜为人知的认知风险： “雌激素保护脑细胞免受……” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/michigan-neurosurgeon-shares-lesser-known-cognitive-risk-linked-to-menopause-101763023377236.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyMainDiv" class="fullStory tfStory current videoStory story__detail storyAf101763023377236 " data-vars-storyid="101763023377236" data-story-section="lifestyle" data-story-subsection="health" data-vars-author="Eshana Saha" data-premium-story="false" data-performance-type="not-set" data-story-title="Michigan neurosurgeon shares lesser-known cognitive risk linked to menopause: ‘Oestrogen protects brain cells from…’"&gt; &lt;p class="htEchoTopPageBanner dHide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="stickyCard"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1 class="hdg1"&gt;Michigan neurosurgeon shares lesser-known cognitive risk linked to menopause: ‘Oestrogen protects brain cells from…’&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;div class="actionDiv flexElm topTime"&gt; &lt;p class="dateTime secTime storyPage"&gt;Published on: Nov 13, 2025 02:44 pm IST &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="googleFollow mHide"&gt; &lt;button class="htEchoShareBarDesk"&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2 class="sortDec"&gt;While common symptoms of menopause like heat flashes, mood swings and fatigue are widely discussed, Dr Jagannath draws attention to how it affects the brain.&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div class="storyDetails taboola-readmore"&gt; &lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/michigan-neurosurgeon-shares-lesser-known-cognitive-risk-linked-to-menopause-101763023377236.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/menopause" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Menopause"&gt;Menopause &lt;/a&gt;marks a major transition in a woman’s life, often accompanied by symptoms like hot flashes, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiac-surgeon-shares-7-subtle-signs-of-heart-failure-that-most-people-ignore-until-too-late-fatigue-bloating-more-101762677511972.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fatigue"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, and mood swings.

Dr Jagannathan discusses the crucial role of oestrogen in cognitive function - and how its decline during menopause can affect the brain. He explains, “Oestrogen isn’t just a reproductive hormone - it’s a neuroprotective shield. It helps regulate blood flow, reduce inflammation, and protect brain cells from stress. So when oestrogen levels drop, that protection weakens.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hidden health risks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Dr Jagannathan, the decline in oestrogen plays a major role in raising cognitive health risks for women after menopause. Consequently, the likelihood of the following issues rises during and after this stage:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Silent strokes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Memory decline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Increased risk of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/festivals/neuroscientist-shares-3-major-risk-factors-for-developing-alzheimers-disease-vitamin-deficiency-inflammation-more-101762864342370.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Alzheimer’s"&gt;Alzheimer’s &lt;/a&gt;and cognitive fog&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/13/original/menopause_graphic_1763023653076.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Dr Jagannathan highlights 4 ways you can reduce the risk of cognitive decline during menopause.(Image generated via ChatGPT)" title="Dr Jagannathan highlights 4 ways you can reduce the risk of cognitive decline during menopause.(Image generated via ChatGPT)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Dr Jagannathan highlights 4 ways you can reduce the risk of cognitive decline during menopause.(Image generated via ChatGPT)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to reduce risks?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The neurosurgeon states, “Your brain health is deeply connected to your hormonal health. And understanding that connection could be what protects you decades down the road.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Jagannathan notes that while oestrogen-related cognitive decline is a biological repercussion of menopause, it can be managed effectively with a few simple lifestyle adjustments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Control blood pressure and cholesterol since your brain’s vessels depend on it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stay physically and mentally active.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prioritise restorative &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/mumbai-orthopaedic-surgeon-says-women-actually-need-more-sleep-than-men-and-science-backs-it-20-minutes-more-101763017474256.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="sleep"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Talk to your doctor about hormone and vascular health because early monitoring matters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it could “reverse the hard won gains”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, $5.9bn was available for prevention, diagnosis and treatment, far below the annual target of $22bn by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Declines in the global burden of TB and progress in testing, treatment, social protection and research are all welcome news after years of setbacks, but progress is not victory,” the WHO chief said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that TB continues to claim over a million lives each year despite being preventable and curable is simply unconscionable,” Tedros added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although TB deaths in 2024 were 29 percent lower than those recorded in 2015, the WHO had hoped to reduce this figure by 75 percent by 2025 and 90 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of deaths could even rise in the years ahead, warned Tereza Kasaeva, director of WHO’s division for tuberculosis, HIV and related infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long-term cuts to international donor funding could result in up to 2 million additional deaths and 10 million people falling ill with TB between 2025 and 2035,” Kasaeva said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency was dealt a significant financial blow when the United States withdrew from it in January, forcing a 21 percent cut to its proposed spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision by US President Donald Trump’s administration to slash foreign aid, particularly from the US Agency for International Development, has also raised fears about global TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, critical international aid helped to prevent 3.65 million deaths from the disease, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 08:37:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

The study found that 11% of men died compared to 5% of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The causes of this condition involve emotionally stressful situations, like loss of a loved one or a traumatic event. It can also involve something &lt;em class=" "&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; stressful, like having a car accident or major surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;One factor that can play a crucial role is having a support system. Experts say men struggle more with recovery due to less social support for managing stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Social isolation and loneliness on our health is as powerful as things like smoking, high blood pressure, obesity," said Dr. Richard S. Schwartz, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The best advice? Interventional cardiologist Dr. Prakash Balan says be mindful and pay attention to your symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you're having symptoms, get them checked out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Symptoms include low blood pressure and irregular heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors say people often mistake broken heart syndrome with a heart attack because it can mimic a heart attack with symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If you experience those symptoms, it's crucial to seek immediate medical care and go to a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The difference between the two is that a heart attack is generally caused by a complete, or near-complete, blockage of a heart artery. In broken heart syndrome, the heart arteries are not blocked, but blood flow in the heart's arteries is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors might prescribe treatments, but stress management and getting social support are also a part of the healing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="uvrxY zOGtW "&gt;Copyright © 2025 KABC Television, LLC.

At just 17, and playing at one of the top soccer academies in the US, she couldn’t afford to take time off, but something felt wrong. Play on, urged her watching coach, and Ladner did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that evening, a tingling sensation crept up from her ankles to her knees, then her legs went numb. It’s just dehydration, doctors at a busy &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-hampshire/index.html" id="mol-e4d6ee90-bfcc-11f0-9676-938fb839d8a8" class=""&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; emergency department assured her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the next morning, when Ladner woke up, she couldn’t move her legs at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was terrified,’ she told Daily Mail. ‘It was the worst feeling I have ever experienced.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed back to the hospital, where doctors tested the reflexes in her knee, only to find her leg didn't move. They then ordered a spinal tap, a test used to check for complications in the body's nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then came the &lt;span&gt;devastating diagnosis: Ladner had Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a rare disorder that affects one in 100,000 people, in which the immune system attacks the nerves, sometimes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14805541/Pins-needles-sign-fit-healthy-Luke-31-struck-surprisingly-common-condition-left-paralysed.html"&gt;leaving patients permanently paralyzed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and struggling to breathe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ladner, now 25, said: 'They were unsure if I was ever going to be able to walk again. They said I might never be able to stand and walk by myself again, or play soccer. [But] I was committed to playing soccer, I had planned my whole life around it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was May 2017, and Ladner was planning to attend Dartmouth College to play soccer after high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unwilling to accept the prognosis doctors gave her, Ladner worked tirelessly over eight months to regain her ability to move her legs, painstakingly relearning how to climb out of bed, walk, run and, finally, play soccer again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And ever since then, she has never taken her health for granted, becoming a marathon runner and now completing her second New York City marathon earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Relly Ladner, now 22 years old and living in New York City, started to suffer a tingling in her legs while playing with her soccer team, shown above, at age 17 years. Ladner is shown by the red circle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ladner said: 'I felt scared. I felt kind of helpless when doctors told me I might never walk again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But then, at the same time, I felt like, motivated, from that, that it was going to get better, and I was going to defy those odds and that, if anyone was going to be able to do it, it was going to be me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After receiving her diagnosis of GBS, Ladner's&lt;span&gt; situation worsened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told Daily Mail: 'It was spreading quickly [the numbness]. They wanted it to stop, because... it can spread all the way up [your body], you can become paralyzed everywhere, and people have to be on ventilators.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GBS is a rare autoimmune disorder where immune system cells misfire and target the peripheral nerves in the arms and legs, causing them to stop transmitting signals properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, patients feel a tingling or numbing sensation in the affected limbs before losing the ability to move altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear what causes the condition, but doctors say it may be triggered by the immune system misfiring after attacking a common viral infection that the patient may not even know they had, such as the flu, Covid or Epstein Barr Virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Proteins in the viruses are similar to those on nerve cells, scientists say, which can confuse the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The tingling turned to numbness and, by the next morning, she was no longer able to walk. Ladner was rushed to the hospital, shown, for treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a rare reaction, however, with only about 3,000 to 6,000 cases diagnosed in the US every year. The disease can strike at any age, but it is slightly more common among older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 80 percent of GBS patients are able to walk independently six months after their diagnosis, while 60 percent fully recover their muscle abilities within a year, according to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20363006"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians say many patients recover because of the intensive treatments offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About five to 10 percent&lt;span&gt; have very delayed or incomplete recovery, suffering from complications including paralysis, while less than two percent die as a result of the condition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Ladner's case, doctors infused the patient with &lt;/span&gt;immunoglobulin, proteins in the blood that fight infections, from a healthy donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although it is not a cure for GBS, physicians say it may help because the healthy plasma could contain substances that neutralize antibodies that are causing the body to attack its own nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight hours later, Ladner had a second infusion, and said that the numbness then stopped advancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with GBS, she suffered from aspetic meningitis, inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. This is not caused by GBS, but can be triggered as a result of blood plasma infusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite the odds and concerns she would never walk again, she overcame them and has now run in three marathons. She is pictured above while competing in the New York City marathon this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the treatments worked and her numbness started to ease, Ladner, her doctors and her family breathed a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while the paralysis wasn't advancing anymore, the virus had severely damaged the nerves in her legs, leaving her with almost no movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She remained in the hospital for several weeks, during which doctors worked to help her gradually regain the ability to climb out of bed and walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was then transferred to a rehabilitation facility, where she remained for several more months working with physical therapists, who helped her walk, run, climb and even kick a soccer ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was discharged in January 2018, eight months after her symptoms first emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, Ladner says her immune system remains 'weak', and that she frequently contracts viruses like the common cold or flu, but that her athletic ability is much improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as returning to the soccer field, she also found a passion for running after moving to New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joining New York Road Runners, a nonprofit that promotes running to boost health, she has now competed in three marathons and hopes to do more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She completed the Nashville marathon in April last year, and has now run the New York City marathon twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She still thinks back to her condition, however, fearing that it could return, but also using it to help motivate her to run more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said:&lt;span&gt; 'People always ask me, why am I motivated to run? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'And I really think that it's my like, having had Guillain-Barré, and having been told that I was never going to... be able to walk again, that motivates me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because, you know, there was a time when I was laying in a hospital bed unable to walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And so, even on the days when I'm like, not motivated, or when the training gets hard...  I think back to a time when I would have wished that I could have been doing what I am doing now. It helps me and pushes me to finish.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 05:16:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNWFFYVzNpYk9zTWFBVEhfNnMyQTJCSVlFYmZwb0F2R1ltQkxlblhxcmZ0OGJSZEYzRmZ1ZXhIYU5IdUtZX25GUjhHUVdzaEN0OVNDNFFoTWg1OFVyUzRvQmE5Z3ktbTI2VmlyUHA2ZzhadWtXUzkxQW1hck45eW04eFpCMU9EVkh4NTJ1RlA1UTVtMFAtUGxNUHE5RkpSZXJq0gGmAUFVX3lxTE8wZUJ4V2RCMzlsSG03NGhpWlp2TWhXZnhQdGd3SFVULVoza0hmOTg0RDBnVXNpS0p2el9SQ09WeEo0QVZhTzI0UjF6WGhId1p6eUxrck5obmgtNlFZbUU2aHNsbi10T3lDNDNtRTRCbUlTb0ZpVXZrWWc1QlRuMkJIYUhiQ2Z2QmI3LUw4cmFhRHEyNmVUY3RCbVIwdkRtVlFkaWstcUE</guid></item><item><title>告诉《华盛顿邮报》：您是否正在为更年期或围绝经期而苦苦挣扎？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/12/menopause-perimenopause-experiences/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PTNO4LJZ3JAYHNRZC6Z7KDA3YQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Washington Post wants to hear about your experiences navigating health care with perimenopause and menopause.
