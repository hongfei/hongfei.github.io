In support, the World Health Organization (WHO) is deploying an initial team of responders and delivering medical supplies to assist in the ongoing efforts to determine the cause of infection and halt further transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, eight suspected cases have been reported. Laboratory testing is ongoing at the Ethiopia Public Health Institute to determine the exact cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the national authorities, WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of 11 technical officers with experience in responding to viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks to help strengthen disease surveillance, investigation, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, clinical care, outbreak response coordination and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is also providing essential supplies including personal protective equipment for health workers and infection-prevention supplies, as well as a rapidly deployable isolation tent to bolster clinical care and management capacity. Additional technical capacity is being mobilized to support the overall response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has also released US$ 300 000 from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to provide immediate support to the national authorities.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral haemorrhagic fevers refer to a group of epidemic prone diseases that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. They include Marburg and Ebola virus diseases, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific signs and symptoms vary by the type of viral haemorrhagic fever, but initial signs and symptoms often include marked fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, loss of strength and exhaustion. All cases of acute viral haemorrhagic fever syndrome whether single or in clusters, should be immediately notified without waiting for the causal agent to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As this evidence stacks up, scientists have accelerated calls for a vaccine that targets the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-735484" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we now better understand how this fastidious virus is responsible for autoimmune diseases, I think it’s time to figure out how to prevent it,” said Dr. Anca Askanase, clinical director of the Lupus Center at Columbia University, who wasn’t involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd42ea" class="body-graf"&gt;In lupus patients, an autoimmune attack can result in extreme fatigue, joint pain and skin rashes. In rare cases, the disease may lead to fatal or life-threatening issues such as kidney damage, or weaken the immune system so the body can’t fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b10a42" class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists have long suspected a link between Epstein-Barr and lupus, but the exact connection had remained elusive. Dr. William Robinson, a co-author of the new study and chief of the division of immunology and rheumatology at Stanford University, said his new findings solve a major piece of that puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ec1d19" class="body-graf"&gt;“From our perspective, it’s the key, missing mechanistic link,” Robinson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6f7c1c" class="body-graf"&gt;“We think it applies to all lupus cases,” he added. Hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. are living with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-72aeb5" class="body-graf"&gt;But Hoang Nguyen, assistant vice president of research at the Lupus Research Alliance, said it’s too soon to know if the mechanism is behind every case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-36a76f" class="body-graf"&gt;“Although the evidence is intriguing and promising, more evidence is needed to demonstrate that the link to EBV applies to all lupus,” Nguyen said. The alliance is a private funder of lupus research and contributed grant funding to Robinson’s study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-860ed7" class="body-graf"&gt;An infection withe Epstein-Barr virus does not necessarily cause symptoms, especially among children, though the virus is also the most common cause of mononucleosis (often referred to as mono).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4721a" class="body-graf"&gt;It's primarily transmitted by saliva from kissing or sharing drinks, food, utensils or toothbrushes. After someone is infected, the virus lingers permanently in the body, where it usually remains inactive — though not always. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b388f" class="body-graf"&gt;The new study is not the first to tie Epstein-Barr to autoimmune issues. Past research has &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/study-suggests-epstein-barr-virus-may-cause-multiple-sclerosis" target="_blank"&gt;linked it to multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;. Though not the sole trigger of MS, the virus may be part of a chain of events that leads to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6ef538" class="body-graf"&gt;Robinson said a pathway similar to the one described in his new study could also lead to other autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease, but more research is needed to tease that out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e018b2" class="body-graf"&gt;Of course, the vast majority of people who contract Epstein-Barr do not go on to get lupus, MS or any other autoimmune disease. Robinson said it’s possible that only certain strains of Epstein-Barr trigger autoimmune reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d9dbd6" class="body-graf"&gt;To determine the causal link between Epstein-Barr and lupus, Robinson and his co-authors focused on B cells — white blood cells that help fight off infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c0c09a" class="body-graf"&gt;Even in healthy individuals, Epstein-Barr lies dormant in a tiny portion of B cells. But those virus-containing B cells are far more prevalent in lupus patients, who have a 25 times higher share of them, according to the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8731d" class="body-graf"&gt;The study also highlights a type of protein called antinuclear antibodies, which bind to the nucleus of cells and are one of the hallmarks of lupus. The researchers found that Epstein-Barr infects and reprograms B cells to produce antinuclear antibodies that attack the body’s own tissue, thereby causing lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2cba9" class="body-graf"&gt;Robinson said the findings go hand-in-hand with some other theories about what causes lupus. For instance, scientists suspect that a person’s genetics or hormones can predispose them to the disease, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f2aeb" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07627-2" target="_blank"&gt;study published last year in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt; also found that people with lupus have too much of a particular T cell — another type of white blood cell — that’s associated with cell damage and too little of another T cell associated with repair. Robinson said the pathway described in his study could &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/scientists-say-identified-root-cause-lupus-rcna160862" target="_blank"&gt;activate that T cell response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7edf1" class="body-graf"&gt;The new research points to a few potential options for lupus treatment, according to Robinson, who is the co-founder of two drug development companies exploring treatments for autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27444c" class="body-graf"&gt;Many of the current medications given to ease lupus symptoms, such as corticosteroids, broadly focus on reducing inflammation. Robinson said future therapeutics could specifically target B cells infected with Epstein-Barr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bdd93a" class="body-graf"&gt;But an Epstein-Barr vaccine — several of which are in clinical trials — could someday stop infections in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33bf99" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Vaccination to protect people against ever being infected by EBV would be the ultimate, fundamental solution,” Robinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOeTRZd0ZiX3F6ZU40LVUwN3VPZ2twRlV1Rzh4cWFrbUstMzloSEh6a1dnbHRBUWpmVW42SF9Lazg0aGNlakZoeVoxdHlWMEhKVVFfY0xDNnBXNVVWcGFfUVRiQlp3MzFWSlNJcG5YM25lQkF5RUdOOG9kQThmaFV0Y21XQmJIa0tOZlJFMDdrUnJ3U2pT0gFWQVVfeXFMTnh1UGJXWHg0SXc1YnZzUnZmTmpQUThWZ1FGbXV1cjV3M25FYUd3NEhEc1dhbWRzZDdkX2VjbkUxa1VIZV9sNVpGR2xsbjFCU3dmNHJiNFE</guid></item><item><title>去年有123万人死于肺结核，世卫组织称--半岛电视台</title><link>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/13/tuberculosis-kills-1-23-million-people-last-year-who-says</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;header class="article-header"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Tuberculosis kills 1.23 million people last year, WHO says&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article__subhead"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UN health agency warns that recent progress in tackling the disease is under threat due to a shortfall in critical aid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;div class="article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20"&gt;&lt;div class="article-dates"&gt;&lt;p class="date-simple"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Published On 13 Nov 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;13 Nov 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rich-share" data-testid="rich-share"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-share__wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-share__button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;button class="rich-share__button row" aria-expanded="false"&gt;&lt;p class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Click here to share on social media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;svg class="icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 " viewbox="0 0 20 16" version="1.1" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;title&gt;share2&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path fill="#000" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;p class="rich-share__social-text"&gt;Share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis deaths have fallen by 3 percent to 1.23 million people in 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its annual TB report published on Wednesday, the United Nations health agency also revealed that overall cases of the disease had dropped by almost 2 percent since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;It marked the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic that TB cases and deaths had declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, a record 8.3 million people accessed TB treatment after being newly diagnosed while treatment success rates rose from 68 to 71 percent, the WHO said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the health agency warned that recent progress in tackling the disease was under threat due to a shortfall in aid. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it could “reverse the hard won gains”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, $5.9bn was available for prevention, diagnosis and treatment, far below the annual target of $22bn by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Declines in the global burden of TB and progress in testing, treatment, social protection and research are all welcome news after years of setbacks, but progress is not victory,” the WHO chief said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that TB continues to claim over a million lives each year despite being preventable and curable is simply unconscionable,” Tedros added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although TB deaths in 2024 were 29 percent lower than those recorded in 2015, the WHO had hoped to reduce this figure by 75 percent by 2025 and 90 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of deaths could even rise in the years ahead, warned Tereza Kasaeva, director of WHO’s division for tuberculosis, HIV and related infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long-term cuts to international donor funding could result in up to 2 million additional deaths and 10 million people falling ill with TB between 2025 and 2035,” Kasaeva said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency was dealt a significant financial blow when the United States withdrew from it in January, forcing a 21 percent cut to its proposed spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision by US President Donald Trump’s administration to slash foreign aid, particularly from the US Agency for International Development, has also raised fears about global TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, critical international aid helped to prevent 3.65 million deaths from the disease, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 08:37:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQSzl2NmVwVGc1bTVTd0VpV0hlaHJWeGVoV3BDNC1QdTIxMVFKRTBiNkN4eHFUYUtYTUxZTFFLdFR3MGUxZjFCYmluSmFmdVgzeG1HcENMN0FkRmFFMmFzSmtnUEI0UEx6SE1DOEVwbmktTDBCaDkzRUNLSktsX2l5cDBJWFUzY1prX0U1S0Zjcm94MWQ0VEhXTmpDeUhvejhv0gGmAUFVX3lxTE43a2ZlRUhUSmhkTFNQTFBXTGV4WVlXaUM1Q01pTExuY015ankwREMtS1VRMDNEVjhNTk03MDdaUk0yTUZTcTY1X0FwRVE1T3lCZjJ5WEVkRk00cHo3X2V0dVBWNnA4Ylk2QTNYRVFNaFJ6ZGhnMUt0VElsN2U5bi16Q3NPaUw1WFFjVnlaVHJHS0tLZFg4X2lvbUtLQ0owc3RxMHctenc</guid></item><item><title>我是一名明星运动员，但在我因一种几乎每个人都会接触到的常见病毒而瘫痪后，我的梦想破灭了-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15280981/paralyzed-contracting-common-virus-exposed.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Relly Ladner clutched her shin on the soccer field.

Play on, urged her watching coach, and Ladner did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that evening, a tingling sensation crept up from her ankles to her knees, then her legs went numb. It’s just dehydration, doctors at a busy &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-hampshire/index.html" id="mol-e4d6ee90-bfcc-11f0-9676-938fb839d8a8" class=""&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; emergency department assured her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the next morning, when Ladner woke up, she couldn’t move her legs at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was terrified,’ she told Daily Mail. ‘It was the worst feeling I have ever experienced.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed back to the hospital, where doctors tested the reflexes in her knee, only to find her leg didn't move. They then ordered a spinal tap, a test used to check for complications in the body's nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then came the &lt;span&gt;devastating diagnosis: Ladner had Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a rare disorder that affects one in 100,000 people, in which the immune system attacks the nerves, sometimes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14805541/Pins-needles-sign-fit-healthy-Luke-31-struck-surprisingly-common-condition-left-paralysed.html"&gt;leaving patients permanently paralyzed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and struggling to breathe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ladner, now 25, said: 'They were unsure if I was ever going to be able to walk again. They said I might never be able to stand and walk by myself again, or play soccer. [But] I was committed to playing soccer, I had planned my whole life around it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was May 2017, and Ladner was planning to attend Dartmouth College to play soccer after high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unwilling to accept the prognosis doctors gave her, Ladner worked tirelessly over eight months to regain her ability to move her legs, painstakingly relearning how to climb out of bed, walk, run and, finally, play soccer again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And ever since then, she has never taken her health for granted, becoming a marathon runner and now completing her second New York City marathon earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Relly Ladner, now 22 years old and living in New York City, started to suffer a tingling in her legs while playing with her soccer team, shown above, at age 17 years.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ladner said: 'I felt scared.

They wanted it to stop, because... it can spread all the way up [your body], you can become paralyzed everywhere, and people have to be on ventilators.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GBS is a rare autoimmune disorder where immune system cells misfire and target the peripheral nerves in the arms and legs, causing them to stop transmitting signals properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, patients feel a tingling or numbing sensation in the affected limbs before losing the ability to move altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear what causes the condition, but doctors say it may be triggered by the immune system misfiring after attacking a common viral infection that the patient may not even know they had, such as the flu, Covid or Epstein Barr Virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Proteins in the viruses are similar to those on nerve cells, scientists say, which can confuse the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The tingling turned to numbness and, by the next morning, she was no longer able to walk. Ladner was rushed to the hospital, shown, for treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a rare reaction, however, with only about 3,000 to 6,000 cases diagnosed in the US every year. The disease can strike at any age, but it is slightly more common among older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 80 percent of GBS patients are able to walk independently six months after their diagnosis, while 60 percent fully recover their muscle abilities within a year, according to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20363006"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians say many patients recover because of the intensive treatments offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About five to 10 percent&lt;span&gt; have very delayed or incomplete recovery, suffering from complications including paralysis, while less than two percent die as a result of the condition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Ladner's case, doctors infused the patient with &lt;/span&gt;immunoglobulin, proteins in the blood that fight infections, from a healthy donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although it is not a cure for GBS, physicians say it may help because the healthy plasma could contain substances that neutralize antibodies that are causing the body to attack its own nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight hours later, Ladner had a second infusion, and said that the numbness then stopped advancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with GBS, she suffered from aspetic meningitis, inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. This is not caused by GBS, but can be triggered as a result of blood plasma infusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite the odds and concerns she would never walk again, she overcame them and has now run in three marathons. She is pictured above while competing in the New York City marathon this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the treatments worked and her numbness started to ease, Ladner, her doctors and her family breathed a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while the paralysis wasn't advancing anymore, the virus had severely damaged the nerves in her legs, leaving her with almost no movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She remained in the hospital for several weeks, during which doctors worked to help her gradually regain the ability to climb out of bed and walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was then transferred to a rehabilitation facility, where she remained for several more months working with physical therapists, who helped her walk, run, climb and even kick a soccer ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was discharged in January 2018, eight months after her symptoms first emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, Ladner says her immune system remains 'weak', and that she frequently contracts viruses like the common cold or flu, but that her athletic ability is much improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as returning to the soccer field, she also found a passion for running after moving to New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joining New York Road Runners, a nonprofit that promotes running to boost health, she has now competed in three marathons and hopes to do more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She completed the Nashville marathon in April last year, and has now run the New York City marathon twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She still thinks back to her condition, however, fearing that it could return, but also using it to help motivate her to run more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said:&lt;span&gt; 'People always ask me, why am I motivated to run? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'And I really think that it's my like, having had Guillain-Barré, and having been told that I was never going to... be able to walk again, that motivates me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because, you know, there was a time when I was laying in a hospital bed unable to walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And so, even on the days when I'm like, not motivated, or when the training gets hard...  I think back to a time when I would have wished that I could have been doing what I am doing now. It helps me and pushes me to finish.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 05:16:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNWFFYVzNpYk9zTWFBVEhfNnMyQTJCSVlFYmZwb0F2R1ltQkxlblhxcmZ0OGJSZEYzRmZ1ZXhIYU5IdUtZX25GUjhHUVdzaEN0OVNDNFFoTWg1OFVyUzRvQmE5Z3ktbTI2VmlyUHA2ZzhadWtXUzkxQW1hck45eW04eFpCMU9EVkh4NTJ1RlA1UTVtMFAtUGxNUHE5RkpSZXJq0gGmAUFVX3lxTE8wZUJ4V2RCMzlsSG03NGhpWlp2TWhXZnhQdGd3SFVULVoza0hmOTg0RDBnVXNpS0p2el9SQ09WeEo0QVZhTzI0UjF6WGhId1p6eUxrck5obmgtNlFZbUU2aHNsbi10T3lDNDNtRTRCbUlTb0ZpVXZrWWc1QlRuMkJIYUhiQ2Z2QmI3LUw4cmFhRHEyNmVUY3RCbVIwdkRtVlFkaWstcUE</guid></item><item><title>告诉《华盛顿邮报》：您是否正在为更年期或围绝经期而苦苦挣扎？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/12/menopause-perimenopause-experiences/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PTNO4LJZ3JAYHNRZC6Z7KDA3YQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Washington Post wants to hear about your experiences navigating health care with perimenopause and menopause.

The findings, based on a meta analysis of data from 96 studies involving more than 400,000 children across 21 countries, &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(25)00281-0/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;were published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The review suggests obesity was a “substantial driver” of the sharp uptick in childhood hypertension, with nearly 19% of those living with obesity affected by the condition, compared with fewer than 3% in children and teenagers considered a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The nearly twofold increase in childhood high blood pressure over 20 years should raise alarm bells for healthcare providers and caregivers,” said study author Prof Igor Rudan, the director of the Centre for Global &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Research at Edinburgh University’s Usher Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study also suggests a further 8.2% of children and teenagers have prehypertension, meaning blood pressure levels are higher than normal but do not yet meet the criteria for hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prehypertension is especially prevalent during adolescence, with rates reaching 11.8% among teenagers, compared with about 7% in younger children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors said blood pressure levels rose sharply in early adolescence, peaking about the age of 14, especially among boys. This underlined the critical importance of regular screening during these critical years, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="79b1baab-ee9b-44d1-86a9-75e094011fb9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Junk food leads to more children being obese than underweight for first time","elementId":"79b1baab-ee9b-44d1-86a9-75e094011fb9","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/10/junk-food-upf-more-children-obese-than-underweight-unicef"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children and teenagers with prehypertension are more likely to progress to full hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Steve Turner, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, who was not involved with the review, said: “This sharp rise in high blood pressure among children is deeply concerning and largely driven by increasing childhood obesity – an entirely preventable condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“These findings mirror what paediatricians are seeing on the frontline. Children are presenting not only with hypertension, but also other serious conditions linked to obesity such as type 2 diabetes – once unheard of in children – asthma and mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We know that persistent hypertension is a risk factor for an early death due to damage to the cardiovascular system and other organs. Healthy children grow into healthy adults, but with trends like these, I fear that without urgent action we are hurtling towards a public health emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The rate of children and teenagers experiencing high blood pressure globally nearly doubled between 2000 and 2020, according to the meta analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2000, about 3.2% of children had hypertension, but by 2020, the prevalence had increased to more than 6.2% of children and teenagers under 19, affecting 114 million young people across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Study author Dr Peige Song, of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, said the uptick in cases was “driven largely by lifestyle factors such as unhealthy diets, decreased physical activity, and the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hypertension in children and adolescents has emerged as a substantial public health concern,” she said, adding that parents had a pivotal role in preventing and managing high blood pressure in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Promoting healthy habits, such as a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains while minimising salt and sugar intake, can substantially reduce the risk of hypertension. Encouraging regular physical activity and limiting sedentary behaviours, such as excessive screen time, are equally crucial,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For families with a history of hypertension, regular blood pressure monitoring for children is strongly recommended. Early detection of elevated blood pressure, particularly through home monitoring, can help mitigate the risk of long-term complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer of the British Heart Foundation, who was not involved with the review, said he was very concerned about the rise: “Elevated blood pressure in childhood often persists into adulthood, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The good news was that obesity-related high blood pressure could be reversed, he said. But bold action was also needed from governments to prevent so many children from having obesity in the first place. “This includes expanding restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy products and exploring further measures to drive the food industry to make our everyday foods healthier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPbFNWaHY2TlVWNFNWSGZxZ0ZWR3QxcFoyQUxaTHNLa3RRX3VqY3JZNDFKMTh1QmdhX2FNUC1HcjFxTkxxVjFmTmFWeWp2T2lmQndPbFJTZjFoLTBvS3gwTldUaXgzamUyNVdkc3JTNVdFOFVBNXNzTlp2bEV2V2tNV1gtNjUwWWNpUDN3eF9QQkxGWjhhamhvMlp3RnV5cy1yRFhuN3BHYXU</guid></item><item><title>裂孔性疝气是什么感觉？ 50岁以上的女性不应忽视的4个症状-女性世界</title><link>https://www.womansworld.com/wellness/hiatal-hernia-symptoms-and-treatments-for-women-over-50</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body class="post-template-default single single-post postid-591114 single-format-standard post-hiatal-hernia-symptoms-and-treatments-for-women-over-50 theme-womans-world has-custom-search article-format-posts" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

            Global rates of hypertension, or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/10/health/childhood-obesity-cognitive-decline-wellness"&gt;high blood pressure, in childhood&lt;/a&gt; and adolescence have nearly doubled since 2000, putting more kids at risk for poor health later in life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge7900083b6nsaiqi8jn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2000, about 3.4% of boys and 3% of girls had hypertension. By 2020, those numbers had risen to 6.5% and 5.8% respectively,” said Dr. Peige Song, a researcher from the School of Public Health at Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China. Song is one of the authors of a study describing the findings that published Wednesday in the journal The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge7900093b6n6ea4r93c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children who have hypertension could be at greater risk later on of developing heart disease –– &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm" target="_blank"&gt;the No. 1 cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, said Dr. Mingyu Zhang, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000a3b6nd46b1zll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The good news is that this is a modifiable risk,” Song said in an email. “With better screening, earlier detection, and a stronger focus on prevention, especially around healthy weight and nutrition, we can intervene before complications arise.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000b3b6n4hcld71t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rise in hypertension in children is likely due to many factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000c3b6nu1288h8z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Childhood obesity is a significant risk factor, because it is associated with factors like insulin resistance, inflammation and vascular function, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000d3b6n52urp9lc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dietary factors such as consuming high levels of sodium and ultraprocessed food can also contribute to hypertension risk, as well as poor sleep quality, stress and genetic predisposition, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000e3b6nz52l7v5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many children also get less movement than past generations and spend more time on sedentary activities, like screen use, which may be affecting risk, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000f3b6npefll77w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are also starting to know that other factors, including environmental pollutants, can contribute,” Zhang added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw7fvby00023b6n82iayngg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zhang served as senior author on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/pfas-blood-pressure-teens-wellness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a previous study&lt;/a&gt; that showed a connection between prebirth exposure to chemicals called PFAS — a class of about 15,000 human-made compounds linked to cancers, endocrine-related conditions and developmental issues in children — and childhood hypertension. Short for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS are sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they don’t fully break down in the environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000g3b6nnzu0m8du@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The biggest takeaway of this research for families is not to assume high blood pressure is only a problem for adults, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000h3b6ntmk3wskw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are worried about your child’s risk for obesity or hypertension, pressure, shame and restriction are not the best approaches.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000i3b6ng2y4iswg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, focus on increasing healthy behaviors in a happy way, said Jill Castle, a pediatric dietitian in Massachusetts, in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/health/kids-size-health-wellness"&gt;a previous CNN article&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000j3b6nrto53sp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The goal of the food pillar is really to embrace flexibility with food and to emphasize foods that are highly nutritious and … to allow foods also that might be minimally nutritious within the diet in ways that can be fully enjoyed and flexible,” Castle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000k3b6nlzirsnbi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Try to prioritize sitting down as a family for meals and avoid labeling foods as “good” or “bad,” said Castle, author of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kids-Thrive-Every-Size-Between/dp/152352183X" target="_blank"&gt;Kids Thrive at Every Size&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000l3b6nbgm4zqvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The clean plate club or rewarding with sweets — they might work in the moment, but they don’t do a good job of establishing the self-trust and an intuitive, good relationship with food as kids grow up,” Castle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000m3b6n5jerqgql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study didn’t just track rates in the United States. Instead, researchers analyzed data from 96 studies across 21 countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000n3b6nqooncpgr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another important consideration the study team made is how blood pressure differs in and outside the doctor’s office. Some children might have normal blood pressure at home, but a higher reading in the office, while others might have a lower blood pressure in the office than they normally would.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000o3b6ng9l747cf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By including data from both office visits and at-home blood pressure readings, the researchers were able to include hypertension rates that are “masked,” or wouldn’t be caught in a doctor’s visit, Zhang said. Masked hypertension was found to be the most common kind, according to the data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000p3b6n8hf6cjkc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is important because it means that many children with true hypertension could go undetected if we rely only on office blood pressure readings,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw5ge79000q3b6nmhrf70r3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The result show that one reading may not be enough, and there may be a need for more scalable solutions for better monitoring and care of hypertension around the world, Song added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

People who brought them in will then pick up the cat, and safely return them to the same location they picked them up to prevent repopulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some stipulations such as, if the temperatures are under 30 degrees overnight from Wednesday into Thursday morning, the shelter will cancel the trap and release day and wait till the next month. This is due to keeping the cats safe from being in the traps during below freezing temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shelter has vaccinated and sterilized a total of 162 cats so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit: &lt;a href="https://www.salina-ks.gov/animal-services"&gt;https://www.salina-ks.gov/animal-services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Salina Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:47:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9iWXVaRUY3bHpTS3dUdkVJVFVfdDE0Z2lpVnRxbnNWQm9oS1N6S1NwVHdMakJiUG1Yc2VZMkM1VklWZ0lNd2NwVHExZUU4X2dHalZCaEoxVFotRzI2bnp4eFdhSXVSS29HQVdFV1RlOUxSS1U</guid></item><item><title>创新的治疗方法，技术可以改变糖尿病护理- WJAR</title><link>https://turnto10.com/features/health-landing-page/beyond-blood-sugar-future-care-type-1-2-diabetes-epidemic-world-health-organization-glp-1-receptor-agonists-hormone-pancreas-insulin-pumps</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;NASHVILLE, Tenn. (Ivanhoe Newswire)  — &lt;/span&gt;The number of adults living with diabetes worldwide has surpassed 800 million, and the World Health Organization calls Type 2 diabetes an epidemic. But new science is giving hope. With more than 300 clinical trials underway, experts say prevention, early detection, and innovative treatments could dramatically change the outlook for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Lindsey Kovaleski, Type 1 diabetes has been part of her life since she was 12 -- just a little older than her girls, Lila and Evie, are now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I remember now being thirsty all the time. I remember running to the bathroom all the time," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindsey has navigated three decades of evolving treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I started off with multiple daily injections," she told Ivanhoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, diabetes research seems to be moving at lightning speed. There's a new class of medications called GLP-1 receptor agonists. They are drugs that mimic a natural hormone to regulate blood sugar and reduce appetite. The next generation, triple agonists, is already in trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm really optimistic that those two things will decrease the need for orthopedic intervention in diabetic patients and ultimately decrease the need for amputation," said Dr. Mark J. Berkowitz, an orthopedic surgeon and director of the Foot and Ankle Center at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEALTH CHECK: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology is transforming care as well. Continuous glucose sensors now link to insulin pumps that predict blood sugar spikes and drops before they happen, adjusting insulin automatically, day and night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are devices where patients can have their glucose readings immediately without poking their fingers," Dr. Barbara Gisella Carranza Leon, an endocrinologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also testing cell-based therapies that regenerate the insulin-producing beta cells destroyed by diabetes, with early trials showing some patients live months without insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Imagine having a medicine before that you had to give yourself twice a day, once a day, and now once a week. I'm looking forward to what is going to happen in the next 10 years," said Carranza Leon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies are engineering islet cells that evade the immune system, making pancreas transplants possible without immune-suppressing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's not just medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study at Harvard shows that a Mediterranean-style diet combined with moderate exercise and professional weight-loss support lowered the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 31% in older adults -- proof that lifestyle changes, along with these cutting-edge treatments, can help turn the tide of this global epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributors to this news report include Marsha Lewis, producer; Matt Goldschmidt, videographer; and Roque Correa, editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WJAR</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:34:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwJBVV95cUxQYlg5Q3ktUHBaS2xhWlBxTFEzYWFCRFllRzEyMVdrQWpQeU9kTU5Ec29ESFJiUzBtZFFYN2pqdVVnRDM1dmhjam5wRGE3dzE5QnpCYUJQY2lYeDhIX2MxNHB4U2VvRGE2cVBvWHIzMjc1N0ItUE1OWUl4VHZtekxmZF95VEpuRkZieHI0cnUtcnVoVGt0STQzeTV4ZEtqZ1A0RGYweU9pSEZhU3VVYzlzZVpFWWFTeUlSNEZaQ1daTzE0d2o3WW1XUkwtSWNVa1NFMWs2U1l5UmVUR05ZZktVejNhd096eFFqZGZkTW5xMHpDR2pYWWZwSUcxQm4wTmhmSDFQYVM0SVNMSHo4WlhOWFlUYWNnNkE</guid></item><item><title>马里科帕县确认在2个公共场所接触麻疹-马里科帕县（ .gov ）</title><link>https://www.maricopa.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3515</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content fr-view"&gt;	&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pasted="true"&gt;The Maricopa County Department of Public Health (MCDPH) has confirmed that a visitor from outside the county has been confirmed with measles and may have exposed people at two public locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are working closely with partners at the city and state levels, as well as at venues where the exposures occurred, to ensure that people are aware and protected,” said Dr. Nick Staab, chief medical officer at MCDPH. “This is a good reminder that any of us can face an exposure, and being vaccinated is our best defense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly infectious virus that can linger in the air for up to two hours, and approximately 90% of unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to measles will become infected. It is preventable with two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, typically given during childhood. Adults need at least one dose of MMR vaccine given after the age of one. Individuals born before 1957 or who had measles as a child are considered immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposures occurred at the following venues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Home2 Suites by Hilton Phoenix Downtown &lt;ul type="circle"&gt;&lt;li&gt;125 E Jackson St, Phoenix, AZ 85004&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;November 5th at 3:00 pm through November 6th at 1:00 pm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch for symptoms through November 27&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concert at Mortgage Matchup Center&lt;ul type="circle"&gt;&lt;li&gt;201 E Jefferson St, Phoenix, AZ 85004&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;November 5th, 6:00 pm through November 6 at 12:30 am&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch for symptoms through November 27&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who may have been exposed should watch for symptoms, which appear typically seven to 12 days after exposure but may take up to 21 days. Symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever (101 F or higher)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, and blotchy. The rash begins after other symptoms, usually on the face at the hairline, and moves down the body. The rash may last five to six days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals who develop symptoms are encouraged to seek medical care and testing.&lt;/strong&gt; They should call the provider ahead to let them know about symptoms and potential exposure before going in.

&lt;p&gt;The NOVA food classification system has been causing unnecessary confusion about which foods are “ultraprocessed.” It was developed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies in Health and Nutrition, School of Public Health at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and it groups foods by their level of processing and recommends avoiding “ultraprocessed foods” like candy and soda. All breakfast cereal is lumped in the ultraprocessed category. This has prompted debate among nutrition experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:%20courtney.pelitera@rd.topnutritioncoaching.com" target="_blank"&gt;Courtney Pelitera&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietician (RD), thinks the NOVA scale is being misinterpreted. “Processing simply refers to all physical, biological and chemical methods used during the food manufacturing process, including the use of additives. This classification system was never meant to determine the ‘healthiness of food’ as has become popular on social media channels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to RD &lt;a href="https://oldwayspt.org/inside-oldways/staff/kelly-leblanc/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7970648" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Kelly Toups LeBlanc&lt;/a&gt;, the VP of Nutrition Programming at Oldways, not all ultra-processed foods are created equal. “Some ultra-processed foods, like whole grain breakfast cereals, contain important food groups recommended in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Other ultra-processed foods, like candy bars and soft drinks, do not.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She takes issue with the way the NOVA list categorizes foods, especially whole-grain cereals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, refined grains like all-purpose flour, degermed cornmeal, and white rice, which have been processed to have their healthful bran and germ removed, are somehow considered minimally processed, putting them in the same category as fresh broccoli — while packaged 100% whole grain breads and whole grain breakfast cereals are considered ultra-processed,” LeBlanc said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that whole grain cereals can be an important part of nutrition assistance programs, providing valuable nutrition to vulnerable populations. “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623724346?via%3Dihub=" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7970648" data-affiliate="true"&gt;In a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from the USDA, government scientists designed a nutritious seven-day, 2,000-calorie diet in which 91% of calories came from ultra-processed foods,” LeBlanc said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does an RD look for in a breakfast cereal? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                Patients who are infected with malaria and dengue virus receive treatment in an isolation ward at a hospital in Pakistan. Drugs known as artemisinins have been remarkably effective in helping malaria patients recover but there's concern that the malaria parasite is developing resistance. A new drug called GanLum seems to offer a promising alternative.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;At the turn of the millennium, a new class of drugs derived from ancient Chinese herbal medicine revolutionized malaria care. Artemisinin's, as they're called, are based on extracts from the sweet wormwood plant. They arrived just as the drugs used since the 1970s were becoming useless for many, as the parasite that causes malaria evolved resistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The deaths we saw in the late 1990s, the early 2000s — like 2 million a year — that was a direct result of drug failure," says &lt;a href="https://www.mmv.org/about-us/our-team/george-jagoe" target="_blank"&gt;George Jagoe&lt;/a&gt;, executive vice president of access and product management at Medicines for Malaria Venture, a non-profit. "No one ever wants to be behind the 8-ball again."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Artemisinins have saved millions of lives since then and are now the foundation of malaria treatment worldwide. But there are &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/11/15/g-s1-34176/malaria-drug-resistance-children-artemisinin-africa" target="_blank"&gt;worrying signs&lt;/a&gt; that these drugs are following in the footsteps of their predecessors. To prevent history from repeating itself, new drugs that target the malaria parasite differently are required, says Jagoe.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I would call it being ready, having a fire extinguisher in the back that you're ready to use, but maybe not necessarily deploying, versus the house catches on fire and you've got nothing," says Jagoe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After more than two decades, researchers are on the cusp of having that fire extinguisher.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new drug, called GanLum, was more than 97% effective at treating malaria in clinical trials carried out across 12 African countries, researchers reported Wednesday at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Toronto. That's as good, if not better, than the current standard of treatment. If approved by regulators, it could be a powerful new tool against a disease that kills roughly half a million people each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a big deal," says &lt;a href="https://biology.nd.edu/people/kasturi-haldar/" target="_blank"&gt;Kasturi Haldar&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist at the University of Notre Dame who has studied malaria for decades and was not involved in this study. "It's also pretty timely."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That's because of artemisinin resistance. First discovered in southeast Asia in the late 2000s, it's recently spread to the continent hardest hit by malaria. "Partial artemisinin resistance has been spreading quite aggressively across many parts of Africa," says &lt;a href="https://microbiology.columbia.edu/faculty-david-fidock" target="_blank"&gt;David Fidock&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist at Columbia University who wasn't involved in the study. "We've been sounding the alarm that we must have new drugs to deploy, should resistance lead to treatment failure. [GanLum] will help stem that significantly."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;GanLum stands for ganaplacide/lumefantrine, a combination of two drugs, one new and one old (most antimalarial treatments are combinations of drugs, to target the parasite at different stages of infection). The new one, ganaplacide, was discovered by scientists at Novartis after screening over 2.3 million molecules&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for antimalarial properties. It seems to work by disrupting the malaria parasites' ability to live inside human red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the lab, the researchers showed it could kill all known forms of the parasite, including those with mutations linked to artemisinin resistance. It also attacks the stage of the parasite that's responsible for transmission. "That is very desirable for a drug to have," says Haldar, since it can prevent the spread, in addition to just treating the patient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In clinical trial settings, the drug performed well too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research team enrolled over 16,000 adults and children over 2 years old with malaria across a dozen countries in Africa. Half took GanLum over the course of three days and half got the current artemisinin-based standard of care. The team found both drugs were about equally effective, with GanLum coming out slightly on top. Both drugs had similar levels of side effects, including nausea and diarrhea. But the GanLum group did experience more vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drug still needs to clear additional regulatory hurdles before it gets to patients. The team thinks that'll take about a year and a half. Even if it's approved and rolled out, GanLum likely won't be fully replacing artemisinin-based treatments anytime soon, since arteminisin-based treatments still work in many areas. "But at this point, it looks good enough that it could be used where there's a lack of responsiveness to the current [artemisinin-based] drugs," says Haldar. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that could prolong the lifespan of both drugs, and help countries avoid the kind of surge in deaths that's happened when resistance overwhelms existing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BMJ&lt;/em&gt; has issued an expression of concern for a paper claiming stem cell therapy can reduce the risk of heart failure. The move comes after sleuths and scientists critiqued the “complete mismatch” between the study data and the article itself. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/11/06/sleuths-flag-complete-mismatch-in-data-of-bmj-stem-cell-study/"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt;, the October 29 paper included results of a phase III clinical trial in Shiraz, Iran. Critics quickly began pointing out discrepancies in the data on PubPeer, including psychologist Nick Brown, who pointed out a “curious repeating pattern of records in the dataset” every 101 records. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj-2024-083382"&gt;expression of concern&lt;/a&gt; published today, &lt;em&gt;The BMJ&lt;/em&gt; acknowledged issues “apparent from the data that support the paper” including data irregularities, discrepancies in the age criteria and the ages of participants included in the study, and undeclared conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-133319"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/24/improving-reproducibility-what-can-funders-do-guest-post-by-dorothy-bishop/"&gt;Dorothy Bishop&lt;/a&gt;, professor of developmental neuropsychology at Oxford University, was the first to point out issues with the paper, specifically that the study claimed to have enrolled only patients under 65 years of age. However, in the &lt;a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_b_PREVENT-TAHA8_study_Dataset_Prevention_of_Acute_Myocardial_Infarction-Induced_Heart_Failure_by_Intracoronary_Infusion_of_Mesenchymal_Stem_Cells_A_Phase_III_Randomized_Clinical_Trial_b_/29375153/2?file=55664687"&gt;accompanying data&lt;/a&gt;, 127 of the patients were older than 65 — a “complete mismatch,” she told us. She also noted the authors made the data available to the journal and reviewers only after the paper had undergone &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj-2024-083382/peer-review"&gt;two rounds of peer review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On PubPeer, Bishop pointed out potential conflicts of interest, noting author &lt;a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/mathuranthony.html"&gt;Anthony Mathur&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at Queen Mary University of London, is a &lt;a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10282577/officers"&gt;shareholder&lt;/a&gt; and trustee of the Heart Cells Foundation, a charity that funds &lt;a href="https://www.heartcellsfoundation.com/compassionate-centre/"&gt;a unit &lt;/a&gt;for administering stem cell therapies to cardiac patients.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The editors judge that the trial may have breached accepted practices and that the results may not be reliable,” the notice states. &lt;em&gt;The BMJ&lt;/em&gt; plans to investigate fully, the notice continues, and will consider an “auditable replacement dataset” the authors provided to the journal. Most of the authors, including corresponding author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/armin-attar-26ba11173/?originalSubdomain=ir"&gt;Armin Attar&lt;/a&gt;, are researchers at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After our article was published, sleuths &lt;a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C08779C45DB6E407DFAC85583BE9C4#1"&gt;continued to point out issues&lt;/a&gt; with the paper. &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/?s=Gideon+Meyerowitz-Katz"&gt;Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz&lt;/a&gt;, a research fellow at the University of Wollongong in Australia, noted “oddities” in the data, including that nearly half of recorded heart rates were divisible by five. He also pointed out an “unexpected” pattern in patient’s temperatures — of 311 recorded temperatures, 42 were exactly 36.2 degrees Celsius. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Retractions in &lt;em&gt;The BMJ &lt;/em&gt;are rare. The journal issued its first retraction in 1989 and has retracted a &lt;a href="https://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?%3d1%26jou%3dBMJ%253a%2bBritish%2bMedical%2bJournal"&gt;total of just 12 articles&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Retraction Watch Database.&lt;/p&gt;

Skowronski was senior &lt;a href="https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2025-0025"&gt;&lt;u&gt;author of the paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in the&lt;em&gt; Journal of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look to the US to see what is circulating, because it drives what's going on in North America," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H3N2 shows early dominance in UK, Japan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has not posted the standard weekly respiratory illness &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surveillance data since September 26&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it is unknown when or if national surveillance in the country will resume.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skowronski and her colleagues said sequencing information gleaned from the Northern Hemisphere 2024-25 influenza season showed influenza A mutations among emerging Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere H3N2 variants relative to the 2024-25 subclade J and updated 2025-26 subclade J.2 vaccine reference strains, which were used to formulate the current vaccine. H3N2 and H1N1 are both influenza A strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This subclade K emerged at the tail end of Southern Hemisphere's season after the WHO [World Health Organization] made the choice of the strain, which is subclass J2," she said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H1N1 predominated the flu season this year in the Southern Hemisphere, with the H3N2 subclade K taking off only at the end. But early data from the United Kingdom and Japan show that the H3N2 subclade K was represented in 90% of flu samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A drift, not a shift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's too early to tell what this will mean for the United States, but Skowronski said she and her colleagues do not believe this strain of H3N2 will lead to a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a major drift, not a shift," she said. "This is the same subtype we have had circulating in human population since 1968. But each season, the virus evolves to evade immunity, and some seasons it's relatively more successful than other seasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said she was encouraged, because the mutation sites would not affect how well antiviral drugs work, and the mutations are not associated with increased virulence or severity.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if vaccine efficacy is significantly reduced, more flu cases should be expected, and surveillance is crucial to determine how much protection flu vaccines are offering.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveillance needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Petrie, PhD, MPH, associate research scientist at Wisconsin's Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Population Health, said he's not seeing a lot of influenza activity — yet. The flu he and his colleagues have seen is primarily H1N1, but he expects H3N2 will be the dominant strain this year.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said most states will collect surveillance data throughout the season, but there's uncertainty given the lack of national surveillance provided by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influenza season can take off quickly, and it might sneak up on us you if we you aren't watching what is happening nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The influenza season can take off quickly, and it might sneak up on us you if we you aren't watching what is happening nationally," he said. "CDC also performs the more advanced characterization of circulating influenza viruses in terms of their genetics and how they interact with our existing immunity. These data are used to select viruses that will be represented in next year's vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now the experts have to wait. Skowronski said it could be that influenza B dominates instead of H3N2, though that's unlikely. In general, said Petrie, H3N2-dominant seasons pack a bigger punch, with lower effectiveness of the vaccine and more severe illness in older adults than in H1N1-dominant years.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrie said getting the flu vaccine is still important, even if there is a significant mismatch. "Even in seasons when vaccine effectiveness is lower, the vaccine still provides some protection and is the best thing you can do to reduce your risk of severe illness," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK preprint shows encouraging signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/691349457a0ccd6a3aad7fa9/_Flu_interimVE_2526_.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Today preprint data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the UK Health Security Agency on early influenza virus characterization and vaccine effectiveness (VE) suggest that the 2025-26 vaccine is currently 70% to 75% effective at preventing hospital attendance in children aged 2 to 17 years, and 30% to 40% effective in adults.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The observed early VE is similar to end of season VE estimates typically seen in adults in recent years in the UK, Europe, and Canada," the authors wrote. "Our results are encouraging, though it is important to note that these observations are from a period very soon after vaccination when there has been no waning in effectiveness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strong protection, especially among children, is encouraging after the UK authors described reduced reactivity of subclade K with post-infection ferret antisera, and described an early and sharp rise in UK flu cases.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nevertheless, vaccine effectiveness against hospital attendance and admission in the early season currently remains within a typical range at 70 to 75% in children and 30 to 40% in adults," the authors added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This trend appears to be driven primarily by a rise in spanking, though the research also points to a smaller but significant increase in hitting and choking. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2025.2565660" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Journal of Sex Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific literature has explored the connection between viewing pornography with aggressive content and holding attitudes that support aggression. A body of research indicates that exposure to aggressive pornography is associated with a greater likelihood of sexually aggressive behaviors and attitudes. Despite these connections, there has been considerable debate and variation in findings regarding how much aggression is actually present in mainstream pornography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous analyses of pornographic content have produced varied results about how common aggression is, partly due to different definitions, time periods, and types of media being studied. Most of this research did not include data from the last decade, a period of significant change in online content. The researchers of the current study sought to provide a systematic, long-term analysis to understand if, and how, depictions of aggression within highly popular online pornographic videos have changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was teaching a class on deviance and came across claims about rates of aggression in sexuality that were either not empirically substantiated or relied on problematic analyses and definitions of aggression. So I decided to conduct my own research on it, particularly on the common claim that mainstream pornography is becoming ‘harder and harder,”‘” said study author Eran Shor, a professor at McGill University and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.routledge.com/Aggression-in-Pornography-Myths-and-Realities/Shor-Seida/p/book/9780367540302" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Aggression in Pornography: Myths and Realities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “This research is part of the larger picture that I present in my book.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these trends, the researchers analyzed a sample of 255 videos from Pornhub, one of the most visited websites globally. They selected videos from the “most viewed” category, sampling content uploaded between the years 2000 and 2024 to create a long-term perspective. Each video had received at least two million views. This strategy was chosen to focus on the content most likely to be seen by large audiences and to maintain a consistent type of video for comparison across the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used two different operational measurements for aggression. The first, termed “visible aggression,” included a predefined list of physical acts like spanking, hitting, and choking, regardless of whether performers appeared to consent. The second definition, “nonconsensual aggression,” was applied only when performers showed clear verbal or nonverbal signs of resistance or distress that were ignored by their partners. Coders also noted the presence of specific aggressive acts, titles suggesting aggression, and verbal aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the entire 25-year sample, visible physical aggression was present in 43.9% of the videos. Spanking was by far the most frequent act, appearing in 39.2% of all videos, followed by hair pulling at 10.2%. In contrast, nonconsensual aggression was found to be quite uncommon, appearing in only 1.6% of the videos analyzed. Titles that suggested aggression were also relatively uncommon, appearing in about 10% of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s analysis of trends over time provides evidence of a notable shift in content. The rate of visible aggression nearly tripled, rising from approximately 20% in the videos sampled from the early 2000s to around 55-60% in videos from the last decade. This suggests that viewers of popular pornography today are substantially more likely to encounter scenes with physical aggression than they were 15 to 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous research that covered data up to the mid-2010s did not find a significant increase in most types of aggression,” Shor told PsyPost. “So the significant increase in this study that covered data up to the mid 2020s was not necessarily expected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers report that this increase can largely be attributed to a sharp rise in the depiction of spanking. This practice was seen in less than 20% of videos from the 2000s but appeared in more than half of the videos sampled from the late 2010s and early 2020s. The authors note that spanking is often considered a milder form of aggression and that its meaning can be subjective, with some viewers not perceiving it as aggressive at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While spanking accounted for most of the change, the study also identified a statistically significant increase in other forms of aggression that are often considered more severe. Depictions of hitting a partner’s body or face showed an increase, as did the practice of choking or applying pressure to the neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise in depictions of choking was particularly consistent. This practice was absent in the earliest videos sampled for the study but showed a steady climb over the years, appearing in 15% of the most popular videos from the 2020s. This finding aligns with anecdotal reports and scholarly concerns about the normalization of choking in sexual contexts. The study did not find significant changes over time for nonconsensual aggression, titles suggesting aggression, or verbal aggression, which all remained relatively low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there’s a rise in overall aggression over the years, most of it can be ascribed to an increase in relatively light forms of aggression, primarily spanking,” Shor said. “Still, I also found a significant (though smaller) increase in hitting and strangulation. The latter is particulalry concerning, as it might affect young people’s sexual script and normalize a practice that could be health-risking and even life- endangering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose that a bidirectional relationship may exist, where pornography both reflects and shapes sexual interests. As choking becomes more visible in pornography, it may be perceived as a normal or expected part of a sexual script. This can influence viewers to believe the practice is safe and does not require explicit consent, potentially leading them to incorporate it into their own sexual activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge certain limitations to their study. The sample size was relatively modest, and the analysis was confined to the “most viewed” videos on a single website, which may not represent all available pornographic content. Relying on the platform’s own viewership data also presents a potential constraint, as such figures could be manipulated for commercial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For future research, the study suggests expanding analyses to include larger samples, other websites, and different genres of pornography. Researchers could also explore subscription-based services or employ more context-sensitive coding methods to better understand how viewers might interpret these acts. Such an approach could provide a more nuanced understanding of how sexual scripts in pornography are changing and how they are perceived by audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2025.2565660" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Rise of Spanking, Hitting, and Strangulation: A Longitudinal Evaluation of Aggression in Pornography&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Eran Shor and Xuanchi Liu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 21:07:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNVFg4aEpDNXJRdDhzWXpnWl9fdjlpVjNiVllKaXNJVTc5d2xEbVhTaE5vMzloRmxORW41Ym9uWVhPcnc1WEdhaDNtdUVDMUZpNElZU01ONVRqVm1teTBLTlpxS1lJRDJMeVcwSTZZdVJoMDZCRlVqQ2VuUm9PaTBDbU8wN0tVdXRNR2VOMnFhNlpUQQ</guid></item><item><title>美国的警告上升，因为严重的流感病毒H3N2导致加拿大，英国爆发- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/evere-flu-strain-h3n2-us-response-outbreaks-canada-uk-rcna243431</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f9a3a" class="body-graf"&gt;As flu season gets underway, global health experts are increasingly worried about a new strain of the virus that popped up in June — four months after the makeup of this year’s flu shots had been decided. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3926ec" class="body-graf"&gt;The new strain, a version of H3N2, is causing outbreaks in Canada and the U.K., where health officials are &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj.r2391" target="_blank"&gt;warning about the early wave&lt;/a&gt; that’s sending people to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63cd7a" class="body-graf"&gt;“Since it emerged, it’s rapidly spreading and predominating in some countries so far in the Northern Hemisphere,” Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization’s Global Respiratory Threats Unit, said Wednesday during a media briefing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b34bb8" class="body-graf"&gt;The version of H3N2 that’s circulated worldwide this year “acquired 7 new mutations over the summer,” Antonia Ho, a consultant in infectious diseases at Scotland’s University of Glasgow, said in a media statement.

Last year, the vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_w" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:up to 55% effective;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;up to 55% effective&lt;/a&gt; in keeping adults with the flu out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/691349457a0ccd6a3aad7fa9/_Flu_interimVE_2526_.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health authorities in the U.K. published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;health authorities in the U.K. published&lt;/a&gt; preliminary evidence that this year’s vaccine is up to 40% effective in preventing hospitalization among adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Schaffner encouraged people to get the shot anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“All of the data over previous decades shows that even if there is not a close match, use of the vaccine continues to prevent hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and continues to help keep people out of the cemetery,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/evere-flu-strain-h3n2-us-response-outbreaks-canada-uk-rcna243431" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBCNews.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NBCNews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 20:52:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOWE1DUm9SZmw3M19EazZfUnJ0cEszdEFlREpEVk9mTWQ1Q0JhcmtuWXpUQXh2VzBtZXREWU90d1VhWHhVQk8tdDZkQUR4Si1SOHJzTjE3UkdKV2d5cTBIb05yXzN6dGJYck1Id3lmZmtZSVhqZ09LTk01ajNMV0VUTGdhcw</guid></item><item><title>美国卫生领导人称赞激素治疗更年期的好处。医生正在推动平衡- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/fda-hormone-therapy-menopause-balance</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8hvq000x2cnja9mm34me@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Monday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced that after 20 years, they were righting a medical wrong — what Makary has called “maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine” — by pushing to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/hormone-therapy-menopause-fda-warning-wellness"&gt;remove the “black box” warning&lt;/a&gt; on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00022e6fzxt827bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By dismissing the classwide boxed warning that flagged risks of heart disease, breast cancer and potentially dementia from estrogen-containing products, the FDA expects to open access to a therapy that Makary said was so impactful, it ranks near &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrMakaryFDA/status/1987891721922138128" target="_blank"&gt;antibiotics and vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwax2o6001v3b6qijj2zmmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary blamed the broad&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;22-year-old warning on flawed, misrepresented research he said became dogma and “medical groupthink” that spread fear and dismissal of women’s menopausal “mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, hot flashes, divorce.” He hailed the “profound long-term health benefits that few people, even physicians, know about.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb4bqp00243b6qedceb4w6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HRT has saved marriages, rescued women from depression, prevented children from going without a mother,” Makary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb38i900213b6qqlif026a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, addressing an audience that included his wife and two daughters, described how prescription pills, creams, sprays, patches and injections that deliver estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone could dramatically cut a woman’s risk of heart disease and dementia and even extend life an additional decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb5qa100263b6q2yyy3btd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Physicians who treat women applauded parts of the decision but said they worry that the benefits of hormones might be oversold based on outdated or cherry-picked data. Some said the removal of the black box warning from all forms of hormone therapy — particularly pills, which deliver estrogen to the entire body — isn’t scientifically justified and downplays evidence of real risks of longer-term use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb7jqz002g3b6q0pirwzho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They’re not miracle drugs, they say, and benefits and risks will vary from woman to woman.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwaw547001s3b6qr5vomf7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really worry about this overwhelming embrace of hormone replacement therapy without understanding the data,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, an interventional cardiologist and director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center. Cho was the lead author of a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank"&gt;comprehensive research review&lt;/a&gt; published in 2023 that detailed the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for women of various ages and health histories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb6a1r002a3b6qp0axhpao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cho and other experts say that what’s needed now is better balance. They are asking FDA officials and doctors to treat hormone therapy like any other drug that has both benefits and risks, and remember that hormones aren’t the only options for treating menopausal symptoms anymore.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00052e6fp0iuc4vq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After extolling the benefits of hormones, Makary emphasized that doctors and patients would decide what treatments to use and for how long. The government, he said, is not the doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwao5sc00153b6q3e5a5luf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We want people to talk to their doctors,” he said, “and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000f2e6fjno14x4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2002, a large government-funded randomized controlled trial called the Women’s Health Initiative was stopped early by an outside panel of experts who were monitoring the results in real time. The panel, called the data safety monitoring board, had determined that the risks of taking a combination of estrogen and progesterone outweighed the benefits to study participants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000i2e6fhdoflnc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After analyzing the results of the study in detail, the FDA determined in 2003 that women should be informed of the risks of estrogen-containing therapies and ordered&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that those risks be prominently featured on the product labels as a boxed warning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000g2e6f1xhkau1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women stopped using hormones in droves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000h2e6fnr8b7qsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Basically, we went from everybody wanting to put estrogen in the water to prevent heart disease, to then this black box label where you wouldn’t dare use it,” said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Researcher Center, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000j2e6f8xlrpmy3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And now we’re going back to ‘Let’s remove the black box label,’ so it feels like we really have come full circle.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000l2e6fx6y9gltc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Newer evidence suggests that hormones applied to the skin aren’t metabolized by the body the same way as bodywide estrogen therapies and thus may have lower risks. Women’s health advocates have argued for years that these blanket warnings have unfairly lumped estrogen applied to the skin and the lining of the vaginal canal with estrogen pills and injections that raise estrogen levels in the blood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000m2e6fthozsvys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary said this week that the FDA’s decision to ditch &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841321" target="_blank"&gt;most of the black box warning&lt;/a&gt; — it will still caution women who have a uterus not take estrogen alone, since that increases the risk of endometrial cancer — was based on an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025" target="_blank"&gt;expert panel&lt;/a&gt; discussion held earlier this year and the agency’s own “robust review of the latest scientific evidence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000n2e6f6tr64aj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary said that the FDA’s staff scientists enthusiastically recommended the move and that their evidence review would be published at a later date.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000o2e6frnwc5dd2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, a person with direct knowledge of the FDA’s plans said Makary was referring to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841321" target="_blank"&gt;a Viewpoint article&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by Makary and three other FDA officials in the medical journal JAMA. (In the conflicts of interest section, the article notes that Makary receives royalties from sales of his 2024 book, “Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health,” which devotes a chapter to hormone therapy.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000p2e6fyaqmxqa9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The JAMA article was essentially that. The FDA conducted their comprehensive review,” said the person, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to share the information with the media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000q2e6fmkm8hagb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the JAMA Viewpoint is not the detailed study of studies that researchers and regulators typically undertake when trying to assess the benefits and risks of a treatment. Instead, it is a position statement that cited selected studies to support its points.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000r2e6f1f9waqvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During Monday’s announcement, for example, Makary held up a study he said was “from the journal Cancer” in 2023 that “concluded that more than 40 observational studies show a consistent 30% to 50% reduction in coronary heart disease.” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9178928/" target="_blank"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; Makary referenced was not from Cancer, a highly cited medical journal published by the American Cancer Society, but from a lesser-known publication called The Cancer Journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000s2e6fcvclu6f4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary also didn’t mention&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the sentence in that paper that said randomized controlled trials “have shown a null effect of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;[hormone replacement therapy] on [coronary heart disease] in analyses of women over all ages, typically 45–90 years old when randomized to HRT versus placebo” — meaning studies that have compared women taking estrogen-containing hormone therapies with those on a placebo have found no net benefit for heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000t2e6fym2eib53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other studies cited in an HHS fact sheet on the decision – including one to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of heart disease by 50% – come from research reviews that are decades old and don’t include more recent scientific findings. A citation to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of dementia by 65% comes from an older, relatively small Danish study of 343 women published in 2005.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000u2e6f0bcq9lvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The type of evidence, as well as the breadth of evidence the FDA uses to make its regulatory decisions, matters, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000v2e6f7917bay7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Rebecca Thurston, the assistant dean of women’s health research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, noted that the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning “was a deviation from the typical process.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000w2e6f5ejegtbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past, the agency has followed &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-requires-removal-some-prescribing-and-dispensing-restrictions" target="_blank"&gt;a very different protocol&lt;/a&gt; when considering the removal of black box warnings from drugs like the diabetes treatment&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Avandia, which had a warning removed in 2013. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-revises-description-mental-health-side-effects-stop-smoking" target="_blank"&gt;followed similar steps&lt;/a&gt;, including the review of new data and convening of an advisory committee, when it removed the boxed warning from the smoking cessation drug Chantix in 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000y2e6fiegh68sb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Asked Monday why the FDA had not convened an advisory committee to review all the data on hormone therapy and make recommendations to the agency, Makary said it was because such committees are “are bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive, so we can have an active, robust discussion as a group of medical experts spontaneously.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000z2e6fhkt1g061@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In July, at the FDA’s panel on hormone therapy, many of the experts were there to champion the removal of the warning from a specific group of hormone products: vaginal estrogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwai2as00113b6ql198ibz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medical groups including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Menopause Society had advocated to remove the warning from those products for nearly a decade. The FDA had rejected a petition to remove the boxed warning from the vaginal estrogen products in 2018, citing a lack of evidence on their safety.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00132e6fwjgaevk3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaginal estrogens prevent thinning and drying of the tissues that line the vaginal walls, which can lead to painful sex and urinary tract infections. Estrogens inserted into the vagina stay in the tissues there and don’t seem to affect blood levels, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00142e6fawrsrdhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The boxed warning for local vaginal estrogen was inappropriate. It was not evidence-based, and it was leading to many women not benefiting from a safe and effective medication for a common debilitating condition,” Manson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwcklm900003b6qjvc4kz51@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Four major medical societies that have established guidelines on the use of hormone therapy to relieve menopause symptoms — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society — told CNN that the FDA did not reach out to them before making the new decision to lift the boxed warning on estrogen-containing products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00162e6fyeytklhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, some experts said they felt that the FDA was going too far in removing the warning from systemic therapies — such as pills or injections that don’t just stay in one area but travel around the body — especially in the absence of any new clinical trial evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00172e6ff5ucoacl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HHS and the FDA have claimed that the removal of the boxed warning for hormone replacement therapy will ‘restore gold-standard science to women’s health.’ In fact, the opposite is true. These treatments have well-documented cardiovascular, cognitive and cancer safety risks,” Nina Zeldes, a health researcher at Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, said in a statement Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00182e6fjts7bpiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zeldes pointed out that claims that hormones could lengthen life and prevent dementia and heart disease go beyond what these products are approved for: treating menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone loss in osteoporosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00192e6fj7td5js1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unsubstantiated claims by senior FDA officials about the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for unapproved indications undermines public trust in the agency’s decision-making,” Zeldes said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001a2e6fdjbmwjyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the group was supportive of the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning since it would surely encourage more conversations between women and their doctors about using hormone therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001b2e6fhd00gztx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fleishman cautioned, though, that not all hormone therapy products carry the same risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001c2e6fnyvqu9oz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is important to distinguish that systemic estrogen products — such as oral estrogen and transdermal patches, gels, and sprays — have a different safety profile than low-dose vaginal estrogen. Like all medications, systemic estrogen products are not without risk, and their use should be based on an individualized conversation between patients and their clinicians,” he said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001e2e6fpe1tsdw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All things considered, experts say, there’s still not enough evidence that taking hormones long-term can prevent chronic diseases of aging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001f2e6fam6pwjqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most women who are post-menopausal can probably take hormone replacement therapy,” said the Cleveland Clinic’s Cho. “However, what we now know from many, many years of hormone replacement trials is that there are women in whom we should really have sort of careful discussion, risk-benefit analysis before starting hormone replacement therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001g2e6fp3veyrbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If women have high blood pressure, they have high cholesterol, they are overweight, we should really pause before we start hormone replacement therapy and discuss the pros and cons.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001h2e6fz01skpsx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is good evidence that some types of hormone therapy reduce the risk for hip fracture, which many older adults struggle to recover from. The FDA approved hormone therapy for osteoporosis in 1988. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9632404/#:~:text=A%20population%2Dbased%20case%2Dcontrol%20study%20in%20Sweden%20found,gave%20similar%20risk%20estimates%20as%20oral%20regimens" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; estimated that each year of hormone therapy decreased the risk of hip fracture by about 6% per year of use, and data from the Framingham heart study found that the risk of hip fracture was reduced by 65% in current users of hormone therapy and about 30% in former users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001i2e6f1a1k8xab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But hormone therapy isn’t the only drug that treats bone health, so experts say women should weigh all their options with their doctors before making their decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001j2e6fqcpuwdv7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some worry that the FDA overshot the mark by removing the warning from all types of hormone therapies, especially pills, which expose the entire body to hormones and may increase a person’s risk for dangerous blood clots as much as fivefold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001k2e6fjejxsm2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would prefer a more nuanced change of the labeling if it was for systemic therapies,” said Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001l2e6f10026pxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that there are estrogen preparations, particularly oral ones, that the black box warning is still relevant for, and I think for the combinations of hormone therapy that were used in the [Women’s Health Initiative], I think those warnings are relevant. That’s where these data came from.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001m2e6fz52e5com@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Transdermal, or through-the-skin, estrogen creams, gels, patches and sprays don’t seem to be metabolized by the liver the same way pills are. As a result, there’s some evidence that transdermal forms of estrogen may not raise blood clot risk the same way pills do, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001n2e6fbovpi2gz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think if it was just the vaginal preparations, a lot of us have been saying for a long time that this would make sense,” Stuenkel said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001o2e6fs0p34u17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts are worried that doctors and patients will misread the FDA’s action as a green light to use hormones in all women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001p2e6f842zwmf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Already, says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, a physician at the Mayo Clinic who is medical director of the Menopause Society, says she’s had patients well past the age of menopause come in and ask to take estrogen. One wanted to know whether she should take it for tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, and to improve markers of heart health like homocysteine and cholesterol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001q2e6f3ejr6eoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a weird place to be in,” Faubion said. “With every patient, and I’m like, ‘All right, which side are we on?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001r2e6f6fn8w2qw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Invariably, Faubion finds herself having one of two very different kinds of conversations with patients about hormone therapy: Either “it’s not an anti-aging drug. You shouldn’t take it for everything” or “it’s not going to kill you, really. I promise it’s a safe therapy, and you can use it for your hot flashes,” she said. “But it’s one or the other.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001s2e6f1j0fdssa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2840561?widget=personalizedcontent&amp;amp;previousarticle=201958" target="_blank"&gt;recent viewpoint&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, Thurston, at the University of Pittsburgh, said she hopes this time that women and their doctors won’t treat hormone therapy like a miracle drug, but with the same consideration they’d give any other medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001t2e6fs0s9pwb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It has risks, it has benefits, it has indications, it has contraindications, but it is neither a panacea nor poison,” Thurston said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001u2e6fhhmlnqvz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every woman is different, and every woman’s needs during perimenopause and menopause will be unique. In recent years, the FDA has even approved two nonhormonal drugs that can help women manage their hot flashes, Veozah and Lynkuet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwbdg0v002u3b6qpt9r6gob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said patients and their doctors should carefully consider their choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001v2e6fkkoacw7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And really, women deserve a range of different options,” Thurston said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            On Monday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced that after 20 years, they were righting a medical wrong — what Makary has called “maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine” — by pushing to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/hormone-therapy-menopause-fda-warning-wellness"&gt;remove the “black box” warning&lt;/a&gt; on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00022e6fzxt827bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By dismissing the classwide boxed warning that flagged risks of heart disease, breast cancer and potentially dementia from estrogen-containing products, the FDA expects to open access to a therapy that Makary said was so impactful, it ranks near &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrMakaryFDA/status/1987891721922138128" target="_blank"&gt;antibiotics and vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwax2o6001v3b6qijj2zmmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary blamed the broad&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;22-year-old warning on flawed, misrepresented research he said became dogma and “medical groupthink” that spread fear and dismissal of women’s menopausal “mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, hot flashes, divorce.” He hailed the “profound long-term health benefits that few people, even physicians, know about.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb4bqp00243b6qedceb4w6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HRT has saved marriages, rescued women from depression, prevented children from going without a mother,” Makary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb38i900213b6qqlif026a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, addressing an audience that included his wife and two daughters, described how prescription pills, creams, sprays, patches and injections that deliver estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone could dramatically cut a woman’s risk of heart disease and dementia and even extend life an additional decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb5qa100263b6q2yyy3btd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Physicians who treat women applauded parts of the decision but said they worry that the benefits of hormones might be oversold based on outdated or cherry-picked data. Some said the removal of the black box warning from all forms of hormone therapy — particularly pills, which deliver estrogen to the entire body — isn’t scientifically justified and downplays evidence of real risks of longer-term use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb7jqz002g3b6q0pirwzho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They’re not miracle drugs, they say, and benefits and risks will vary from woman to woman.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwaw547001s3b6qr5vomf7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really worry about this overwhelming embrace of hormone replacement therapy without understanding the data,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, an interventional cardiologist and director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center. Cho was the lead author of a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank"&gt;comprehensive research review&lt;/a&gt; published in 2023 that detailed the risks and benefits of hormone therapy for women of various ages and health histories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwb6a1r002a3b6qp0axhpao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cho and other experts say that what’s needed now is better balance. They are asking FDA officials and doctors to treat hormone therapy like any other drug that has both benefits and risks, and remember that hormones aren’t the only options for treating menopausal symptoms anymore.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00052e6fp0iuc4vq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After extolling the benefits of hormones, Makary emphasized that doctors and patients would decide what treatments to use and for how long. The government, he said, is not the doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwao5sc00153b6q3e5a5luf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We want people to talk to their doctors,” he said, “and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000f2e6fjno14x4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2002, a large government-funded randomized controlled trial called the Women’s Health Initiative was stopped early by an outside panel of experts who were monitoring the results in real time. The panel, called the data safety monitoring board, had determined that the risks of taking a combination of estrogen and progesterone outweighed the benefits to study participants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000i2e6fhdoflnc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After analyzing the results of the study in detail, the FDA determined in 2003 that women should be informed of the risks of estrogen-containing therapies and ordered&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that those risks be prominently featured on the product labels as a boxed warning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000g2e6f1xhkau1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women stopped using hormones in droves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000h2e6fnr8b7qsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Basically, we went from everybody wanting to put estrogen in the water to prevent heart disease, to then this black box label where you wouldn’t dare use it,” said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Researcher Center, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000j2e6f8xlrpmy3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And now we’re going back to ‘Let’s remove the black box label,’ so it feels like we really have come full circle.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000l2e6fx6y9gltc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Newer evidence suggests that hormones applied to the skin aren’t metabolized by the body the same way as bodywide estrogen therapies and thus may have lower risks. Women’s health advocates have argued for years that these blanket warnings have unfairly lumped estrogen applied to the skin and the lining of the vaginal canal with estrogen pills and injections that raise estrogen levels in the blood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000m2e6fthozsvys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary said this week that the FDA’s decision to ditch &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841321" target="_blank"&gt;most of the black box warning&lt;/a&gt; — it will still caution women who have a uterus not take estrogen alone, since that increases the risk of endometrial cancer — was based on an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025" target="_blank"&gt;expert panel&lt;/a&gt; discussion held earlier this year and the agency’s own “robust review of the latest scientific evidence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000n2e6f6tr64aj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary said that the FDA’s staff scientists enthusiastically recommended the move and that their evidence review would be published at a later date.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000o2e6frnwc5dd2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, a person with direct knowledge of the FDA’s plans said Makary was referring to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2841321" target="_blank"&gt;a Viewpoint article&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by Makary and three other FDA officials in the medical journal JAMA. (In the conflicts of interest section, the article notes that Makary receives royalties from sales of his 2024 book, “Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health,” which devotes a chapter to hormone therapy.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000p2e6fyaqmxqa9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The JAMA article was essentially that. The FDA conducted their comprehensive review,” said the person, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to share the information with the media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000q2e6fmkm8hagb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the JAMA Viewpoint is not the detailed study of studies that researchers and regulators typically undertake when trying to assess the benefits and risks of a treatment. Instead, it is a position statement that cited selected studies to support its points.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000r2e6f1f9waqvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During Monday’s announcement, for example, Makary held up a study he said was “from the journal Cancer” in 2023 that “concluded that more than 40 observational studies show a consistent 30% to 50% reduction in coronary heart disease.” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9178928/" target="_blank"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; Makary referenced was not from Cancer, a highly cited medical journal published by the American Cancer Society, but from a lesser-known publication called The Cancer Journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000s2e6fcvclu6f4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary also didn’t mention&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the sentence in that paper that said randomized controlled trials “have shown a null effect of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;[hormone replacement therapy] on [coronary heart disease] in analyses of women over all ages, typically 45–90 years old when randomized to HRT versus placebo” — meaning studies that have compared women taking estrogen-containing hormone therapies with those on a placebo have found no net benefit for heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000t2e6fym2eib53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other studies cited in an HHS fact sheet on the decision – including one to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of heart disease by 50% – come from research reviews that are decades old and don’t include more recent scientific findings. A citation to support the claim that hormone therapy can cut a woman’s risk of dementia by 65% comes from an older, relatively small Danish study of 343 women published in 2005.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000u2e6f0bcq9lvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The type of evidence, as well as the breadth of evidence the FDA uses to make its regulatory decisions, matters, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000v2e6f7917bay7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Rebecca Thurston, the assistant dean of women’s health research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, noted that the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning “was a deviation from the typical process.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000w2e6f5ejegtbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past, the agency has followed &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-requires-removal-some-prescribing-and-dispensing-restrictions" target="_blank"&gt;a very different protocol&lt;/a&gt; when considering the removal of black box warnings from drugs like the diabetes treatment&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Avandia, which had a warning removed in 2013. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-revises-description-mental-health-side-effects-stop-smoking" target="_blank"&gt;followed similar steps&lt;/a&gt;, including the review of new data and convening of an advisory committee, when it removed the boxed warning from the smoking cessation drug Chantix in 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000y2e6fiegh68sb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Asked Monday why the FDA had not convened an advisory committee to review all the data on hormone therapy and make recommendations to the agency, Makary said it was because such committees are “are bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive, so we can have an active, robust discussion as a group of medical experts spontaneously.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw000z2e6fhkt1g061@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In July, at the FDA’s panel on hormone therapy, many of the experts were there to champion the removal of the warning from a specific group of hormone products: vaginal estrogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwai2as00113b6ql198ibz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medical groups including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Menopause Society had advocated to remove the warning from those products for nearly a decade. The FDA had rejected a petition to remove the boxed warning from the vaginal estrogen products in 2018, citing a lack of evidence on their safety.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00132e6fwjgaevk3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaginal estrogens prevent thinning and drying of the tissues that line the vaginal walls, which can lead to painful sex and urinary tract infections. Estrogens inserted into the vagina stay in the tissues there and don’t seem to affect blood levels, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00142e6fawrsrdhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The boxed warning for local vaginal estrogen was inappropriate. It was not evidence-based, and it was leading to many women not benefiting from a safe and effective medication for a common debilitating condition,” Manson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwcklm900003b6qjvc4kz51@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Four major medical societies that have established guidelines on the use of hormone therapy to relieve menopause symptoms — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and the Endocrine Society — told CNN that the FDA did not reach out to them before making the new decision to lift the boxed warning on estrogen-containing products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00162e6fyeytklhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, some experts said they felt that the FDA was going too far in removing the warning from systemic therapies — such as pills or injections that don’t just stay in one area but travel around the body — especially in the absence of any new clinical trial evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00172e6ff5ucoacl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HHS and the FDA have claimed that the removal of the boxed warning for hormone replacement therapy will ‘restore gold-standard science to women’s health.’ In fact, the opposite is true. These treatments have well-documented cardiovascular, cognitive and cancer safety risks,” Nina Zeldes, a health researcher at Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, said in a statement Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00182e6fjts7bpiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zeldes pointed out that claims that hormones could lengthen life and prevent dementia and heart disease go beyond what these products are approved for: treating menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone loss in osteoporosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw00192e6fj7td5js1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unsubstantiated claims by senior FDA officials about the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for unapproved indications undermines public trust in the agency’s decision-making,” Zeldes said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001a2e6fdjbmwjyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the group was supportive of the FDA’s decision to remove the boxed warning since it would surely encourage more conversations between women and their doctors about using hormone therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001b2e6fhd00gztx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fleishman cautioned, though, that not all hormone therapy products carry the same risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001c2e6fnyvqu9oz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is important to distinguish that systemic estrogen products — such as oral estrogen and transdermal patches, gels, and sprays — have a different safety profile than low-dose vaginal estrogen. Like all medications, systemic estrogen products are not without risk, and their use should be based on an individualized conversation between patients and their clinicians,” he said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001e2e6fpe1tsdw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All things considered, experts say, there’s still not enough evidence that taking hormones long-term can prevent chronic diseases of aging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001f2e6fam6pwjqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most women who are post-menopausal can probably take hormone replacement therapy,” said the Cleveland Clinic’s Cho. “However, what we now know from many, many years of hormone replacement trials is that there are women in whom we should really have sort of careful discussion, risk-benefit analysis before starting hormone replacement therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001g2e6fp3veyrbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If women have high blood pressure, they have high cholesterol, they are overweight, we should really pause before we start hormone replacement therapy and discuss the pros and cons.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001h2e6fz01skpsx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is good evidence that some types of hormone therapy reduce the risk for hip fracture, which many older adults struggle to recover from. The FDA approved hormone therapy for osteoporosis in 1988. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9632404/#:~:text=A%20population%2Dbased%20case%2Dcontrol%20study%20in%20Sweden%20found,gave%20similar%20risk%20estimates%20as%20oral%20regimens" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; estimated that each year of hormone therapy decreased the risk of hip fracture by about 6% per year of use, and data from the Framingham heart study found that the risk of hip fracture was reduced by 65% in current users of hormone therapy and about 30% in former users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001i2e6f1a1k8xab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But hormone therapy isn’t the only drug that treats bone health, so experts say women should weigh all their options with their doctors before making their decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001j2e6fqcpuwdv7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some worry that the FDA overshot the mark by removing the warning from all types of hormone therapies, especially pills, which expose the entire body to hormones and may increase a person’s risk for dangerous blood clots as much as fivefold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001k2e6fjejxsm2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would prefer a more nuanced change of the labeling if it was for systemic therapies,” said Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001l2e6f10026pxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that there are estrogen preparations, particularly oral ones, that the black box warning is still relevant for, and I think for the combinations of hormone therapy that were used in the [Women’s Health Initiative], I think those warnings are relevant. That’s where these data came from.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001m2e6fz52e5com@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Transdermal, or through-the-skin, estrogen creams, gels, patches and sprays don’t seem to be metabolized by the liver the same way pills are. As a result, there’s some evidence that transdermal forms of estrogen may not raise blood clot risk the same way pills do, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001n2e6fbovpi2gz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think if it was just the vaginal preparations, a lot of us have been saying for a long time that this would make sense,” Stuenkel said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001o2e6fs0p34u17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts are worried that doctors and patients will misread the FDA’s action as a green light to use hormones in all women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001p2e6f842zwmf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Already, says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, a physician at the Mayo Clinic who is medical director of the Menopause Society, says she’s had patients well past the age of menopause come in and ask to take estrogen. One wanted to know whether she should take it for tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, and to improve markers of heart health like homocysteine and cholesterol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001q2e6f3ejr6eoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a weird place to be in,” Faubion said. “With every patient, and I’m like, ‘All right, which side are we on?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001r2e6f6fn8w2qw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Invariably, Faubion finds herself having one of two very different kinds of conversations with patients about hormone therapy: Either “it’s not an anti-aging drug. You shouldn’t take it for everything” or “it’s not going to kill you, really. I promise it’s a safe therapy, and you can use it for your hot flashes,” she said. “But it’s one or the other.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olw001s2e6f1j0fdssa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2840561?widget=personalizedcontent&amp;amp;previousarticle=201958" target="_blank"&gt;recent viewpoint&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, Thurston, at the University of Pittsburgh, said she hopes this time that women and their doctors won’t treat hormone therapy like a miracle drug, but with the same consideration they’d give any other medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001t2e6fs0s9pwb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It has risks, it has benefits, it has indications, it has contraindications, but it is neither a panacea nor poison,” Thurston said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001u2e6fhhmlnqvz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every woman is different, and every woman’s needs during perimenopause and menopause will be unique. In recent years, the FDA has even approved two nonhormonal drugs that can help women manage their hot flashes, Veozah and Lynkuet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhwbdg0v002u3b6qpt9r6gob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said patients and their doctors should carefully consider their choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhvz8olx001v2e6fkkoacw7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And really, women deserve a range of different options,” Thurston said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Oddly, about 20% of the B cells in our bodies are &lt;i&gt;autoreactive&lt;/i&gt;. They target antigens belonging to our own tissues — not by design, but due to the random way B-cell diversity comes about: through sloppy replication, apparently engineered by evolution to ensure diversification. Fortunately, these B cells are typically in a dopey state of inertia, and they pretty much leave our tissues alone.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;But at times, somnolent autoreactive B cells become activated, take aim at our own tissues and instigate one of the disorders collectively called autoimmunity. Some awakened autoreactive B cells crank out antibodies that bind to proteins and DNA inside the nuclei of our cells. Such activated “antinuclear antibodies” — the hallmark of lupus — trigger damage to tissues randomly distributed throughout the body, because virtually all our body’s cells have nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of EBV-infected people (most of us, that is) have no idea they’re still sheltering a virus and never get lupus. But essentially everyone with lupus is EBV-infected, studies have shown. An EBV-lupus connection has been long suspected but never nailed down until now.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;h3&gt;The antinuclear B cell gets ornery&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Although latent EBV is ubiquitous in the sense that almost everybody carries it, it resides in only a tiny fraction of any given person’s B cells. As a result, until the new study, it was virtually impossible for existing methods to identify infected B cells and distinguish them from uninfected ones. But Robinson and his colleagues developed an extremely high-precision sequencing system that enabled them to do this. They found that fewer than 1 in 10,000 of a typical EBV-infected but otherwise healthy individual’s B cells are hosting a dormant EBV viral genome.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Employing their new EBV-infected-B-cell-identifying technology along with bioinformatics and cell-culture experimentation, the researchers found out how such small numbers of infected cells can cause a powerful immune attack on one’s own tissues. In lupus patients, the fraction of EBV-infected B cells rises to about 1 in 400 — a 25-fold difference.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;It’s known that the latent EBV, despite its near-total inactivity, nonetheless occasionally nudges the B cell it’s been snoozing in to produce a single viral protein, EBNA2. The researchers showed that this protein acts as a molecular switch — in geneticists’ language a “transcription factor” — activating a battery of genes in the B cell’s genome that had previously been at rest. At least two of the human genes switched on by EBNA2 are recipes for proteins that are, themselves, transcription factors that turn on a variety of other pro-inflammatory human genes.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The net effect of all these genetic fireworks is that the B cell becomes highly inflammatory: It dons its “professional antigen-presenting cell” uniform and starts stimulating other immune cells (called helper T cells) that happen to share a predilection for targeting cell-nuclear components. These helper T cells enlist multitudes of other antinuclear B cells as well as antinuclear killer T cells, vicious attack dogs of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;When that militia bulks up, it doesn’t matter whether any of the newly recruited antinuclear B cells are EBV-infected or not. (The vast majority of them aren’t.) If there are enough of them, the result is a bout of lupus.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;h3&gt;What comes next?&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Robinson said he suspects that this cascade of EBV-generated self-targeting B-cell activation might extend beyond lupus to other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease, where hints of EBV-initiated EBNA2 activity have been observed.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The million-dollar question: If about 95% of us are walking around with latent EBV in our B cells, why do some of us, but not all of us, get autoimmunity? Robinson speculates that perhaps only certain EBV strains spur the transformation of infected B cells into antigen-presenting “driver” cells that broadly activate huge numbers of antinuclear B cells.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Many companies are working on an EBV vaccine, and clinical trials of such a vaccine are underway. But that vaccine would have to be given soon after birth, Robinson noted, as such vaccines are unable to rid an already-infected person of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Stanford University’s Office of Technology Licensing has filed a provisional patent application on intellectual property associated with the study’s findings and technologies used to obtain them. Robinson, Younis and a third study co-author, Mahesh Pandit, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in immunology and rheumatology, are named inventors on the application. They are co-founders and stockholders of a company, EBVio Inc., a company exploring&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;an experimental lupus treatment, ultradeep B-cell depletion. This procedure involves total annihilation of all circulating B cells, which are replaced over the following few months by new, EBV-free B cells born continually in the bone marrow. Robinson is also a director of EBVio Inc. and a co-founder and shareholder of Flatiron Bio, LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cincinnati; the University of Massachusetts School of Medicine; the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center; and Rockefeller University contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grants R01AR078268, R01AI173189-01, PATHO-PH2-SUB_17_23 and R01AI024717), the VA Palo Alto Health Care System, the Lupus Research Alliance and the Brennan Family.&lt;/p&gt;

Nothing my husband and I tried could break her of the habit. Then miraculously, she stopped. When I mentioned my relief to my mother-in-law, she took credit for it. Then she told me her “solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not sure how to feel about this. On the one hand, I’m pissed my mother-in-law would lie to my daughter. On the other hand, it worked. Do I need to tell Wren the truth, or can my husband and I (at least for the time being) keep up the ruse?&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes, telling them the truth is cruel and heartless. (When my 5-year-old asked those questions, I said to him that most people live on this planet for 1,000 years before they go to cloud city in heaven to live forever, and that Santa and his sack of presents can take on a gaseous form and come up through the shower drains when there are no chimneys. I panicked!)&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, the 25-milligram oral version of Wegovy is awaiting regulatory approval, which could come by the end of the year. Notably, the drugmaker shared new data showing that the pill is both safe and effective. As a result, Dr. Jason Brett, Novo’s U.S. medical lead, said that the results give doctors and patients more information to help decide if this option is right for them, especially for people who don’t want to take injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meet Your ETF AI Analyst&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data from the OASIS 4 trial showed that the pill improved blood sugar levels and supported heart health. For example, 71.1% of prediabetic patients returned to normal blood sugar levels after 64 weeks, compared to just 33.3% in the placebo group. Those who lost at least 15% of their body weight also saw improvements in blood pressure, inflammation, and triglyceride levels. This was similar to the results seen with injectable Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the pill provided benefits to people across different groups, including women at all stages of menopause. Indeed, pre-menopausal women lost an average of 18.2% of their body weight, while peri- and post-menopausal women lost about 15%. It also helped people with low physical function feel better over time. More specifically, 77.3% reported noticeable improvement compared to 42.9% on placebo. It’s worth noting that the timing of this news is important for Novo, as it looks to strengthen its position in the obesity drug market &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/pfizer-clinches-10-billion-metsera-deal-as-novo-nordisk-loses-weight-loss-drug-battle"&gt;after losing a bidding war with Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-ticker="PFE" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pfe"&gt;(PFE)&lt;/a&gt; over Metsera &lt;a data-ticker="MTSR" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mtsr"&gt;(MTSR)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is NVO Stock a Good Buy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on NVO stock based on five Buys, three Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvo/forecast"&gt;average NVO price target&lt;/a&gt; of $60.16 per share implies 20.7% upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ethiopia’s Ministry of Health has confirmed an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in Jinka town, located in the South Ethiopia Regional State.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued Wednesday, the Ministry said eight suspected cases have been identified so far. Health authorities have deployed a rapid response team to the area to determine the cause, conduct laboratory testing, and prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Ministry, in collaboration with partners, is undertaking coordinated surveillance and response activities,” the statement said. “Community-level monitoring, contact tracing, and house-to-house case finding have been intensified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of hemorrhagic fever has not yet been confirmed, and samples are being analyzed to identify the specific virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents have been advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms such as unexplained bleeding, fever, diarrhea, or vomiting. The Ministry also urged the public to maintain strict hygiene practices, including regular handwashing and avoiding contact with individuals showing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health facilities across the region have been instructed to strengthen patient screening, isolate suspected cases, and promptly report any new infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further updates will be provided once laboratory results are available, the Ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We really do 'fall' asleep, a new study shows. Far from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-to-silence-your-thoughts-and-drift-off-to-sleep-an-expert-explains"&gt;gently drifting off&lt;/a&gt;, the brain rapidly transitions into sleep after passing a tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using brain scans taken from thousands of volunteers, researchers from Imperial College London (ICL) and the University of Surrey in the UK discovered a surprisingly sudden change in electrical activity around 4.5 minutes before the onset of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We discovered that falling asleep is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory"&gt;bifurcation&lt;/a&gt;, not a gradual process, with a clear tipping point that can be predicted in real time," &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/270894/falling-asleep-follows-brain-tipping-point/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ICL neuroscientist Nir Grossman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-used-to-sleep-twice-every-night-heres-why-it-vanished"&gt;Humans Used to Sleep Twice Every Night. Here's Why It Vanished.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ability to track how individual brains fall asleep has profound implications for our understanding of the sleep process and for developing new treatments for people who struggle with falling asleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's model converted 47 features of brain activity captured by an electroencephalogram (EEG) into an abstract mathematical space. This allowed them to record changes in the brain between bedtime and sleep, which, when mapped as a trajectory, resembles a ball rolling down a steepening slope towards a fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180977" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180977" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sleep-feature-space-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-180977 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sleep-feature-space-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/sleep-feature-space-1-600x234.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180977" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphical illustration of the computational framework, transforming one-dimensional EEG data (a) into a many-dimensional space (b) to calculate how close someone is to sleep when they nod off (c).

Permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a pilot study, published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2511778" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, a novel gene therapy was able to reduce patients’ low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol – 'bad' cholesterol – by almost 50 per cent, as well as triglycerides by an average of 55 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future trials continue to be successful, then the single, one-off treatment could replace the daily cocktail of drugs millions take to control their cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are fats that our livers naturally produce. If they build up in our blood, however, they can cause fatty deposits. These can lead to cardiovascular disease, which is responsible for 1 in 3 deaths in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are associated with major adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/the-discoveries-bringing-an-end-to-heart-attacks"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, stroke or death,” &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/steven-nissen/4268279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Steven Nissen&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner School of Medicine, in the US, told &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nissen was part of a group that hoped to reduce people’s cholesterol levels by targeting the ANGPTL3 gene, which is associated with LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 1 in 250 people have a mutation that turns this gene off. As a result, these people have low levels of both blood fats. “Importantly, they also have a low incidence of cardiovascular disease,” said Nissen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, who gets the benefit of this mutation isn’t solely up to the genetic lottery anymore, thanks to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/crispr"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt;, the gene-editing technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/11/Purple-.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="DNA with a section pulled out by tweezers" class="wp-image-209201"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;CRISPR selectively modifies DNA by targeting specific genes. - Credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using CRISPR, Nissen and his colleagues were able to tailor the therapy to switch off the ANGPTL3 gene in the liver. It was then administered, via an infusion, to 15 patients for an preliminary trial to test its safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within two weeks, the treatment substantially lowered the participants’ LDL and triglyceride levels. The study confirmed they remained low 60 days later, but according to Nissen, “These changes are expected to be permanent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors recommend keeping LDL cholesterol levels below 100mg/dL for optimal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/tags/the-heart"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; health. While diet and exercise can help, many people struggle to meet this goal, particularly those with a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medications can help, but none of them lower both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides simultaneously. As a result, people often have to take multiple daily medications throughout their lives to manage their cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The next phase of the trial will begin within a few months and involve more patients with elevations in LDL cholesterol or triglycerides,” said Nissen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these continue to be successful, then the medication could offer a long-term weapon in the quest to defeat one of the world’s biggest killers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When we lose weight, we don’t just lose body fat – we lose muscle, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be a problem for many reasons, because skeletal muscle is far more than the tissue that helps us move. It plays a crucial role in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-2395-3-9"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;, regulating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00033.2024"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/54.5.B207"&gt;healthy ageing&lt;/a&gt;. Losing muscle mass is linked to a reduced mobility, increased injury risk and is thought to potentially impair long-term weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With millions of people now using weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic, understanding what impact this muscle loss &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.6586"&gt;might have on their health&lt;/a&gt; is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss of muscle mass is also a significant challenge for athletes too, as many sports encourage them to keep body weight low while still maintaining demanding training loads and keeping their power-output high. So an energy deficit can put significant stress on an athlete’s body – but to what extent it affects their normal function, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40279-024-02108-y"&gt;is unclear&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite these widespread implications, we still know surprisingly little about how human muscle responds at the molecular level to the combination of calorie restriction and exercise. Understanding what happens to muscle when exercising in a calorie deficit is extremely important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202502384RR"&gt;Newly published research&lt;/a&gt; from myself and my colleagues casts light on this exact topic. We showed that weight loss accompanied by aerobic exercise might not be that bad for the muscles after all – and indeed it may have positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recruited ten healthy, fit young men who completed two tightly controlled five-day experimental trials in our laboratory. During their first trial period, they consumed enough calories to maintain their body weight. But during the second, we reduced their daily calorie intake by 78% – a severe energy deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During both trials, participants completed a tightly-controlled, 90-minute low- to moderate-intensity cycling exercise three times during each five-day period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the trials, we measured blood markers such as glucose, ketones, fatty acids and key hormones linked to energy preservation. We did this to determine if – and to what extent – the energy deficit was affecting them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also collected muscle biopsies before and after each testing period. Using an advanced method called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9802-9_9"&gt;dynamic proteomic profiling&lt;/a&gt;, we analysed the production and abundance of hundreds of muscle proteins. This allowed us to build a detailed picture of how muscle adapts to sudden, substantial calorie restriction – even when exercise demands are maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the five days in an energy deficit, participants lost about 3kg. Hormones such as leptin, T3 and IGF-1 also dropped sharply – clear signs the body was getting into an energy preservation mode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But inside the muscle itself, something more unexpected was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Muscle tissue changes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The muscle tissue mounted a strong and surprisingly positive response to the combination of exercise and calorie restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we saw an increase in the amount of mitochondrial proteins within the muscle – and these proteins were also being created more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are the power generators inside cells. They convert fat and carbohydrates into usable energy. Higher amounts of mitochondrial proteins, and faster production of them, are hallmarks of a healthier and more efficient muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The positive changes we saw within the muscle tissue correlated with a more youthful muscle profile.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/mans-grip-on-his-painful-elbow-2327824925"&gt;BigBlueStudio/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also saw a clear decrease in the amount and production of collagen and collagen-related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collagen is an abundant protein that plays a role in providing structure and strength to the muscle. However, collagen tends to accumulate in excess as we age – contributing to stiffness and impaired function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these changes resemble a shift toward a more metabolically youthful muscle profile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of response has also been seen in long-term calorie-restriction &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2019.12.002"&gt;studies in monkeys&lt;/a&gt;. But this is the first time it has been demonstrated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Healthier ageing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it seems paradoxical that the body would invest energy in maintaining or improving muscle during a time of scarcity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muscle tissue is demanding and costly to maintain – and movement is energetically expensive, too. Shouldn’t the body simply reduce muscle activity to save energy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question may lie in our evolutionary past. Humans evolved as hunter-gatherers, who often faced periods of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30573-1"&gt;low food availability&lt;/a&gt;. During those times, the ability to move efficiently – to walk and run long distances, forage or hunt – was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-01876-x"&gt;essential for survival&lt;/a&gt;. A body that shut down muscle function during hunger would have been less likely to survive and reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the protective response we observed may reflect deep evolutionary adaptations: muscles stay ready to move even when fuel is running low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study involved a small number of young men who were deliberately following an extreme energy deficit for a short period of time. As such, we cannot assume identical responses in women, older adults or people who are obese or have chronic health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to compare weight loss with and without exercise, examine less extreme calorie deficits, include women and older adults, and measure how these molecular changes translate into actual physical performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, our findings support the idea that exercise during weight loss may protect muscle quality – and may even enhance characteristics linked to healthier ageing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings also have key implications for many people. People who are taking weight loss drugs or trying to lose weight may benefit from structured exercise to help them preserve muscle quality. Older adults, who are more vulnerable to muscle loss, may especially benefit from exercising while losing weight. Athletes may approach any energy deficit with care, but know that muscle keeps adapting to exercise stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study shows that human muscle is remarkably resilient. Even under severe stress, when much of the body is trying to conserve energy, muscle tissue seems to respond robustly – boosting its energy-producing machinery and limiting age-related degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, losing weight and exercising doesn’t just help preserve muscle – it may help keep it younger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Society is fascinated with health, fitness and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/longevity-20168"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;. This obsession has spawned a multi-million pound industry centred around pushing the latest cutting-edge science, lifestyle modifications and products that claim to prevent ageing and live as long as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the secret to a long life doesn’t have to be so complicated. There are many simple things everyone can do to slow down time and feel younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about age, we aren’t always talking about how many candles are on your birthday cake. We actually have two different ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is of course chronological age. This is the number of years you’ve been alive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also have a “&lt;a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/abc/a/mJmKp8SPc4fcQWNQ7HhyMKf/?lang=en"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;.” This is sometimes referred to as “true age” or “internal body age.” This refers to how well all of the body’s internal systems are functioning by looking for signs of ageing in the cells, blood and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.101020"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research indicates that a person’s biological age, rather than their chronological age, is related to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article-pdf/76/7/1295/38620245/glab069.pdf"&gt;how long they live&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s say you looked at two 60-year-old people. The person whose biological age is younger would be more likely to outlive the person who had a higher biological age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are now many ways to measure your biological age with &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8856/5/2/28"&gt;epigenetic testing&lt;/a&gt;, which only requires a little bit of spit and can be done at home. The saliva sample is then processed in a lab where the &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15592294.2018.1461295"&gt;DNA is extracted&lt;/a&gt; to get information about what’s happening in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The everyday lifestyle choices we make affects our biological age. While some of the decisions we make can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.18611"&gt;increase it&lt;/a&gt; (such as drinking, smoking or being inactive), other factors can actually turn back the clock. Thus, how long we live may truly be in our hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five evidence-backed ways of reducing your biological age:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Run away from ageing – literally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being more physically active and regularly exercising throughout life reduces risk of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.07.236"&gt;death from all causes&lt;/a&gt; – directly increasing longevity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also never too late to get started. One study found that sedentary people who adopted an eight-week exercise programme (60 minute workouts done three times a week) &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2023.2228388"&gt;reversed their biological age&lt;/a&gt; by around two years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mixture of strength and endurance exercises done three to four times a week (with sessions as short as 23 minutes) is also shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.13841"&gt;significantly reduce ageing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise influences something called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.101020"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;, a process which controls whether certain genes are “on” or “off.” As we age it’s natural that our genes start switching off – this is why we get winkles and grey hair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But exercise helps to slow these processes down, meaning the genes that help do important functions in the body continue doing their job for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. You are what you eat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15112431"&gt;healthier food choices&lt;/a&gt; directly reduces biological age. This effect is even greater in those with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/about/index.html"&gt;chronic disease&lt;/a&gt; and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One study, which looked at nearly 2,700 women, found that adopting healthier eating patterns for 6-12 months was a key factor in staying &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqab307"&gt;younger for longer&lt;/a&gt;. This diet was also shown to slow ageing by an average of 2.4 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;

              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Healthier foods choices may lower your biological age by years.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/salmon-superfood-salad-grilled-fish-kale-2390870025"&gt;Sea Wave/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-00841-x"&gt;Healthier food choices&lt;/a&gt; included eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fish, lean proteins and healthy fats (such as oil) and reducing intake of red meat, saturated fat, added sugars and sodium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-balanced diet provides antioxidants, vitamins and anti-inflammatory compounds that help cells repair damage and reduce stress on our DNA. These nutrients also influence DNA methylation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Improve sleep habits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep is one of the strongest predictors of healthy ageing because it affects nearly every bodily system. Good quality sleep allows the body to repair DNA, restore hormonal balance, reduce inflammation and clear &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1134/S2079057025600053"&gt;cellular waste&lt;/a&gt; – helping the immune, metabolic and nervous systems stay youthful and resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One review showed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coemr.2021.03.021"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; is directly associated with how fast we age. People who sleep less than five hours per night have a significantly increased risk of age-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a large UK study of nearly 200,000 participants found that those on shift work – and particularly night shifts – had a biological age &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01575-z"&gt;around one year higher&lt;/a&gt; than their counterparts who worked at normal hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Avoid unhealthy vices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13148-023-01577-8"&gt;vaping&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-025-01485-x"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.205153"&gt;drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt; are the strongest and most consistent accelerators of ageing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smoking, for instance, is shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13148-019-0777-z"&gt;rapidly age&lt;/a&gt; the lungs by up to 4.3 years and the airway cells by nearly five years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a study looking at 8,046 adults aged 30–79 years old found that consuming any amount of alcohol was associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16501"&gt;accelerated biological ageing&lt;/a&gt;. The more alcohol consumed the more age is accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These habits speed up biological ageing because they directly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15376516.2018.1528650"&gt;damage DNA&lt;/a&gt;, increase inflammation and overload cells with stress. This causes the body and organs to work harder – ageing them quicker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Master your mind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress management is key. Research shows that being able to regulate emotions and manage stress levels &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01735-7"&gt;predicts age acceleration&lt;/a&gt;. Another study found that working more than 40 hours a week on average &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.203872"&gt;increased biological age by two years&lt;/a&gt;, probably due to the stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress can directly accelerate biological age due to the way it affects hormonal response, damages DNA and reduces immunity. Stress can also indirectly affect other factors that may accelerate age, such as diet, sleep and whether we drink or smoke. This is why having a set of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559031/"&gt;positive coping mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; to manage stress is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01597-7"&gt;growing body of research&lt;/a&gt; is also showing that factors such as loneliness, exposure to extreme heat and cold, air pollution and our environment (such as living in deprived areas) can all also affect how we age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the affect of these factors on age may vary depending on the person, their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3295054/"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, how long they’ve stuck with these lifestyle habits and other factors at play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this gives insight into how changing even small habits can positively improve health and well-being and, in some cases, turn back the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

In accordance with Danish legislation, the above-mentioned ethics committee waived the need for specific informed consent in biomedical research based on existing biobanks. iPSYCH was approved by the ethics committee in 2012, with subsequent amendments in 2013, 2015 and 2018. More details can be found at &lt;a href="https://ipsych.dk/en/data-security/health-research-and-ethical-approval"&gt;https://ipsych.dk/en/data-security/health-research-and-ethical-approval&lt;/a&gt;. New Danish legislation (effective from January 2024) introduces the possibility for participants to opt out of studies that are exempt from active informed consent. After consulting with the Ethics Committees and patient organizations, iPSYCH contacted all participants (around 140,000) in the iPSYCH cohort in June 2025 and offered the possibility of opting out of new genetic studies initiated henceforth. Overall, 1.8% of the iPSYCH participants chose to opt out, and their data will be deleted from the active research database. Data included in finalized and ongoing studies will not be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical data were approved by the ethics committee at the University of Würzburg in Germany. In the Netherlands, they were approved by the regional ethics committee (Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek: CMO Regio Arnhem—Nijmegen; protocol III.04.0403 and 2014/290; ABR: NL47721.091.14) and the Institutional Review Board of the Radboud University Medical Center. Participants were included at the Department of Psychiatry at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre. All participants in the German and Dutch samples provided signed informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Samples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec16"&gt;iPSYCH&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individuals selected for exome sequencing were part of the iPSYCH cohort, which has been described in detail elsewhere&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 15" title="Bybjerg-Grauholm, J. et al.

None of the individuals was diagnosed with ID. They were recruited as part of the International Multicenter Persistent ADHD Collaboration (IMpACT) at two sites: Radboud University Medical Center, the Netherlands, and University Hospital Würzburg, Germany. In analyses of these clinical samples, we used control samples from individuals recruited together with the clinical cases at the IMpACT site at Radboud University Medical Center (ADHD-screened controls), and from 1,766 German control individuals who were recruited from the German MI Family Study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 52" title="Broeckel, U. et al.

Next, we did thorough, multiple-round quality checks on the samples and the genetic variations using Hail 0.1. Samples were removed if they lacked complete phenotype information; if the imputed sex was inconsistent with the reported sex in the registries; if duplicates or genetic outliers were identified by principal component analysis (PCA); if they had an estimated level of contamination greater than 5%; or if they had an estimated level of chimeric reads higher than 5%. In addition, one of each pair of related samples was removed if the pairwise pi-hat value was 0.2 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genotypes were removed if they did not pass GATK variant quality score recalibration (VQSR) or had a read depth lower than 10 or higher than 1,000. QC was done in Hail 0.1. Homozygous alleles were removed if they had reference calls with a genotype quality lower than 25, homozygous alternate alleles with PL(HomRef) (that is, the phred-scaled likelihood of being homozygous reference) &amp;lt; 25 or less than 90% of reads supporting the alternate allele. Heterozygous alleles were removed if they had PL(HomRef) &amp;lt; 25 or less than 25% of reads supporting the alternate allele, less than 90% informative reads (that is, number of reads supporting the reference allele plus number of reads supporting the alternate allele &amp;lt; 90% of the read depth) or a probability of the allele balance (calculated from a binomial distribution centred on 0.5) less than 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;. After these filters were applied, variants with a call rate lower than 90% were removed, then samples with a call rate lower than 95%, and then variants with a call rate lower than 95% were removed. After QC, 28,448 individuals and 1,362,971 variants remained for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, we selected for this study the individuals diagnosed with ADHD and controls as described above, resulting in 8,895 cases and 9,001 controls (see Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM3"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt; for sample of individuals with other ancestries not included in this study). Finally, we defined rare variants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 565,053) as those with an allele count no higher than five across our dataset (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 17,896) and the exome subset of gnomAD used in this study (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 44,779).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Clinical samples&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological samples collected at the Dutch and German IMpACT sites were sequenced at BGI, Shenzhen, China. The coding regions of the DNA were targeted using BGI´s exome-capture kit (developed by Beijing Genomics Institute targeting 58.8 Mb) and paired-end sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, with an average sequencing depth of 50×. The exome-sequencing data obtained from dbGaP were generated at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT using Illumina’s ICE Capture reagent kit, and sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500. Bam files for all samples (clinical cases and dbGaP controls) were reprocessed together, adhering to the same QC approach described above for the iPSYCH samples. After this QC process, 2,816 samples, consisting of 1,078 individuals with ADHD and 1,738 controls, remained for further analysis. We were not able to obtain a group of completely homogenous individuals after the exclusion of genetic outliers based on PCA (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;), and thus, to minimize the effect of population stratification in subsequent analyses, we aimed at getting as close to de novo mutations as possible; we therefore included only ultra-rare variants, defined as singletons not in the non-psychiatric subsample of individuals in the ExAC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Lek, M. et al.

Following the same approach, the load of rare variants across variant categories in female individuals with ADHD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2,265) was compared with male individuals with ADHD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 6,630), both with and without individuals with ID (1,827 female individuals without ID; 5,414 male individuals without ID). The burdens in all genes and genes stratified by their pLI score were evaluated. Covariates included in analyses of iPSYCH samples were: birth year, sex, the first ten principal components (PCs) from PCA (performed after excluding non-European samples), total number of variants, number of rare synonymous variants, percentage of exome target covered at a read depth of at least 20, mean read depth at sites within the exome target passing VQSR, and sequencing wave (one-hot encoded).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burden of different types of variant categories in gene sets was also tested for the clinical samples following the approach described above but restricting to ultra-rare variants and including the following covariates: sex, total number of variants, number of ultra-rare synonymous variants, number of all variants and PC1–PC10 from PCA (performed after excluding individuals with non-European genetic ancestry).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Gene-based burden tests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To increase power for gene discovery, we combined iPSYCH data with a subset of 44,779 individuals from gnomAD&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 17" title="Karczewski, K.

Only variants in high-confidence regions for the two datasets were included, defined as regions in which at least 80% of the samples in both datasets had at least 10× sequencing coverage (based on analysis of bam files for the Danish samples and on coverage summary tables for gnomAD). To avoid biases caused by variations in call rates between cases (entirely iPSYCH) and controls (83.3% gnomAD), all autosomal genes with higher rates of rare synonymous variants in cases than controls were excluded (15,603 out of 18,866 autosomal genes remained; 3,263 excluded).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variants were grouped depending on their impact on ADHD: class I variants include rPTVs and rare missense variants with MPC &amp;gt; 3 (rSevereDMVs); class II variants include missense variants with 2 ≤ MPC ≤ 3 (rModerateDMVs). Gene-based burden analysis was performed with a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Only genes with an increased load of class I (3,698 genes) and/or class II (1,026 genes) variants in cases compared with controls were considered. We did not consider genes with higher numbers of class I and II variants in controls, because such observations could be caused by a generally higher number of variants in controls, owing to the previous filtering step in which only genes with a higher number of rare synonymous variants in controls than in cases were retained. A small number of genes (347) had an increased load of both class I and class II variants in cases, and for these genes we also estimated the combined impact of class I and class II variants in a meta-analysis using the weighted &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score method. Weights were the ratio of the standardized effect sizes observed for the classes in enrichment analysis of constrained genes. For the 347 genes, we used the minimum &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value across the three analyses done for these genes. In total, we tested 15,603 genes (347 genes were tested three times) resulting in 16,297 tests. We considered a gene significantly associated with ADHD if the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value was lower than 0.05/16,297 = 3.07 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As described above, genes with an increased rate of rare synonymous variants in individuals with ADHD relative to controls were excluded to avoid biases when combining iPSYCH and gnomAD data. When inspecting the QQ-plot of rare synonymous variants (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;), the plot revealed the anticipated pattern of inflation that corresponds to our gene selection strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the clinical sample, we performed a gene-based burden test of class I variants using emmaxCMC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 57" title="Li, B. &amp;amp; Leal, S.

This method allows for the incorporation of a kinship matrix to account for potential remaining population stratification among individuals. We generated the kinship matrix using ‘epacts make-kin --min-maf 0.01 --remove-complex’. In addition, we included sex, the number of ultra-rare synonymous variants, the number of all variants and PC1–PC10 from PCA (performed after excluding non-European samples) as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Gene-set analyses in the clinical sample&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested for increased load of ultra-rare class I and class II variants in ADHD compared with controls in the clinical sample. We used different &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-value thresholds from the gene-based burden test in iPSYCH + gnomAD samples to define three ADHD rare-variant risk gene sets: &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; (20 genes), &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (316 genes) and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (583 genes) (gene sets are listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM3"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;). The control group included 870 with cardiovascular disease and 896 without, so we also tested for the potential difference in ultra-rare class I variants across the two groups in the three ADHD gene sets. Only class I variants were tested, because these were the only type of variants with a tendency to be overrepresented in clinical ADHD cases versus controls (&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Information&lt;/a&gt;, Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM1"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09702-8#MOESM3"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;). The gene sets were tested using logistic regression with sex, number of ultra-rare synonymous variants, number of all variants, and PC1–PC10 from PCA (performed after excluding non-European samples) as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;X-chromosome analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the distinct regions of the X chromosome, we applied region-specific thresholds to define rare variants: in the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs), rare variants were defined as those with an allele count of five or less following what was done for the autosomes. In non-pseudoautosomal regions (nonPARs), the rare-variant threshold was adjusted to an allele count of three of less to account for the hemizygosity in male individuals. This adjustment was derived using a scaling factor based on the relative contributions of male individuals and female individuals in iPSYCH (6,002 female and 11,894 male individuals) and subset of gnomAD used in this study (19,916 female and 24,863 male individuals):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$5\times \frac{({{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}}+2\times {{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{f}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}})}{2\times ({{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}}+{{\rm{n}}{\rm{u}}{\rm{m}}}_{{\rm{f}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}})}=3.53$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variants were categorized into class I, class II and synonymous variants, using the same criteria applied for autosomal variants. In the burden test of male individuals, the number of alleles for nonPAR variants was counted as two to account for hemizygosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logistic regression was performed on three gene sets stratified by their pLI score, comparing the following groups of individuals: ADHD versus controls; ADHD without ID versus controls; ADHD with ID versus controls; and ADHD with ID versus ADHD without ID. Covariates included birth year, sex, the first ten PCs from PCA (non-European samples excluded), total variant count, rare synonymous variant count, exome target coverage (percentage ≥ 20×), mean read depth at target sites and sequencing batch (one-hot encoded). In addition, sex-stratified analyses were performed using the same approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For gene discovery on the X chromosome, we applied the same approach as for autosomes when combining iPSYCH data with gnomAD. We excluded genes with higher numbers of synonymous variants in individuals with ADHD than in controls and retained genes with a higher rate of class I variants in cases than in controls (78 genes included) or a higher number of class II variants (44 genes). We performed gene-based burden analysis separately for male individuals and female individuals, in which we, for each gene, compared the number of individuals with ADHD carrying at least one class I or class II variant to the number found for control individuals, using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Notably, six genes had both increased class I and II variants in cases compared with controls; for these genes, a meta-analysis was used to combine the effect of class I and class II variants using the weighted &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score method. The weight was determined as the ratio of the standardized effect sizes observed for class I and class II variants in the enrichment analysis of constrained genes on chromosome X (weight = 1.03/1.86 = 0.55). In total, we performed 78 × 3 tests for class I variants (female, male and combined), 44 × 3 tests for class II variants and 6 tests for combining class I and II, resulting in a total of 372 tests. The Bonferroni correction threshold for statistical significance was set at &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1.34 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Rare burden heritability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used BHR&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 26" title="Weiner, D.

We used BHR to estimate the heritability of ADHD explained by the load of rare class I, class II and synonymous variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variant-level summary statistics associated with ADHD, including allele count and allele frequency from the iPSYCH exome data, were used as input for BHR. The method regresses gene burden test statistics (based on the variant category being evaluated) against burden scores that correspond to the combined allele frequency. The slope of the regression represents the burden heritability and confounding factors such as population stratification, are controlled through the intercept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;PPI-network analyses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ANK2 PPI networks were derived from published IP–MS datasets included in Table S2 of a previous study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 27" title="Pintacuda, G. et al.

The expression data for the highly variable genes were scaled and used as input in PCA generated using the singular value decomposition (SVD) solver method in the ‘arpack’ algorithm implemented in Scanpy. PCs from the PCAs were then used to compute a neighbourhood graph generated using the Scanpy function ‘pp.neighbors’, which afterwards was embedded and visualized as a UMAP constructed with the Scanpy function tl.umap. For study I, the neighbourhood graph was constructed with the first 20 PCs and ‘n_neighbors’ set to 100. For study II, the neighbourhood graph was constructed with the first 40 PCs and ‘n_neighbors’ set to 30 for each of the 3 datasets. The parameters were set based on visual inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the&lt;i&gt; P&lt;/i&gt; values from the top 100 most associated genes from the gene-discovery analysis of iPSYCH + gnomAD samples as input for scDRS analysis, which was done separately for the above-described data from studies I, II and III. The number of genes was set to 100, which is the recommended minimum number of genes for the method. The method computes, on the basis of the expression of these 100 most significant genes, one raw disease score per cell. In addition, 1,000 raw control scores were computed for each cell. The control scores were generated using Monte Carlo sampling, in which 1,000 gene sets were produced, each consisting of 100 genes with similar gene size, mean gene expression and expression variance to that observed for the disease gene set. The computation of scores was corrected for relevant covariates (see below) and the number of genes in each of the cells. The normalized disease score was compared with the empirical normalized control score distribution to estimate a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value that quantifies the association between the disease genes and their expression in individual cells. These scores were used in the downstream scDRS cell-type-level analysis to test the association between the scores and predefined cell types using a &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test and the top 5% quantile of the disease score of cells from the given cell type.

Logistic regression of ADHD status on the nine dummy variables was performed to estimate the impact on ADHD risk in each PGS pentile using individuals in the first pentile with no class I variants in constrained genes as reference. This was done separately for individuals with no class I variants in constrained genes and for individuals with at least one class I variant in constrained genes.

This comparison was designed to be simultaneous. To start with, we identified individuals diagnosed with either ADHD or ASD by the end of 2016, along with a control group in the quality-controlled iPSYCH data (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 28,448). Subsequently, we defined and classified the rare variants into class I, class II and synonymous categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a C-alpha test between ADHD without ASD (ADHD only) and ASD without ADHD (ASD only), regardless of ID comorbidity. In addition, we stratified the samples by the presence or absence of ID to perform C-alpha tests between ADHD only and ASD only.

&lt;p id="5bca948b-6d1e-4da9-b38e-5571ecb61607"&gt;Exercise has big benefits for the brain, but the exact reasons why have been mysterious. Now, new studies suggest that exercised muscles release brain-boosting substances into the blood — and at least in lab animals, that boost can be transferred from one individual to another via an injection of those substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, common explanations for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/features/boost-brain-health.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/features/boost-brain-health.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;why regular physical activity is good for the brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed to better blood flow, less stress and a stronger heart. But those ideas didn't fully explain how movement directly affected neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="5bca948b-6d1e-4da9-b38e-5571ecb61607-2"&gt;Clues are emerging from animal research.

The researchers don't yet know whether the vesicles entered the brain or acted indirectly through other bodily signals. But Connolly explained that the vesicles themselves carried many proteins linked to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/antioxidants" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/antioxidants"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antioxidant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; defenses and neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, this surge in new brain cells may matter only if those cells survive long enough to fully integrate into the brain's existing structure, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/u/p.j.lucassen/p.j.lucassen.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/u/p.j.lucassen/p.j.lucassen.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paul Lucassen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at the University of Amsterdam who was not part of the study. The study zoomed in on "newborn neurons that still need weeks to grow and wire themselves into the brain's existing circuits," he told Live Science in an email. "Only when they find their place in the network can they help shape learning and memory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f16c9f77-7ce7-4963-b50d-db5185a8b94b"&gt;Connolly said the next step is to test whether these vesicles can restore neurogenesis and improve memory in laboratory models of brain diseases — avenues that some researchers are already exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-fbWGzb8jjpSsQRZDuwLwJf" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-fbWGzb8jjpSsQRZDuwLwJf slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another study, published earlier this year in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)00011-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2589004225000112%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)00011-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2589004225000112%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;iScience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, scientists used a well-established mouse model of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/dementia-facts-about-alzheimers-and-other-forms-of-dementia" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/dementia-facts-about-alzheimers-and-other-forms-of-dementia"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (AD). In AD, neurons malfunction and die off over time in part due to a buildup of abnormal proteins, including amyloid and tau. In the experiment, one set of mice ran voluntarily on wheels for six months while another group was sedentary; the active mice showed less amyloid buildup in the cortex and better metabolism and memory than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another part of that study, the researchers gave vesicles from mice that had just exercised to sedentary Alzheimer's-model animals. The vesicles, delivered through the nose, reproduced the metabolic benefits but didn't improve memory or clearly reduce amyloid levels, they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8f99a949-66ff-4ac1-86e7-ef40909b5adc"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/mark-febbraio/" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/mark-febbraio/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Febbraio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Monash University and a member of the research team, explained that the intranasal delivery method may have affected memory outcomes because it requires light anesthesia. He told Live Science in an email that his group is now running follow-up experiments with human participants, comparing vesicles heading to and from the brain during exercise. Preliminary results hint that the vesicles heading toward the brain may be enriched for proteins affecting cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vesicles may be only one piece of this puzzle. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_9846506342847547781&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-025-03955-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fexercise%2Fbrain-benefits-of-exercise-come-from-the-bloodstream-and-they-may-be-transferrable-mouse-study-finds" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03955-6" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-025-03955-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fexercise%2Fbrain-benefits-of-exercise-come-from-the-bloodstream-and-they-may-be-transferrable-mouse-study-finds" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Other recent studies in humans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest that regular exercise likely helps the brain via multiple biological pathways.

It’s a mixed answer, but the bright spot is scientific progress on vaccines. The Covid vaccines were produced faster than any previous effort, and are credited with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;saving millions of lives from 2021&lt;/a&gt; onwards. The mRNA vaccines – Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna – were designed within days of the Sars-CoV-2 genome being published in January 2020, and went into safety trials over the following months before finally being approved in the UK at the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But could they have additional benefits? According to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03432-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in Nature, mRNA vaccines seem to trigger a powerful immune response that increases the median survival time by about 75% for certain cancer patients. These findings – which are being further developed – could indicate the power of repurposing vaccines and medicines that have already passed trials for safety and are available at reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;How could Covid vaccines play a part in cancer treatment? Cancer develops when normal cells in the body grow and divide without control. Usually, cell division is strictly controlled, but when certain mutations happen – sometimes caused by tobacco, or radiation, inherited genetic factors or environmental exposure – the body is no longer able to stop uncontrolled cell growth. These cells (often referred to as malignant) build up to form a tumour – an abnormal growth. To keep growing, these cells create new blood vessels to feed themselves and start to spread around the body – called metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Our immune system is excellent at recognising invaders in our body – think of viruses or bacteria – but given that cancerous cells are part of our body, they prove hard for our immune system to distinguish from healthy cells. In treating cancer, doctors have several options. Surgery or radiotherapy is usually the start, to simply remove or target localised cancerous cells. If they have spread throughout the body, then chemotherapy is necessary: basically “nuking” the body to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs target cells that divide quickly to stop tumours growing, but this means they also kill off healthy cells in hair follicles, the stomach lining and bone marrow. It’s a blunt and barbaric intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Immunotherapy is a more targeted approach: its aim is to prime the immune system to attack only cancerous cells. Most of the research efforts here have focused on developing targeted vaccines and drugs for specific cancers, which means a long and expensive process of testing for safety, efficacy and dosage. But what appears to happen with mRNA vaccines is something different: it looks as if they activate the immune system in general, and this helps the body fight cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers in the US looked at the medical records of patients with stage 3 and stage 4 lung cancer treated between 2015 and 2022 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Of those, 180 patients had received a Covid mRNA vaccine – either Pfizer or Moderna – within 100 days of starting immunotherapy treatment. In this observational study, the researchers compared them with 704 patients who had the same drugs but did not have the Covid jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After controlling for age, disease severity and other confounding factors, the results were striking: vaccinated patients lived a median of 37.3 months compared with 20.6 months in the unvaccinated group. Three years after starting treatment, 55.7% of vaccinated patients were alive compared with 30.8% of those who weren’t. A similar pattern was found when looking at a second group of patients with metastatic melanoma (a skin cancer that has spread around the body). The same benefit was found regardless of whether it was Pfizer or Moderna, but not in non-mRNA Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The gains are significant and far beyond the norm for most cancer drugs. A study &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10333065/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reviewing the clinical impact&lt;/a&gt; of 124 new cancer drugs approved by the US FDA between 2003 and 2021 found that, on average, new drugs increased median overall survival only by 2.8 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To delve deeper into these findings, scientists studied the impact of mRNA vaccines in mice. They found that pairing an mRNA vaccine with immunotherapy helped activate the immune system and turn previously hidden (“cold”) tumours into recognisable ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What could explain this? The researchers suggest that mRNA vaccines act as a flare, activating immune cells throughout the body. This doesn’t directly target cancer, but primes the immune system to be more alert and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If these findings are confirmed in other studies, this could revolutionise how cancer is treated. As &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/study-finds-covid-19-mrna-vaccine-sparks-immune-response-to-fight-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dr Elias Sayour,&lt;/a&gt; an oncologist and a co-author of the study, said: “We could design an even better non-specific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all patients.” Because Covid mRNA vaccines have already been tested for safety in millions of people, researchers see potential in repurposing them as a low-risk, inexpensive way to boost the immune system alongside traditional cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Matters of Opinion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"matters-of-opinion","successDescription":"Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The findings come from an observational study – that is, looking back at medical records of patients, rather than one designed from the ground up to test this effect – meaning it can show association, not causation. Randomised control trials (or RCTs) are needed to confirm whether it is indeed the vaccine making the difference. Animal studies are also needed to further examine the exact biological mechanism beyond just general immune system activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But just imagine having more precise and effective cancer treatments without the heavy toll and side-effects of chemotherapy. I remember my father suffering through round after round of chemo and wondering if the cure was worse than the disease. The Nature study is a reminder that science often advances in surprising ways. The mRNA Covid vaccines may not only have saved lives during the pandemic – they might also save lives from cancer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Chavda-Sitaram tries to avoid &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/5-common-mistakes-for-balanced-blood-sugar-dietitian-tips-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;refined sugar&lt;/a&gt; except on special occasions or if she's really craving it. Refined sugars like corn syrup and table sugar have a different effect on the body to sugars found in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sources like fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, because they don't contain fiber or healthy fats, which help keep blood sugar levels stable. Over time, too many spikes can lead to insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating lots of sugar is linked to a higher risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, but there's also some evidence to suggest it impacts our skin. A 2022 systematic review published in the journal JAAD International found a "modest yet significant" link between a diet high in refined sugar and acne, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You need to have that slice of cake when you want it. What I try to do is keep things away from home," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavda-Sitaram applies moisturizer, vitamin C serum, and retinol daily, but said that unless you're leading a healthy lifestyle too, topical products aren't going to give you the glow you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

Healthy control samples were sourced from patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery (uninvolved tissue) or stoma reversal. Patient metadata are summarized in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09744-y#MOESM4"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archived diagnostic formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks for ST and validation were obtained from Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust via the Oxford Radciffe Biobank (ORB; REC:19/SC/0173) and the Oxford Centre for Histopathology Research. Additional FFPE blocks were obtained from the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg (ethics: 23–131 bp).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Sample collection, handling and processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-thickness resection tissue samples, surplus to clinical needs, were obtained by the operating surgeon, who identified involved and uninvolved tissue macroscopically. Pathology was confirmed through clinical histopathology reports. Samples were stored in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma-Aldrich), 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin, and 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and transported to the laboratory on ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tissue samples were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Gibco) and examined for anatomical landmarks. Blunt dissection was performed on ice to isolate full-thickness (FT), submucosa (SM) and mucosa (MUC) layers. Following dissection, samples were immediately preserved in CryoStor CS10 (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent digestion following the manufacturer’s protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For FFPE sections, tissues were oriented in cassettes, fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde (VWR International) for 48 h, and transferred to 70% ethanol before being processed through a graded alcohol series for paraffin embedding. FFPE blocks were stored at −20 °C for long-term use until required for histological staining, immunohistochemistry or ST experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Cell isolation, staining and sorting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full thickness tissue samples were dissociated into single-cell suspensions for scRNA-seq using optimized protocols for epithelial and lamina propria (LP) fractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec16"&gt;Epithelial cell enrichment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epithelial cell dissociation was performed by adapting previously described protocols&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Parikh, K. et al.

In brief, cryopreserved FT or MUC tissue samples were thawed for a minute in a 37 °C water bath then washed in 15 ml of supplemented DMEM before centrifugation. Tissue samples were cut into small fragments followed by further centrifugation. Samples were incubated in pre-warmed chelation medium (HBSS (Lonza) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin, HEPES, FCS, 5 mM EDTA (Invitrogen) and 2 mM dithiothreitol (Thermo Fisher)) for 20 min, vortexed periodically, and then centrifuged to isolate crypt-containing supernatants. The chelation protocol was completed a total of two times to increase yield of isolated crypts. Recovered crypts were digested with TrypLE Express (Gibco) and DNase (Sigma) for 30 min to achieve a single-cell suspension, filtered through 70-µm and 40-µm filters to remove debris, and counted for viability. Between 0.5 and 1 million highly viable cells per sample were taken forward for cell staining. Cells were incubated with TruStain FcX (BioLegend) for 10 min at 4 °C, to block non-specific binding. Cells were then stained with a cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) antibody mix (CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD45RA, PD1, CD103, CD56 and CD3, each at 1:100) (BioLegend), to identify and exclude any contaminating immune subsets or intra-epithelial lymphocytes and also stained with hashtag-oligo (HTO) antibodies at 0.75 µl per 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells per 100 µl staining volume (BioLegend), for 30 min at 4 °C. After staining, cells were immediately spun down, and resuspended at the desired pooling concentrations prior to loading on the 10X Chromium platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Immune (CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and stromal (CD45&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;EPCAM&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) cell enrichment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;LP fractions were isolated using an optimized Miltenyi Biotech LP Dissociation Kit protocol tailored for FT ileal tissue. Cryopreserved samples were rapidly thawed and dissected into small fragments and resuspended in buffer L (DMEM (high glucose), FCS and HEPES). Tissue fragments underwent digestion at 37 °C for 2 h, with periodic mechanical dissociation using a blunt needle and syringe. Following digestion, single-cell suspensions were filtered through a 100-µm filter, washed with DMEM followed by centrifugation and counted to ensure high viability prior to further processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For staining and sorting, single-cell suspensions were incubated with antibody panels targeting markers to identify immune (CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (1:100)) and stromal (CD45&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; EPCAM&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (1:50)) populations following TruStain FcX (BioLegend) blockage. TruStain FcX was added at 5 µl per 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells in 100 µl staining volume. Additional CITE-seq and hashtag antibodies were used, as above, to enable multiplexing for scRNA-seq. DAPI stain (1:1,000) just prior to FACS sorting for live-dead differentiation. Flow cytometry (BD LSR II) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BD FACSAria III and BD FACSAria Fusion (BD FACS Diva Software), BD Biosciences) were employed to enrich cell populations. The accuracy of sorting gates was confirmed using compensation controls generated using single colour controls and fluorescence minus one samples. Live cells sorted into stromal (CD45&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;EPCAM&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and immune (CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) subsets were collected in Eppendorfs containing FCS and immediately spun down, counted, resuspended and pooled prior to loading onto the 10X Chromium platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;LeviCell-based stromal cell enrichment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LeviCell platform (LevitasBio) offered an alternative method for stromal enrichment. In brief, FT tissue samples underwent both epithelial crypt chelation and LP digestion. LP-derived single-cell suspensions were then stained with respective hashtag-oligo antibodies, counted and pooled in desired one-to-one ratio. Levitation buffer and CD45 depletion beads were added to the stained LP-derived single-cell suspensions per the manufacturer’s instructions (1004001). The suspension was loaded into the LeviCell-1.0 system, which employs paramagnetic levitation to separate cells based on viability. Live stromal cells (crypt-depleted (CD45&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)) were enriched from the top output well, and dead and CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were removed via the bottom output well. The isolated stromal fraction was directly processed for scRNA-seq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Droplet-based scRNA-seq&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Droplet-based scRNA-seq was undertaken using the 10X Chromium Single Cell platform in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (10X Genomics, 5’ v1.1 chemistry, CG000208, Rev F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 30,000–40,000 cells were loaded per pool. The workflow involved encapsulating individual cells within gel beads in emulsion (GEMs), barcoding, reverse transcription of complementary DNA (cDNA) within GEMs, cDNA clean-up, amplification, and library construction for gene expression (GEX) and antibody-derived tags (ADT) data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance sequencing quality and depth, the workflow was modified by incorporating Jumpcode CRISPRclean Single Cell RNA Boost Kit (KIT1018 v1.0, Jumpcode Genomics). Post-ligation clean-up of GEX libraries included CRISPR RNA depletion using the Cas9–single guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complex. This step targeted unaligned reads, highly expressed ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, and non-variable genes for depletion. Following this, library construction proceeded in line with the manufacturer’s protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Library quality and integrity were assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer TapeStation to ensure compliance with sequencing requirements. Final libraries were pooled at a 4 nM concentration and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500/550 (High Output v2.5, 150 cycles) or outsourced to a NovaSeq PE150. Sequencing depth and run parameters followed the specifications provided by the manufacturer (CG000208, Rev F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Spatial transcriptomics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five to ten 5-µm scrolls were sectioned from each FFPE tissue block and stored at −80 °C for RNA quality assessment. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy FFPE Kit (73504) following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA Pico Assay (Agilent), which quantified DV200 values. Samples with DV200 values above 50% were considered suitable for ST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All FFPE blocks were stained with H&amp;amp;E to evaluate tissue morphology and pathology representation. Only samples meeting both RNA quality and tissue morphology criteria were selected for spatial gene expression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Visium FFPE protocol&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample preparation workflow for 10X Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression (CG000408 and CG000409 rev. D) was followed, with specific optimizations. FFPE blocks were stored at −20 °C, slide drying time was extended to 48 h at room temperature, and deparaffinization and alcoholic rehydration steps were modified to minimize tissue detachment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the ST experiment, 5-μm sections were placed onto Visium FFPE spatial GEX slides, which feature 4 capture areas (42.25 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; each) containing 5,000 gene expression spots per area. Tissue sections were deparaffinized, stained with H&amp;amp;E (imaged using a Zeiss AxioScan at 10× and 20× magnifications), and de-crosslinked. Tissue digestion, gene-specific probe hybridization and cDNA synthesis were performed directly on the slide, incorporating spatial barcoding, per the Visium protocol (CG000407, rev. D). cDNA quantification via qPCR (KAPA SYBR FAST) informed the number of DNA amplification cycles. Libraries were then constructed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Library quality was verified using the Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent) and concentrations were measured using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher). Libraries were pooled at 4 nM, with sample proportions adjusted based on the ratio of tissue section area to capture area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform (High Output v2.5, 150 cycles) with the following run parameters: read 1 (28 cycles), i7 index (10 cycles), i5 index (10 cycles), and read 2S (50 cycles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Xenium FFPE in situ protocol&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slides for Xenium in situ were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions with modifications. In brief, FFPE tissue blocks were sectioned at 5-μm thickness and placed on Xenium slides with a capture area of 235 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (CG000578, rev. C). After drying, sections were deparaffinized and de-crosslinked (CG000580, rev. C) to facilitate probe hybridization. Custom-designed Xenium probes were hybridized to the tissue overnight, followed by probe ligation and annealing of rolling circle amplification primers. Sequential washing steps were performed to minimize autofluorescence and nuclei were stained with DAPI for imaging (CG000582, rev. E). Imaging was conducted using the automated Xenium Analyzer (CG000584, rev. E) which identified transcript counts through unique optical signatures for each gene. Transcripts with quality scores (Q-score) exceeding 20 were retained for downstream analysis. Cell boundaries were initially defined using DAPI images (see ‘Computational analysis’ for cell segmentation details). Xenium Prime analysis was carried out as above, with the addition of cell boundary staining per the user guide (CG000749, rev. B).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Xenium run, slides underwent H&amp;amp;E staining (CG000613, rev. A) to enable direct alignment of gene expression data with histological information from the same tissue section. H&amp;amp;E slides were imaged at 10× and 20× magnifications using the Zeiss AxioScan Z1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Histopathological characterization and validation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Histopathological analysis and annotation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ST analysis, corresponding digitized H&amp;amp;E images were reviewed. Two gastrointestinal pathologists (M.V. and E.F.) independently examined the slides with limited prior knowledge of patient clinical status. Manual annotations captured cellular details, pathology and tissue architecture. Both pathologists reviewed the same slides, and minimal inter-observer variability was observed, ensuring robust assessments. A comprehensive review of the formal histopathology report, including macro- and microscopic details, supplemented the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;Haematoxylin and eosin staining&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin-embedded tissue sections (5 µm) were placed on Superfrost slides (Avantor) and dried. Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series. Sections were stained with modified Harris haematoxylin (Sigma) and eosin Y solution (Sigma), with staining durations adjusted for optimal colour development. After air-drying, slides were mounted using Leica mounting medium and coverslips. Stained sections were digitized at 10× and 20× magnifications using the Zeiss AxioScan Z1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26"&gt;Immunohistochemistry&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin-embedded tissue sections (5 µm) were mounted on Superfrost slides and pre-heated at 60 °C for 1 h. Slides were deparaffinized in 100% Histoclear and rehydrated through graded ethanol. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed in pH 6 or pH 9 buffer (EnVision FLEX, Dako) using a Decloaking Chamber. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and non-specific binding reduced using 2.5% horse serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slides were incubated with primary antibodies (F3, pH 6 1:250; TWIST1, pH 6 1:800; CD45, pH 6 1:50) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing with Flex Buffer (Dako), slides were treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako) and washed again. Peroxidase activity was visualized using DAB substrate (Dako), and slides were counterstained with haematoxylin for nuclear detection. Following washing, slides were dried and mounted with Leica Mounting Medium. High-resolution images (20× magnification) were captured using the Zeiss AxioScan Z1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27"&gt;Collagen fibre staining and imaging&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;FFPE sections (4 µm) were deparaffinized through a standard xylene and ethanol series to water. They were incubated with Picrosirius Red (HB6179) for 60 min at room temperature. Once excess was blotted off, slides were washed twice in 200 ml 0.5% acetic acid solution for 1 min each, followed by 100% ethanol washes for 4 min each. After dipping in Histoclear, slides were covered with micromount medium and coverslip. Imaging was performed at 40× magnification on a Zeiss Axioscanner (brightfield imaging). Polarized light imaging was performed on an Evident VS200 slide scanner (polarized light illumination), using a 40× 0.95 NA air objective lens, with an iDS VS-264C colour camera. An automated stage was used to tile and stitch images of tissue sections using the VS200 ASW software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28"&gt;Quantitative PCR validation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA from FFPE tissue blocks of fistulating CD patients and controls (CD, non-CD and healthy individuals) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Reverse Transcription Master Mix (1006300, Standard Bio). TaqMan assays (Thermo Fisher) were pre-amplified, diluted, and used for qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fluidigm Flex Six IFC workflow (1006308) was employed for high-throughput amplification and target detection. Samples and assays were loaded into the IFC, followed by thermal cycling on the HX controller using the GE FlexSix Fast v2 protocol. Post-run data analysis was performed with Fluidigm Real-Time PCR software (68000088). GAPDH and HPRT1 served as endogenous controls, and gene expression was calculated using &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; values. All assays were run in duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Primary colonic fibroblast derivation and culture&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary colonic fibroblasts were isolated and expanded from endoscopic biopsies obtained from healthy donors using the Lamina Propria Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec 130-097-410). In brief, biopsies were cut into 1–2 mm fragments and washed in DMEM, high glucose, GlutaMAX Supplement, pyruvate (Gibco #39166-021) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (Gibco #15690-056) and Penicillin/Streptomycin (Sigma P0781). To remove epithelial cells, tissue fragments were incubated 3 times in HBSS (Gibco 14025-050) containing Pen/Strep, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher 15575-038), and 2 mM dithiothreitol (Thermo Fisher P2325) at 37 °C for 5 min each, with vortexing between incubations. This process was repeated 3 times in total (cumulative incubation ~45 min) and the remaining tissue fragments were used for stromal cell isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each digestion, tissue fragments were incubated in enzyme mix prepared according to the Lamina Propria Dissociation Kit instructions at 37 °C for 15 min, repeated 3 times. Between incubations, the tissue was mechanically dissociated using a blunt-end needle to facilitate digestion. The resulting suspension was filtered through a 70-µm cell strainer and centrifuged at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep, and 1× ITS (Gibco 41400-045), and seeded into 6-well plates.

HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin One day prior to transfection, 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells were seeded into T25 flasks. Transfection was performed the following day at 90–99% confluency. For each flask, 3.4 µg of the expression plasmid, 2.6 µg of psPAX2 (Addgene 12260), and 1.7 µg of pMD2.G (Addgene 12259) were transfected using 8.75 µl of Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher L3000015), 7.5 µl of P3000 reagent, and 1.25 ml of Opti-MEM (Gibco 31985070).

Following removal of the culture medium, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher J19943K2) for 30 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma T8787) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, cells were blocked in PBS containing 1% BSA (Cell Signaling Technology 9998) and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min, then incubated at room temperature for 2 h with primary antibodies diluted in the same blocking solution: anti-Collagen VII (Abcam ab198899, 1:100) and anti-α-SMA (Dako M0851, 1:400). Cells were then washed with PBS 3 times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, DAPI (Thermo Fisher D1306), and Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (Thermo Fisher A22287). Cells were washed with PBS and mounted with Surgipath Micromount Mounting Medium (Leica 3801731). Samples were imaged with a Zeiss LSM980 confocal microscope and images were analysed using FIJI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For quantification, approximately five images were acquired per condition to ensure sufficient cell numbers (&amp;gt;150 cells per condition). Maximum-intensity &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-projections were generated for each fluorescence channel (Col7A, α-SMA and phalloidin), followed by thresholding and measurement of total signal intensity across the entire field of view. DAPI staining was used to identify nuclei and count cells using a standard FIJI workflow (contrast enhancement, Gaussian blur, thresholding, watershed segmentation, and particle analysis). Signal intensity for each marker was normalized to cell number, and for each patient, the normalized signal intensity in OSR2- or TWIST1-overexpressing conditions was calculated relative to the corresponding control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;Quantitative PCR&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA was extracted from cultured primary fibroblasts using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN, 73034) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher 4374966).

Subsequently, tissue slides were incubated in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min and washed twice with PBS for 5 min. Antigens were retrieved using the NxGen decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical), wherein slides were heated to 110 °C for 4 min in pH 6 citrate buffer (S1699; Agilent or H-3300-250; Vector Laboratories) at 6.1 PSI then cooled to 100 °C over 16 min, rinsed in deionized water and transferred into a pH 9.0 Tris-EDTA buffer (12.1 g Tris base, 3.7 g EDTA, 1 ldistilled water) cooling from 100 °C to 85 °C over 20 min. Slides were then allowed to cool to room temperature and washed twice in PBS. Tissue sections were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 3% bovine serum albumin (A7906; Merck Life Science) and 10% donkey serum (C06SB; Bio-Rad) in PBS. Afterwards slides were washed twice with PBS, submerged in 1 mg l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of DAPI (D357; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and subsequently again washed twice in PBS. Mounting medium combining 50% glycerol (G5516; Merck Life Science) in PBS was then added to the sections and the slides covered with no. 1 glass coverslips (Leica Microsystems).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iterative imaging, staining and dye deactivation slides were imaged using the Cell DIVE system (GE Research) through iterative rounds of staining with fluorescently labelled antibodies and deactivation of the fluorophores. Initially, entire slides were scanned to select the ROIs, then the selected regions were scanned to acquire the tissue-inherent autofluorescence signal. Subsequently, coverslips were removed by incubation in ice cold PBS and the sections incubated for 2 h at room temperature with three primary antibodies diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin and 10% donkey serum in PBS underneath a polycarbonate coverslip (Grace Bio-Labs). In the initial round primary antibodies were detected using fluorophore-labelled cross-adsorbed secondary antibodies raised in donkey (Thermo Fisher Scientific)—in all subsequent rounds primary antibodies directly conjugated to fluorophores were used. Fluorophores with excitation maxima around 488 nm, 555 nm and 647 nm were used, dependent on the antibody either Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 555 and Alexa Fluor 647 (all Thermo Fisher Scientific) or CF 488 A, CF 555 and CF 647 (all Biotium). The stained slides were then washed twice in PBS, stained with DAPI and re-mounted as above. The selected ROIs per slide were then again scanned on the CellDIVE, and the autofluorescence signal previously acquired was removed from the signal of the staining round. The fluorophores were deactivated by de-coverslipping slides, washing them twice in PBS and incubating them at room temperature 3 times for 15 min in 0.1 M NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at pH 11.2 (S6297; Merck Life Science) with 3% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (216763; Merck Life Science) with intermittent incubation in PBS for 5 min. After dye inactivation, slides were again incubated with DAPI, mounted and scanned as above to acquire the background anew. Subsequently, slides were stained with primary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores and imaged as in the first round. This background-staining-deactivation cycle was repeated until all markers had been acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary antibodies were either purchased conjugated to fluorophores as indicated or conjugated with either the Mix-n-Stain Antibody CF488A/555/647 dye Labelling Kits (92233, 92234 and 92238; Biotium), the Alexa Fluor 488/555/647 Antibody Labelling Kits (A88062, A88065 and A88068; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or with a combination of the oYo-Link Thiol Antibody Reagent (AT3001; AlphaThera) and CF 488A maleimide, CF 555 maleimide and CF 647 maleimide (all Biotium). For the Mix-n-Stain and the Alexa Fluor kit conjugation followed manufacturer instructions, for the AlphaThera oYo-Link thiol kit, per 1 μg of antibody 33 pmol of oYo-Link thiol reagent and 155 pmol of maleimide-fluorophores were used. The oYo-Link thiol reagent was mixed with the maleimide-fluorophores in PBS and incubated at 37 °C on a heat block (Thermomixer comfort; Eppendorf) shaking for 2 h at 600 RPM in the dark. Subsequently, the resulting fluorophore-linked oYo reagent was mixed with the antibody and crosslinked to it for 2 h using 365 nm UV light at 4 °C (LED photo-cross-linking device AT8001-D; AlphaThera). Finally, one part of the conjugated antibody mix was diluted with two parts of PBS-based antibody stabilizer (131 050; Candor Bioscience).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;Computational analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Raw sequencing data processing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All raw sequencing data were converted from BCL to FASTQ format using Illumina bcl2fastq (v.2.20.0.422) software.

The thresholds were determined per cell lineage basis from thresholding the empirical distributions after an initial clustering solution, as for instance epithelial cells typically contain higher percentage of mitochondrial UMIs than other cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following cell QC for each pool, cells were demultiplexed using hashing antibody counts matrices as follows. Non-hashing antibodies and tags absent from any given reaction were filtered out from the counts matrix. Counts matrices were normalized using centred log ratio transformation. Counts were clustered using clara &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mediods (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = number of samples + 1). The 99th percentile of a negative binomial distribution fit was defined as a positive threshold for each antibody tag. Doublets were identified as cells positive for multiple tags and filtered out from further analysis. Given sufficiently large number of samples in each pool, the majority of doublets will be heterotypic due to random mixing and therefore this approach enables robust, experimental label driven doublet removal. Cells which could not be confidently assigned to a sample label were also filtered out from further analysis. Demultiplexed cells were visualized as &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-SNE embeddings and sex-specific gene expression (for example, &lt;i&gt;XIST&lt;/i&gt;) was further examined to ensure the cells were segregated correctly as expected with sample-of-origin assignments and patient meta data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All samples were merged using R package Seurat (v.5.1.0)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 58" title="Hao, Y. et al.

Nuclei-based segmentation from XeniumRanger outputs was integrated as a prior with a weighting factor of 0.7. –n-clusters parameter was set to 12, determined from the initial clustering solution of nuclei-segmented data.

For MERC score, we assessed both universal cell-type markers, as well as scores focused on problem areas in intestinal tissue specifically. These included T cells and B cells, which form dense aggregates in follicles and therefore are difficult to segment and epithelial cells and T cells, where intra-epithelial lymphocytes wedged in between epithelial cells are often segmented as part of the nearby epithelial cells. MERC gene sets used are provided as part of Mendeley Data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec45"&gt;Xenium ST clustering analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell by gene counts matrix following cell re-segmentation was converted into Seurat R object for further analysis. Very small cells, which likely represent segmentation artefacts, and cells with very few detected transcripts (&amp;lt;15 per cell) were filtered out from further analysis. Cells with higher than expected (&amp;gt;99th percentile) negative probe signal were also filtered out from further analysis. As the remaining cells formed a prohibitively large dataset (&amp;gt;7M cells in total), undertook a sketch-based analysis workflow, as implemented in Seurat R package. In brief, for each tissue section, we sampled 5,000 cells using the LeverageScore method to select most informative cells. Data from the sketched subset cells was then dimensionality-reduced using PCA, followed by slide integration using Harmony, as described before. Nearest-neighbour graph was constructed for downstream clustering analysis and clusters were visualized using UMAP embeddings. The remaining cells from the full dataset were then projected onto the sketched data and onto the sketched UMAP model representation using ProjectIntegration and ProjectData functions. All subsequent analyses and statistics were computed on integrated dataset from all slides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low resolution clusters were annotated as broad cell-type lineages based on marker gene expression and label transfer of scRNA-seq reference data onto the sketched dataset. Each broad lineage identified (such as epithelium, fibroblasts or T cells) was then subset and further sub-clustered to identify cell subsets, which were similarly annotated as before. In the case where clusters were identified by our Xenium panel markers that did not have a one-to-one relationship to a scRNA-seq reference cluster and/or our panel did not contain subtype-defining markers, we annotated clusters based on their cell lineage combined with most specific gene marker expression (for example, &lt;i&gt;SPP1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages, &lt;i&gt;NOS2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; epithelium).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec46"&gt;Xenium ST cell niche detection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell niche detection was performed using an unsupervised approach implemented as part of the spamsc R package (&lt;a href="https://github.com/ChloeHJ/spamsc"&gt;https://github.com/ChloeHJ/spamsc&lt;/a&gt;). Initially, for each field of view within the ST dataset, the spatial coordinates of cell centroids were extracted to determine the nearest neighbours for each cell, with the number of neighbours set to 30. Utilizing these coordinates, two separate neighbour matrices were constructed for each cell: (1) expression counts of each cell’s nearest neighbours were aggregated, generating a cell-by-gene matrix that encapsulates the local transcriptomic environment; and (2) cell types, as defined by high-resolution cell subclusters from previous analyses, in each cell neighbourhood were counted and aggregated into a cell-by-cell-type matrix that encapsulates the local cell-type neighbours for each cell. This process was iteratively applied across all slides and the matrices were merged. To identify tissue niches, unsupervised clustering of the neighbourhood matrices was used by first carrying out PCA (for gene expression matrices only), integrating the principal components using Harmony across different slides and detecting niche clusters using Louvain clustering. Niches were labelled according to their location, tissue architecture features or cell-type enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec47"&gt;Xenium ST cell co-localization analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For cell–cell co-localization analysis in Xenium ST dataset, the following approach was taken. First, using spatial coordinates of each cell centroid, nearest 30 spatial neighbours for each cell were determined and cell-type counts in each spatial cellular neighbourhood were aggregated. We then constructed a cell-type correlation matrix between each cell and its neighbours, representing the frequency of co-occurrence between different cell types. A separate co-occurrence matrix was constructed for each different experimental group. Cell-type co-occurrence networks were visualized as graphs, where edges of low co-occurrence (&amp;lt;0.15), as well as negative co-occurrence (that is, cells always localize away from each other—for example, muscle cells and epithelium) were filtered out. Graphs were laid out using force-directed layout and visualized using ggpraph R package (v.2.2.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec48"&gt;Xenium ST custom panel design&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A custom 480-gene panel was designed for Xenium ST to delineate over 100 fine-grained cell types within the gut, as defined by previously published single-cell reference datasets and scRNA-seq data generated as part of this study. Additional genes from literature were included to cover cell types that are typically difficult to capture using droplet-based scRNA-seq approaches—for example, neurons and neutrophils, as well as squamous epithelium markers, a cell type that is typically not present in the intestine. Genes were expert-selected to ensure comprehensive representation across stromal, immune, and epithelial lineages while excluding highly abundant transcripts to prevent optical crowding. For each identified cell type, 5 to 10 redundant genes were incorporated to ensure cell typing robustness. The panel’s performance was iteratively evaluated by assessing its ability to reconstruct scRNA-seq clustering patterns in the reference datasets. Probe balance was further optimized using 10X online Xenium Panel Designer tool. Xenium Prime 100 gene custom add-on panel was designed using the same procedure, focusing on key missing intestinal marker genes and disease-specific markers. All custom panel designs have been provided as part of Mendeley Data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec49"&gt;scRNA-seq meta-analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For scRNA-seq meta-analysis, data were downloaded from GEO, ENA or Zenodo repositories (see Data availability). Individual datasets were initially clustered to replicate analyses from their respective studies and fibroblast clusters from each study were subset for further downstream analyses. Fibroblast cells from public datasets and this study were then merged and integrated using harmony, correcting for both between dataset differences and known within-dataset batch variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify transcriptional programmes across transcriptomic data, cNMF&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 70" title="Kotliar, D. et al.

Resulting gene loadings and usage scores were used for downstream interpretation and spatial mapping of inferred programmes. To visualize the relative contribution of cNMF-derived gene expression programmes (GEPs) across cell states, we calculated per-cluster usage proportions. First, harmony-corrected cNMF usage scores (that is, per cell factor loadings) were integrated into the Seurat metadata. For each annotated cell cluster, average usage scores were computed per factor. GEPs with low average usage (&amp;lt;0.05) were excluded to reduce noise. Remaining average scores were normalized within each cluster to sum to one, yielding relative proportions per GEP. These proportions were visualized as pie charts, with all non-disease cluster associated GEPS collapsed into an ‘other’ category for ease of visualization. All visualizations were generated using ggplot2 with coord_polar() for circular layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cNMF factors derived from meta-analysis were then applied to Xenium in situ 5100-plex dataset, calculating activity scores for each cell in the spatial dataset. Furthermore, cells from a diabetic wound-healing dataset&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 37" title="Theocharidis, G. et al.

Separately, cNMF factors were similarly calculated for fibroblast cells from Xenium in situ 5100-plex dataset, and reciprocally applied to the scRNA-seq meta-analysis to cross-map gene expression programmes identified with these different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec50"&gt;Xenium spatial autocorrelation analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify gene pairs with spatially correlated expression patterns, we used two approaches. Firstly, local spatial neighbourhood gene expression matrices were computed as described in ‘Niche analysis’ and gene–gene Pearson’s correlation was calculated to detect co-localization gene expression patterns regardless of cell type. Additionally, for each gene pair, we also calculated a bivariate Moran’s &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; statistic, which quantifies how the spatial distribution of each gene related to that of another. Statistical significance was assessed by permutation testing, in which the spatial positions were repeatedly randomized to generate a null distribution of Moran’s &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; values. The resulting &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted for multiple testing, and significant positive or negative bivariate Moran’s &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; values indicated spatially co-expressed or contrasting gene pairs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec51"&gt;scRNA-seq spatial projection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial projection of fibroblast scRNA-seq data was carried out using the spamsc R package workflow (&lt;a href="https://github.com/ChloeHJ/spamsc"&gt;https://github.com/ChloeHJ/spamsc&lt;/a&gt;). In brief, to project single-cell fibroblast data onto a Xenium spatial dataset, we first identified genes shared between the scRNA-seq fibroblast dataset and the Xenium data, removing any features not expressed in either dataset. After merging these filtered datasets into a single Seurat object, we normalized and scaled them, then applied Harmony to batch correct for differences between the single-cell and spatial modalities. We extracted a reduced dimensional embedding and used a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; nearest-neighbour approach to map fibroblast single cells onto the Xenium slide. For each fibroblast cell in the single-cell dataset, we searched for neighbouring Xenium spatial cells in the integrated reduced space; if spatial fibroblast cells were among the top neighbours, the spatial coordinates of the closest such neighbour were assigned to that cell. The accuracy of this mapping was assessed by comparing gene expression patterns between projected fibroblasts and the local spatial environment, using correlation analyses and evaluating enrichment of known fibroblast markers. These methods were applied using SPAMsc functions MergeDatasets and RunProjection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec52"&gt;Xenium cell adjacency-dependent gene expression analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess how a given cell type’s gene expression patterns differ depending on the identity of its neighbouring cells, we implemented a procedure that aggregates gene expression counts based on spatial adjacency. First, we extracted cell centroid &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinates for each tissue section. For each section, a nearest-neighbour graph was constructed using Euclidean distances between cell centroids, and for each cell, the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; nearest neighbours were identified. We then focused on a particular cell type or group of cell types—for example, only epithelial cells, or FAS cells. Cells not belonging to the target identity group were excluded by zeroing out their counts. The expression values of the selected gene set (from a specified spatial assay) for the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; nearest neighbours of each cell were then summed, yielding a ‘niche expression matrix’ that represents the aggregated gene expression within local neighbourhoods populated by the specified cell types. By applying this process across multiple images and combining the results, we obtained a matrix that captures how gene expression in a cell of interest changes when it is surrounded by different cell populations. The aggregated niche expression matrix was then filtered to remove cells which do not have any cells of the selected cell type in their local neighbourhood. Gene expression counts of the remaining cells were then normalized and subjected to downstream differential expression analyses to quantify gene expression differences conditioned on spatial adjacency to particular cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec53"&gt;Distance gradient-based analyses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fistula edge gradient-based analyses, fistula were selected where the tract was clearly delineated, with samples excluded where the edge of the tract was not fully captured. Fistula tract edges were then manually annotated using interactive XeniumExplorer software and coordinates of the polygonal annotations were exported as csv files. These were imported and converted into sf polygon objects. Then for each tissue section, centroid coordinates of tissue-detected cells were extracted, converted into spatial features, and distances to the nearest polygon edge were computed using st_distance() from the sf package. These distances were added to the Seurat metadata and visualized using ImageFeaturePlot().&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For downstream analysis, cells were grouped by cell type and donor (slide ID), and kernel density estimates of cell abundance as a function of distance were computed independently per donor using the density() function in R. To summarize across donors, mean densities were calculated at each distance point, and standard errors were estimated as the standard deviation of densities across donors divided by the square root of the number of samples per group. These were visualized as mean ± standard error using geom_line() and geom_ribbon(). To identify genes with expression patterns that vary as a function of distance from fistula edges, we modelled gene expression counts using negative binomial generalized additive models with distance as a smooth spline term. For each gene, significance of the distance effect was assessed by comparing the full spline model to a null model using likelihood ratio test. These tests were carried out within lineage—that is, distance varying genes were identified in fibroblasts and macrophages separately by subsetting these cells individually. Genes with significant spatial associations were visualized using heat maps, plotting loess-smoothed gene expression over distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epithelial-edge distance-based analyses were carried out as above, except starting from manually annotated epithelial edges and excluding all non-epithelial cells from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec54"&gt;Picrosirius red image analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual images were first processed in Qupath software (v.0.5.0). In brief, tissue-covered areas of each slide slides were first selected as ROIs, with areas containing imaging or tissue artefacts filtered out. A groovy script was then used to systematically partition and export image tiles of defined size (512 × 512 pixels) with partial overlap (64 pixels), with &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinates for each image tile exported along the image for downstream processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All subsequent image analyses were then performed in Python (v.3.9). All analyses were conducted using skimage for image processing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 71" title="van der Walt, S. et al. scikit-image: image processing in Python.

For each image, the red colour channel was extracted, pixel intensities were normalized to 0–1 range and uniform global thresholds of 0.15 and 0.18 for all images were set for red channel binarization, after initial exploratory analyses with Otsu’s thresholding to guide parameter settings. The red channel image was then binarized at the two thresholds for parallel analyses, with the higher threshold excluding less well stained, sparser collagen bundles. Following binarization, we undertook morphological pre-processing of each image tile with erosion and opening using skimage.morphology operations to remove small specs of noise and smooth the collagen structures. Following pre-processing, each binarized tile was skeletonized using skimage.morphology.skeletonize, producing one-pixel-wide paths representing the collagen bundle backbone structures. Small, spurious branches were pruned. The resulting skeleton was used to compute several morphological and structural metrics as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="u-list-style-none"&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                      &lt;p&gt;Length and thickness: connected components in the skeleton were first identified using skimage.measure.label and their perimeter approximations were used as a proxy for collagen length distribution. This yielded total length, mean length and selected quantiles (5th, 50th and 95th) as features for each tile. Thickness was estimated by calculating Euclidean distance transform with scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt on the binary mask and extracting the distance values along the collagen skeleton. Total, mean and quantile values for each image patch were calculated as features.&lt;/p&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                      &lt;p&gt;Connectivity and morphological descriptors: the number of connected components within the skeleton was used to calculate collagen network connectivity in each image tile. We also calculated perimeter-area ratio, eccentricity (shape elongation) and average elongation (major/minor axis ratio of fitted ellipses) using skimage.measure.regionprops.&lt;/p&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/li&gt;

                      &lt;p&gt;Fractal and textural measures: fractal dimension was estimated using a box-counting method across multiple scales. Lacunarity, a measure of textural heterogeneity, or ‘gappyness’, was computed at four different box sizes for each image patch. Additionally, Shannon entropy, which can provide a measure of image complexity, was calculated using skimage.measure.shannon_entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/li&gt;

                      &lt;p&gt;Anisotropy and orientation: anisotropy was calculated from the image patch skeletons by calculating the variance in the orientations of the skeleton segments. Anisotropy measures the overall directional coherence of the network; that is, how parallel each segment is to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

                      &lt;p&gt;Mean free path and collagen fraction: a mean free path along both collagen regions and regions between collagen areas was estimated by computing pairwise distances between feature points. To compute the total collagen fraction, the proportion of thresholded pixels at both thresholds used was calculated for each image path.&lt;/p&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;All metrics were mapped to &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; spatial coordinates of the image patches for further spatial analysis and visualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For image clustering analysis, a variational autoencoder was trained on exported image tiles, integrated with a pretrained VGG16 encoder as a feature extraction backbone. In brief, a custom image tile generator class was implemented to load and preprocess image tiles to resize, normalize intensities and apply gamma correction. The generator also computed Shannon entropy for each tile to determine sample weights to reduce the weights of any texturally uninformative tiles (for example, edge tiles) during training. For VAE architecture, the encoder consistent of an initially frozen VGG16 network pretrained on ImageNet to extract robust feature representations, followed by a fully connected layer and two dense layers producing the latent parameters with a latent dimensionality of 64. A sampling layer generated latent vectors from these parameters. The decoder employed a series of transposed convolutional and up sampling layers to reconstruct the original image resolution from the latent space. The entire model was compiled with a mean-squared-error loss and trained until convergence on total of 301,941 image tiles. 64 dimension latent vector was then extracted for each image tile and used as input for Louvain clustering (resolution – 0.3). Clusters were intersected with morphological and structural tile metrics calculated as described above, and annotated on the basis of average collagen density per cluster, with highly fibrotic tissue regions annotated as ‘very high’ clusters and tissue regions with lower levels of collagen deposition (such as mucosa) as ‘low’ or ‘mid’ regions. Comparative analysis of relative cluster abundance between fistulae and control samples were carried out using sccomp R package, as described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec55"&gt;Fibroblast lineage prediction analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;pySCENIC was used to reconstruct transcription factor regulons for fibroblast cell subsets specifically and cell-by-AUC matrices for each transcription factor were imported into R for further processing. Transcription factor activity scores were scaled and used as input for dimensionality reduction by PCA. Fibroblasts cells from healthy control samples were grouped into broad fibroblast subtypes -Stromal 1–4 subsets and served as a reference dataset, while all other cells, including fistula-associated fibroblasts, were then classified with respect to the reference using Seurat’s label-transfer workflow (FindTransferAnchors and TransferData). For each query cell, a prediction probability was calculated on the basis of transcription factor regulon activity score embeddings, scoring the cell as most similar to each of the four main fibroblast subtypes, Stromal 1–4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec56"&gt;Pathway enrichment analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene Ontology (GO) and Reactome pathway enrichment analyses for both scRNA-seq and ST data were conducted using the clusterProfiler R package&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 73" title="Yu, G., Wang, L.

Gene identifiers were mapped with the org.Hs.eg.db (v.3.19.1) annotation DBI package (v.1.66.0). Individual cluster marker sets and differentially expressed genes were analysed for overrepresentation, using all expressed or detected genes as the background reference. Hypergeometric &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted for multiple testing through the Benjamini–Hochberg method. The enrichment results were visualized with clusterProfiler and ggplot2 packages.

The spot matrix was filtered to retain only spots that overlapped with tissue. To assess background signal, we fitted a negative binomial distribution to the total UMI counts of spots located outside tissue sections. Using this distribution as a reference, we further removed any tissue-overlapping spots whose UMI counts were indistinguishable from the non-tissue background, as these likely represented areas of under-permeabilization. Most spots removed via this procedure were either section-specific anomalies or associated with tissue artefacts. Additional tissue irregularities (e.g., folds, tears) were annotated based on H&amp;amp;E images, and the corresponding spots were also excluded from the downstream analysis manually. Spots under coverslip air bubbles, however, were retained, as these defects affected only the H&amp;amp;E image and not the underlying tissue integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, raw UMI counts were normalized using SCTransform, a regularized negative binomial regression-based method&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 74" title="Hafemeister, C. &amp;amp; Satija, R.

Subsequent clustering analysis was performed using the Louvain algorithm at a resolution of 0.5, and results were visualized using UMAP. Clusters were visualized on H&amp;amp;E images with a spot size scaling factor of 1.6. The resulting integrated clusters were compared to those derived from individual slides to confirm that no biologically relevant heterogeneity was lost after batch correction. In addition, we ensured that corresponding tissue regions across slides converged into the same integrated clusters, confirming successful alignment of equivalent anatomical areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec58"&gt;Visium ST cell-type deconvolution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visium ST cell-type deconvolution was carried out using R package CARD&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 75" title="Ma, Y. &amp;amp; Zhou, X.

Each ST spot was scored for receptor–ligand co-expression by incorporating weighted expression from neighbouring spots. We calculated pairwise Euclidean distances for all ST spots and assigned distance-based weights, setting weights to zero for spots beyond two neighbours and normalizing weights for closer spots. For each spot, we computed a distance-weighted receptor–ligand product score, scaled by the number of contributing spots to account for tissue edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine significance, we performed 100 random permutations of spot locations to generate an empirical background distribution and calculated &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values for each receptor–ligand pair based on this distribution. After applying Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple testing, spots with FDR &amp;lt; 5% were considered positive for receptor–ligand cross-talk. We then prioritized region-specific interactions using generalized linear modelling, assessing the dependence of receptor–ligand scores on spatial clusters while controlling for gene detection rates. Condition-specific interactions were similarly modelled, and all significant receptor–ligand pairs were further subject to multiple testing correction to ensure robust identification of region- and condition-specific cellular communication events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec60"&gt;Bulk RNA-seq analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw sequence reads were quality checked using FastQC software&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 55" title="Andrews, S.

In brief, approximately 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; to 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells were lysed with 1 ml cold mitochondrial lysis buffer and the cytosolic and mitochondria fractions were then isolated as described above. The cytosolic fraction was quenched by 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in water (the final concentration of trichloroacetic acid is 10%) and the mitochondria fraction was resuspended in 1 ml 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The mitochondria fraction was placed into liquid N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for 5 min and thawed on ice for 5 min and the freeze–thaw cycle was repeated four times followed by centrifugation (17,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 4 °C, 10 min). The mitochondria supernatants and cytosolic fractions were then purified using Oasis HLB 1cc (30 mg) SPE columns (Waters). Columns were washed with methanol, equilibrated with water, loaded with the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, washed with water and eluted with elution buffer (25 mM ammonium acetate in methanol). The elutions were evaporated by freeze-vacuum, resuspended in 20 μl 20% acetonitrile in water and analysed by LC–MS. For in vivo AcCoA measurement, tissues were obtained from C57BL/6J mice, and 50–100 mg tissue was collected in 1 ml precooled 10% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were then homogenized and lysed on a rotating shaker (30 min, 4 °C) followed by centrifugation (12,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was purified, dried and resuspended as described above, and analysed using LC–MS. Then, 5 µl of each sample was injected and analysed using SHIMADZU LC-30AB LC system coupled to the QTRAP7500 Mass Spectrometer (SCIEX). Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) with the BEH column (1.7 µm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm; Waters) was used. Mobile phase A was as follows: ammonia with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.2% ammonia. Mobile phase B was acetonitrile. The flow rate was 0.2 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and the column temperature was set at 40 °C. Linear gradient: 0 min, 80% B; 3 min, 50% B; 10 min, 50% B; 10.1 min, 80% B; 15 min, 80% B. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) technology using MS/MS was used for specific detection of AcCoA. The LC–MS system was operated in negative ionization mode. The source parameters included curtain gas (CUR) at 40 psi; collision active dissociation (CAD) gas at 6; ion source gas 1 (GS1) at 40 psi, GS2 at 70 psi; ion spray voltage (IS) at 4,500 V; ion source temperature (TEM) at 450 °C. The specific transition was recorded as follows: AcCoA 808.0945 &amp;gt; 407.9000. The final AcCoA level was normalized to the actin immunoblot level, or the tissue weight or cell number, as described in the figure legends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For serum amino acid measurement (proline, glutamate acid, serine, asparagine, glutamine, arginine, glycine, alanine, aspartic acid, tyrosine, histidine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine and tryptophan, while cysteine was too low to be detected), blood was collected from eyes and clotted at room temperature for 1 h followed by centrifugation (3,000 rpm,10 min). Then, 20 μl serum was diluted with 80 μl precooled methanol and vortexed, then centrifuged at 12,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 15 min to remove proteins. The supernatants were evaporated by freeze-vacuum, resuspended in 100 μl 80% methanol in water and analysed by LC–MS. Then, 1 µl of each sample was injected and analysed using UPLC-H Class LC system (Waters) coupled to the 6500 QTRAP Mass Spectrograph (SCIES). The ultimate AQ-C18 column (5 µm, 2.1 mm × 250 mm; Welch) was used at room temperature. Mobile phase A was as follows: water (0.1% formic acid, v/v); and mobile phase B was acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid, v/v). Linear gradient: 0–1 min, 0% B; 1–14 min, 0–90% B; 14–16 min, 90% B; 16–16.1 min, 90–0% B; 16.1–20 min, 0% B. The flow rate was 0.2 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. MRM technology using MS/MS was used for specific detection of various amino acids. The LC–MS system was operated in positive ionization mode. The source parameters included CUR at 40 psi; CAD at medium; GS1 at 40 psi, GS2 at 40 psi; IS at 5,500 V; and TEM at 500 °C. All LC–MS analysis was performed by the Metabolic Platform at the Fudan University.

In brief, 0.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cells were seeded onto an XFe96 cell culture microplate (Agilent) per well and treated with CCCP (10 μM), SB (100 μM), BTC (5 mM), HC (20 mM) and SM for 16 h. Before analysis, cells were washed twice and equilibrated with XF DMEM in a 37 °C incubator without CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for 1 h. Oligomycin (final concentration: 1.5 μM), FCCP (final concentration: 2 μM), and rotenone/antimycin A (final concentration: 0.5 μM) were used in OCR analysis.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Keck Medicine of USC have identified another potential cause of liver damage. A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Liver International&lt;/em&gt; links tetrachloroethylene (PCE), a chemical widely used in dry cleaning and found in household products like adhesive glues, spot removers, and stainless steel polish, to serious liver harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the findings, exposure to PCE can triple the risk of significant liver fibrosis, a condition where scar tissue builds up in the liver. Over time, this scarring can progress to liver cancer, liver failure, or even death. The study also revealed a clear dose-response relationship: the greater the exposure to PCE, the higher the likelihood of developing liver fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study, the first to examine the association between PCE levels in humans and significant liver fibrosis, underscores the underreported role environmental factors may play in liver health," said Brian P. Lee, MD, MAS, a hepatologist and liver transplant specialist with Keck Medicine and lead author of the study. "The findings suggest that exposure to PCE may be the reason why one person develops liver disease while someone with the exact same health and demographic profile does not."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyday Exposure to PCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCE is a man-made, colorless liquid widely used to remove grease in industrial and household settings, including dry cleaning. People are often exposed to the chemical through the air when it slowly evaporates from recently dry-cleaned clothes. It can also enter drinking water when spills or improper disposal contaminate soil and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies PCE as a probable carcinogen. Previous studies have connected it to bladder cancer, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Dr. Lee noted that other research has also linked PCE exposure to liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these health concerns, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has initiated a 10-year phaseout of PCE in dry cleaning and placed restrictions on its use in other industries. Still, the chemical persists in certain products and remains unregulated in some countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Findings: Greater Exposure, Greater Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee and his colleagues analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a large, nationally representative study of U.S. adults. They examined blood samples from participants aged 20 and older collected between 2017 and 2020 and found that about 7% of people had detectable levels of PCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with measurable PCE exposure were three times more likely to have significant liver fibrosis compared to those without exposure, regardless of age, sex, race, or education level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, higher-income individuals appeared more likely to have detectable PCE in their blood, possibly due to greater use of dry-cleaning services. However, workers in dry-cleaning facilities may face the highest risk because of long-term, direct contact with the chemical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every one nanogram per milliliter increase in PCE in the bloodstream (a nanogram equals one-billionth of a gram), the likelihood of significant liver fibrosis rose fivefold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Hidden Explanation for Unexplained Liver Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that traditional risk factors like alcohol consumption and fat accumulation in the liver did not appear to influence fibrosis when PCE was present. "Patients will ask, how can I have liver disease if I don't drink and I don't have any of the health conditions typically associated with liver disease, and the answer may be PCE exposure," said Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee emphasized that PCE may be just one of several environmental toxins contributing to liver disease. "No doubt there are other toxins in our environment besides PCE that are dangerous to the liver," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also hopes the findings will lead to earlier detection and better outcomes for those affected. "We hope our research will help both the public and physicians understand the connection between PCE exposure and significant liver fibrosis," Lee said. "If more people with PCE exposure are screened for liver fibrosis, the disease can be caught earlier and patients may have a better chance of recovering their liver function," said Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

We interpret these results to suggest that, despite uneven sequence acquisition across time, the diversity of sampled sequences roughly reflect the amplitude of H5N1 cases. Given these results, we opted to use sequencing data for the entire sampling period for broad inferences on introductions and geographical spread, but supplement these analyses with controls for sampling differences between groups. For more-intensive reconstructions of transmission patterns between wild birds, commercial poultry and backyard birds, we focus on the initial 6-month period with the most densely sampled data, coupled with experiments to assess the impacts of sampling on results. Finally, although we retained data from Canada and Central America for all subsequent analyses, our results are probably most informative about transmission within the USA due to the heavy skewing of data towards the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec14"&gt;AVONET database&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We downloaded the AVONET database for avian ecology data and merged it to available host metadata from GISAID for each sequence&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 74" title="Tobias, J.

When reporting these results, we refer to state A as the source population/state and B as the sink population/state. We implemented the BSSVS, which enables us to determine which rates have the highest posterior support by using a stochastic binary operator which turns on and off rates to determine their contribution to the diffusion network. In addition to the discrete trait diffusion rate, we used a Markov Jump analysis to observe the number of jumps between discrete states across the posterior set of trees and estimated the Markov rewards to determine the waiting time for a given discrete trait state in the phylogeny&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Minin, V.

The Markov reward proportion is calculated as the proportion of the phylogeny at a given time being a given discrete state. By looking at the proportion of a given state over time across the phylogeny, we can provide a proxy for how long transmission has occurred in each group between transition events. We calculate the transition rate as a realization of the CTMC process by dividing the number of Markov jumps by the tree height (branch length from the earliest tip to the root of the tree), and separately, by tree length (sum of all branch lengths). For each pairwise transition rate, we calculate the level of BF support that the given rate has. The BF represents the support of a given rate, and is calculated as the ratio of the posterior odds of the given rate being non-zero divided by the equivalent prior odds, which is set as a Poisson prior with a 50% prior probability on the minimal number of rates possible&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 79" title="Lemey, P., Rambaut, A., Drummond, A.

To account for differential sampling among these host order groups, we considered two distinct subsampling approaches. The first is a proportional sampling regime in which sequences are sampled proportional to the detections in each host group each month. This common sampling regime assumes that case detections in each group are the closest proxy for the case distribution in the outbreak, and attempts to align sampling with underlying model assumptions. However, this approach may not be appropriate if case detection is heavily biased between groups. For HPAI H5N1 in North America, detections in wild birds are primarily identified when humans report sick or dead birds to wildlife health authorities or wildlife rescues (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;), which may skew detections towards birds with dedicated rescue services or birds that reside in closer proximity to humans. For example, Anseriformes and raptors comprised 50.2% and 20.3% of all sequences, respectively, which could arise from high case intensity or a higher rate of case acquisition. A second, complementary subsampling approach is to sample sequences equally, meaning that sequences are sampled from each group in perfectly equal numbers. By forcing the number of sequences from each group to be equal, the transmission inference must be driven by the underlying sequence diversity in each group rather than by sampling differences. Given the high variation among detections within each host group, we opted to pursue both sampling regimes and focus on results that were concordant in both. We first performed an AI test to confirm that clustering was sufficient for discrete trait inference (Extended Data Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#Tab1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). Next, for each regime, we performed three independent subsamples, where the dataset was sampled either proportional to cases or equally. For the equal sampling regime, each dataset included 100 randomly sampled sequences per host group, except for Passeriformes, for which only 57 sequences were available. To account for variation across subsampled datasets, we combined the results for the three independent subsamples to summarize statistical support (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). Owing to similar tree topologies across replicates, we visualized the phylogeny of the dataset with the highest posterior support (equal order subsample 1) in the main text and make the results of all analyses available in supplement (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#MOESM1"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;). Finally, to measure the effects of potential sampling bias on the inferred transition rates, we performed a modified tip-shuffle analysis. We generated 100 datasets in which the host tip assignments were randomly shuffled, re-inferred the host group at internal nodes and infer a mean root state probability for each host across the 100 shuffled datasets. We then compared the root state probability in the empirical data to that inferred in the shuffled data as a measure of the impact of sampling on the results as previously described (see the ‘Tip-shuffle analysis’ section for further details)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 38" title="Edwards, C.

We repeated this random subsampling three times, resulting in three separate datasets. For the proportional sampling regime, we performed three subsamples of sequences based on the proportion of detections in each host order group, which were collected between 4 November 2021 and 11 August 2023. Three random proportional samples were taken each with the following number of sequences for each group: Accipitriformes (133), Anseriformes (342), Passeriformes (12), non-human-mammal (16), Galliformes (83), Charadriiformes (40), Strigiformes (29) (total &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 655 sequences).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec23"&gt;Migratory behaviour analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We defined discrete traits for use in discrete trait diffusion modelling based on the available sequence metadata and merged AVONET data. In addition to taxonomic order, we defined migratory behaviour. Birds were classified as sedentary (staying in each location and not showing any major migration behaviour), partially migratory (for example, small proportion of population migrates long distances, or population undergoes short-distance migration, nomadic movements, distinct altitudinal migration) or migratory (the majority of population undertakes long-distance migration). We subsampled sequences based on migratory behaviour including non-human-mammals and domestic birds to create a subsample of 500 sequences with equal sampling across behaviour groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Rationale for inclusion of turkeys as domestic birds&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While commercial turkey operations represent 53.7% of all detections on commercial farms&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Patyk, K.

However, epidemiological data suggest that most deposited turkey sequences probably stem from domestic outbreaks. Among case detections during the study period, only 139 were reported in wild turkeys, representing 1.5% of all wild bird detections. By contrast, commercial turkey outbreaks comprised 28.5% of all domestic detections in the study period, suggesting that unlabelled turkey sequences are most likely to have come from domestic birds. While these data are not conclusive, we opted to perform an additional analysis to determine whether our exclusion of turkey sequences (that are most likely domestic) may have biased our results. In the analyses detailed below, turkeys are assumed to be domestic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;Domestic/wild titration analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the impact of sampling of wild birds on the estimation of rates between domestic and wild birds, we created five separate datasets with varying numbers of wild birds for sequences collected between 2021 and 2023. We randomly sampled 270 domestic sequences and 270 wild sequences as the initial 1:1 ratio dataset. We then made four more datasets increasing the number of wild sequences by a factor of 0.5 (adding 135 wild sequences), resulting in a final titration of 1:3 domestic to wild sequences (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1,080). We applied a two-state asymmetric CTMC discrete trait diffusion model in which sequences were labelled as domestic or wild. All priors and model parameters selected are the same as those described in the empirical tree set description above. To study the impact of the inclusion of turkeys in the transmission between domestic and wild populations, we annotated all unannotated sequences collected from turkeys as domestic (see the rationale in section above). We then created three datasets starting with 525 domestic and 525 wild bird sequences, adding 263 sequences to successive titrations resulting in 1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2 (domestic:wild) sequencing datasets with a final titration size of 1,575 sequences. We again applied a two-state asymmetric CTMC discrete trait diffusion model in which sequences were labelled as domestic or wild, and all priors and model parameters selected are the same as those described in the empirical tree set description above. To determine whether the proportion of turkeys to other domestic birds would impact the results of the previously described titration analysis we built a dataset in which the domestic bird group had equal numbers of turkey and domestic (non-turkey) sequences. This dataset included 173 turkey, 173 domestic bird and 692 wild bird sequences, totalling 1,038 sequences. Given that turkeys comprised 53.7% of commercial poultry outbreaks in the study period, this sampling regime conforms to both equal and proportional sampling regimes. We applied an asymmetric CTMC discrete trait diffusion model using a BSSVS for a three-trait model with the following states: wild birds, domestic birds (not turkey) and turkey. We performed three independent runs of this analysis using the models and parameters described in the empirical tree analysis section above. All titration replicates were performed using an MCMC chain length of 100 million states sampling every 10,000 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26"&gt;Commercial, backyard, wild-bird titration analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metadata and annotated sequences were made available describing sequences as being from backyard birds for sequences collected in early 2022 which distinguished them from commercial poultry (previously all sequences being determined domestic)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 15" title="Youk, S. et al.

This program assesses the phylogenetic structure of discrete traits across viral lineages using three metrics: the AI, parsimony score (PS) and maximum monophyletic clade size (MC). The AI measures the imbalance of internal nodes of a phylogeny for a given set of traits. The PS calculates the number of state changes in the phylogeny. The MC measures the maximum number of tips belonging to a monophyletic clade for each discrete trait of interest. These metrics are calculated for the phylogeny as tips are randomly swapped to create a null distribution to compare against. Taken together, these metrics quantify the degree of clustering within the phylogeny, with lower AI and PS values indicating stronger phylogenetic structure, suggesting that closely related taxa tend to share the same trait, whereas higher values indicate weaker structure and more-frequent transitions between trait states. Statistical significance was assessed by comparing observed values against a null distribution generated through randomization, with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values reported for each test. All discrete trait groupings showed evidence for clustering by trait, supporting the use of trait modelling across the tree.

As originally developed, a tip swap analysis attempts to assess the impact of trait sampling on discrete trait measurements. An operator is implemented within the MCMC chain that randomly picks pairs of tips and swaps their trait values, thus generating a posterior set of trees among which pairs of trait assignments have been randomly swapped. The probability of each state at the root is then computed, and compared to the inferred root state probabilities in the empirical data. As the root state probabilities in randomized datasets should primarily reflect the frequency of each trait in the analysis, empirical results that differ substantially from this null distribution are interpreted as evidence that the sequencing data are informing the analysis beyond what is expected based on trait frequencies alone. Thus, traits for which the root state probability differs considerably from the root state probability in the null data are frequently interpreted as being informed by the data, rather than sampling bias. While this approach has been shown to perform well on small phylogenies&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Lee, D.-H. et al.

In our flyways dataset, which includes around 1,000 tips, we found that, even with extremely high operator values (4,000), the traditional tip-swap analysis resulted in a posterior set of trees in which the majority of tips (93.3%) remained assigned to their true state at least 50% of the time, resulting in a null dataset that was only partially randomized. We believe that this is due to the high number of tips in our analysis, resulting in only an extremely small fraction of tips randomized at any given step in the MCMC chain. To overcome this limitation, we instead performed a randomized tip-shuffle analysis. Using the empirical set of trees inferred for each discrete trait analysis, we generated 100 null datasets in which we shuffled the trait assignments randomly across the tips. In this approach, we preserve the phylogenetic tree topology and the ratio of samples from each group, but shuffle their assignments at the tips. For each discrete trait analysis, we generated 100 distinct shuffled versions of the empirical trees, reran the analysis and summarized the resulting posterior distribution by inferring a maximum clade credibility tree. We then computed the root state probabilities for each trait for each MCC tree, and computed the mean root state probability across all 100 replicates. This computed mean is reported in Extended Data Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#Tab2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, in the column labelled ‘mean root state probability across 100 datasets with randomly shuffled tip states’. We then compared the root state probabilities in the empirical data (reported as ‘root state probability in empirical data’ in Extended Data Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09737-x#Tab2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) to the shuffled data as a measure of the impact of sampling on the results. As expected, the root state probabilities inferred in the shuffled datasets are proportional to the number of sequences included for each group. For the analyses using an equal sampling regime (migration, flyway, host orders equal and initial titration tests), this leads to approximately equal expected root state probabilities across groups. By contrast, the root state probabilities in the empirical data generally differ significantly from expectation, suggesting that the phylogenetic results are informed by the genetic data rather than from sampling alone.

Despite the increasing frequency of MARV outbreaks, no vaccines or therapeutics are licensed for use in humans. Here, we designed mutations that improve the expression, thermostability, and immunogenicity of the prefusion MARV glycoprotein (GP) ectodomain trimer, which is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines in development&lt;sup&gt;3–8&lt;/sup&gt;. We discovered a fully human, pan-marburgvirus monoclonal antibody, MARV16, that broadly neutralizes all MARV isolates as well as Ravn virus and Dehong virus with 40 to 100-fold increased potency relative to previously described antibodies&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, MARV16 provides therapeutic protection in guinea pigs challenged with MARV. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of MARV16-bound MARV GP showing that MARV16 recognizes a prefusion-specific epitope spanning GP1 and GP2, blocking receptor binding and preventing conformational changes required for viral entry. We further reveal the architecture of the MARV GP glycan cap, which shields the receptor binding site (RBS), underscoring architectural similarities with distantly related filovirus GPs. MARV16 and previously identified RBS-directed antibodies&lt;sup&gt;9–11&lt;/sup&gt; can bind MARV GP simultaneously. These antibody cocktails require multiple mutations to escape neutralization by both antibodies, paving the way for MARV therapeutics resilient to viral evolution. MARV GP stabilization along with the discovery of MARV16 advance prevention and treatment options for MARV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:31:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE85VVNOelR3QWhFTUk5M2JCX1V6UkQtZzBlS0VtZmdZcTRkSWg4aXFMWUkwY1kyeWhWWUFlRHhzRTFhNVJwUDNCWjBzZUZhVDdhUDM1VWt0NER3ZHdXRmJV</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，咖啡对心房颤动患者是安全的-今日医学新闻</title><link>https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/1-cup-of-coffee-a-day-may-lower-afib-recurrence-risk-by-39</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-oei5ji css-14vwexe"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/turkish-coffee-cup-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/turkish-coffee-cup-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/turkish-coffee-cup-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="eager" src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/turkish-coffee-cup-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="cup of Turkish coffee" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2F1-cup-of-coffee-a-day-may-lower-afib-recurrence-risk-by-39&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fturkish-coffee-cup-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Coffee%20is%20safe%20for%20people%20with%20atrial%20fibrillation%2C%20new%20study%20says" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/turkish-coffee-cup-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Should people with AFib avoid caffeine, or might it actually help their hearts?

Study participants were randomly selected to either drink at least 1 cup of caffeinated coffee a day or completely abstain from caffeine, for a period of 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Caffeinated coffee is the most commonly consumed beverage in the U.S., and the great majority of studies examining its health effects have been observational and not true experimental or interventional randomized trials,” &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/gregory.marcus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Gregory M. Marcus&lt;/a&gt;, MD, MAS, professor of medicine in the Division of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco, and lead author of this study, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such studies are inherently limited by confounding factors that travel with the various reasons why one person may decide to consume coffee versus not. Despite the absence of good evidence to recommend avoiding it, atrial fibrillation patients are often instructed by their treating physicians to stop consuming caffeine,” said Marcus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, researchers observed that study participants who drank 1 cup of caffeinated coffee each day lowered their risk of AFib recurrence by 39%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It is important to emphasize that these were participants randomly assigned to consume at least 1 cup of caffeinated coffee a day,” Marcus said. “This is the first long-term randomized trial of caffeinated coffee in general. A randomized study design is the best method we have to infer actual causal effects.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that those who were randomized to the coffee arm experienced a lower risk of atrial fibrillation should certainly reassure our atrial fibrillation patients that consume and enjoy caffeinated coffee and should provide data for health care providers that they should not generally prohibit their atrial fibrillation patients from consuming caffeinated coffee,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study also opens the door to future studies to determine if caffeinated coffee might actually be a tool to protect against atrial fibrillation,” Marcus pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus said there are several potential mechanisms that might explain why caffeine, and caffeinated coffee in particular, might reduce the risk for atrial fibrillation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First, atrial fibrillation often arises in states of heightened &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551575/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;vagal tone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, such as during sleep or after a heavy meal, and perhaps caffeine, by ramping up the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542195/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;sympathetic nervous system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; a bit, protects against that. Although caffeine is often considered something that might increase blood pressure, chronic caffeinated coffee consumption has been shown to be associated with a lower blood pressure, probably via a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diuretics" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;diuretic&lt;/a&gt; effect. A lower blood pressure probably protects against atrial fibrillation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Animal studies have suggested that caffeine prolongs the electrical recovery time, or electrical refractoriness, of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9410416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;left atrium&lt;/a&gt;, an electrophysiologic change that would be expected to suppress atrial fibrillation,” Marcus continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2204737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;CRAVE trial&lt;/a&gt; of randomization of a day at a time of caffeinated coffee versus a day at a time avoiding caffeine, we found that caffeinated coffee consumption was associated with, on average, 1,000 more steps per day as measured objectively using Fitbits. More physical activity has been shown to reduce atrial fibrillation recurrences among patients with the disease, and so perhaps those randomized to caffeinated coffee were more physically active,” he told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finally, coffee has many anti-inflammatory constituents, and inflammation is known to promote atrial fibrillation,” he suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/nikhil-p-warrier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nikhil Warrier&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified cardiac electrophysiologist and medical director of electrophysiology at MemorialCare Heart &amp;amp; Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warrier, who was not involved in the research, commented that he found the findings reassuring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Emerging evidence over the past few years has shown that moderate caffeine intake does not increase the risk of AFib,” Warrier explained. “Our current guidance to patients is that caffeine consumption within normal limits is associated with no added risk of AFib. This new randomized trial supports that approach and continues to help move us away from the blanket advice many patients previously received to avoid coffee intake altogether.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AFib is probably the most common &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8887" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart rhythm disorder&lt;/a&gt; that we treat today,” he told us. “It is also heavily impacted by lifestyle. We routinely counsel patients on the importance of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/weight-management" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;weight management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325353" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol intake, and regular exercise which all play a significant role in AFib development and recurrence.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how everyday habits affect AFib empowers patients and allows us to pair medical or procedural therapies with meaningful lifestyle modifications to improve long term outcomes,” said Warrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/renato-a-apolito/1319552" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Renato Apolito&lt;/a&gt;, MD, medical director of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and assistant program director of cardiology fellowship at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, about his research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people enjoy coffee and the effects of the caffeine in it every day,” Apolito, who was not involved in the study, commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, cardiologists have advised patients with AFib to limit or avoid their caffeine intake. As a stimulant, some intuitively deduce that caffeine can increase &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/235710" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt; and blood pressure so it is thought it could trigger or worsen heart rhythm problems, like AFib. This is all theoretical and I have never subscribed to that as it is a very weak effect in small, daily doses,” he told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results of this DECAF trial may suggest that cardiologists could change their recommendation in the future, and adults with AFib could continue to enjoy a minimal amount of coffee (a cup) each day,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this research is a welcomed first step, Apolito said, there are several factors that need to be scientifically studied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“For example, the study only enrolled people who already drink coffee and it was the only caffeinated substance reviewed,” he detailed. “The coffee intake was limited to ‘one cup’ a day. It would be interesting to see the results of studies looking at people with AFib who consumed more amounts of coffee, or different, naturally caffeinated beverages and in people who did not drink coffee prior to their AFib diagnosis.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:29:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQZU01N2M3NU1XVXhrY0dmbDdxYVNOWF9mcEhuNTJ5dlFRc2g4NHNIZExZeGFZVFhRNHA1cVBFT3pLM3IySzA5dFpwNHd5Q1Y3OXk4VGFFQ1dRMnFWQzFFQnllZ2dyLWlqaklsQzJVWmx0OUp2Y2xZZ1Rubi1xbXB5VlNyc3hucUNyWVIyQlAtX3V4RW5ieGNFTUM2TDdtTDhkQlE</guid></item><item><title>减少食盐摄入的4种方法-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/well/lower-salt-intake.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:00:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE16N0dMVXZzRkJrdDNTUFNRY0wtRjBPUERTMEhnX180R0JjVnNhSjBmREVtcDRONkhodVBBTXBEYmlONkVYZ2swbVJjcTlPOTFSaVVNdGRxbjFiaXhPbXh1cUUxSDFyVXpVWGZJelJLRQ</guid></item><item><title>我从不希望我的孩子指责我对我的钱不公平。但在这一系列项目上，我恐怕不得不这样做。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/11/money-advice-can-you-be-fair-between-kids.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhv1l78i001tpwksmo3xa1hv@published"&gt;So many people resent their parents for a lack of “fairness.” How do you handle “fairness” situations with your children when the circumstances are both similar and completely different? I have three kids, “Anna” (27), “Ben” (25), and “Caroline” (22). In most ways they received resources comparably growing up, but now unevenness is rearing its ugly head.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5n29u000m3b77x8oebagu@published"&gt;My company pays for the employees’ health insurance and then the employee can add (and pay for) additional insurance, including for kids. “Kids” insurance costs the same if you have one kid or six kids. When Anna and Ben graduated college and started working, I kept them on my insurance because I was already purchasing the “Kids” insurance for Caroline. Anna switched to her own insurance at 26 and Ben will be 26 soon and do the same. Caroline now has a full-time job with benefits, including insurance. Her insurance is not free, but costs significantly less than “Kids” at my company. I never had a stated plan to insure my children until they were 26—it just worked out that way for my older children and didn’t cost me any additional money. But it’s clearly a benefit they received courtesy of me that Caroline won’t receive.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5meu7000d3b77zq1ue6wb@published"&gt;So what’s fair/even? Birth order just is, and there are perks and disadvantages to all the spots? Caroline should get a subsidy from me to help with her insurance, even though I didn’t spend any extra money on her siblings? Just let it play out because no one can say who will need help with something else along the way?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5mezj000g3b77sg9l8bf7@published"&gt;Fairness doesn’t mean you have to do the exact same thing for all of your adult children. Support comes in different shapes, and for Anna and Ben, it just made sense to handle insurance the way you did. It didn’t cost you extra, so it wasn’t intended as preferential treatment. Caroline’s situation is different, and that’s just a matter of timing and how the plan is structured.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhw5mf1e000h3b77ucah5a7w@published"&gt;No, you don’t need to somehow make up for this by paying for Caroline’s insurance, especially if it’s something that she easily afford herself. Life is not this transactional, and there are plenty of other ways you can offer and show support—financial or otherwise—when she needs it. Over the years, each of your kids is going to have a different need. One of them might want to go to grad school. One of them might have kids and need childcare. If you spend all of your time keeping track of who gets what and trying to even it out with the others, you’ll drive yourself nuts. But what you can do is commit to being equitable over the long run. You’ll help each of your kids when it makes sense, when it’s within your means, and in ways that fit their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

Emphasize that you’ll continue to support all three of them when real needs arise, even if the form of help looks different.&lt;/p&gt;

If you handle this openly, this shouldn’t become a source of resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
