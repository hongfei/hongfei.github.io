    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqa1s800ed28p40supf0b4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As &lt;a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2025/12/aaa-year-end-holiday-travel-forecast/" target="_blank"&gt;millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt; hit the road or take to the skies for the holidays, another seasonal traveler is picking up speed: influenza.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000a3b6pp6bzu47u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu activity is already rising across the country. In the week ending December 13, roughly 4% of visits to health care providers were for respiratory illnesses, and nearly 10,000 patients were hospitalized with influenza, according to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-50.html" target="_blank"&gt;data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, released Friday. So far, three children already have died from flu-related causes this flu season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000b3b6pkmdix4zr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those numbers mean the virus may be closer to home than many families realize. Holiday gatherings could include someone just recovering from the flu, or someone beginning to feel sick. Should they still show up to open presents on Christmas morning? How long should a visit be postponed before heading to grandma’s to bake cookies?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000c3b6ptc6ytuut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As flu cases climb, here are the flu-related rules families should know this holiday season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000e3b6p2nrpbckz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are several over-the-counter flu tests available in the United States, and they can be taken at home as a nasal swab, similar to Covid-19 tests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000f3b6pz09khqpq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many doctors recommend taking a test as soon as you experience symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000g3b6pobmnbf81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Particularly if you’re a person in a high-risk group,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000h3b6p8ne8t389@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those persons are people who are age 65 and older, anyone who has a chronic underlying medical condition, if you’re immune compromised, if you’re a pregnant person and very young children,” he said. “Those are all people who are in high-risk, and once they have symptoms, that’s the time to get tested, because we would have antivirals available to help keep you out of the hospital.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqa4t400003b6pn9ba9c8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu symptoms usually start suddenly with fever, chills, headache, body aches and fatigue, Dr. Pamela Lindor, a pediatrician at Bluebird Kids Health in Jacksonville, Florida, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvemf7002b3b6pvfqqgaeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While you should quickly start treatment and avoid exposing others when you test positive for flu, “if the over the counter test is negative but your symptoms are severe, consider getting a more accurate test from your doctor or urgent care center,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000i3b6pq7ud6plx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Testing is key because once it is determined which respiratory illness you have, you can then receive appropriate treatment, Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000j3b6pthof7fd3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Flu is not the only illness we’re concerned about. Maybe you have Covid, and if you have Covid, we have another medication that could help keep you out of the hospital,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000l3b6pa2a1im44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;antiviral drugs&lt;/a&gt;, such as Tamiflu or Xofluza, are prescription medications, and they work best when started early, ideally within two days after flu symptoms begin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000m3b6pipsesvhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For the flu, if you are ill, the sooner you begin the antiviral, the more effective it is,” Schaffner said. “There is the 48-hour rule. That is, for it to be maximally effective, you have to initiate treatment within the first 48 hours after you get symptoms. But even after 48 hours – and this is especially true for high-risk people – you can still have some modulating effect of the antivirals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000o3b6pkszo022t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As soon as someone starts to show symptoms, they should stay home and avoid contact with other people to not spread the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000p3b6ppam78qp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’re capable of transmitting the influenza virus the day before you get symptoms,” Schaffner said. “But nonetheless, wear a mask and avoid other people in your family as much as possible until your symptoms start to abate and you’ve had no fever for 24 hours without using Tylenol.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000q3b6phrc1drjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the CDC, people can return to their normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, they have not had a fever without using fever-reduction medication, and their overall symptoms are improving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvgd8d002m3b6pa1k022el@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This will usually be at least 4-5 days,” Lindor said. “Flu is most contagious starting the day before symptoms develop and continuing for about one week.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000s3b6pli9n7gb9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people who have symptoms or fever might be tempted to still visit family or open Christmas gifts with loved ones, as long as they wear a mask, but Schaffner still warned against it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000t3b6py0zaykoa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’ve developed symptoms, I think you’ve got to stay home,” Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000u3b6ptcip4j16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even if you say, ‘Well, I have these symptoms, but I’ll wear a mask.’ Yes, that will reduce the chance of spreading but not reduce it to zero. And guess what? It’s very hard to eat and drink with a mask on,” he said. “So, you will indeed be exposing people. And when you get to family members, even when you wear that mask, they’ll be hugging and kissing. These are very close circumstances, so you’ve got to restrain yourself and separate yourself, otherwise you are very much in danger of becoming a dreaded spreader.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvoi3q002z3b6pj0bxvehi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While someone with flu should take precautions to isolate themselves and not expose others, there are important steps their household members also can take to reduce their risk of getting sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvqa3y003a3b6p70vnu93r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good handwashing is very important to prevent spread,” Lindor said. “Common surfaces in the house should be disinfected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000w3b6pp4ww10no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some doctors may prescribe antiviral medications to people who have been exposed to someone with flu, but they are not yet showing signs or symptoms themselves, especially if that person is in a high-risk group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvogqs002x3b6pyq50jf8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Tamiflu can be prescribed to people who have been exposed to the flu, and is usually taken for 7-10 days to prevent infection,” Lindor said. “Xofluza can also be used prophylactically, and only one dose is needed, for adults and children 5 or older.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000x3b6pf9i36iiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, a 22-year-old college student may travel home for Christmas to visit their grandfather. The next day, after they have already visited their grandfather, they test positive for the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000y3b6plfl51ksj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Their grandfather is obviously in a high-risk group. Should the grandfather take Tamiflu for five days? That’s not a bad idea,” Schaffner said. “In that circumstance, it could very well avert the influenza infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300103b6p43zxhtdl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s important to stay in contact with your doctor once you test positive for flu and experience worsening symptoms, especially if you are in a high-risk group, Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300113b6pvdkxbse9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And with your doctor, “have those discussions about when it is that you need to go to the hospital,” he said. “But difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, really feeling terrible, temperatures of 103 or higher – all of those things are indicators that you really need medical attention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvtdmi003g3b6po36s9upi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some other “warning signs” that may require urgent medical attention include “dehydration, chest pain, lethargy, mental status changes, seizures or severe weakness,” Lindor said. “Confusion, behavior changes, or high persistent fever for over 3 days also warrant urgent medical attention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300133b6pg6wainq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is still time to receive your seasonal flu shot if you haven’t already.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300143b6p5lzbcy2v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For all those people out there who are still well, if you haven’t been vaccinated, please get the vaccine. Don’t linger,” Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300153b6plmkiy2u1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s a holiday present to you and to everyone else around you,” he said. “There’s more than one kind of influenza virus out there, and the vaccine helps prevent serious disease due to three different types of influenza virus.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvueqr003o3b6p46j2ysw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lindor said that overall, the best way to avoid having the flu disrupt family gatherings during the holidays is “for all family members to get their flu vaccine early in the flu season each year.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

However, at this point, some experts list &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-benefits-of-whole-grains" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:whole grains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; as a top candidate. This is because whole grains show some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10334137/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:minor evidence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;minor evidence&lt;/a&gt; for potentially boosting mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirkpatrick noted that a plant-based Mediterranean diet &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8780598/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:has been associated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;has been associated&lt;/a&gt; with lower depression scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Noteworthy in this diet was the inclusion of omega-3 fatty acids, colorful plants like berries, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/video/extra-virgin-olive-oil/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:extra virgin olive oil;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;extra virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/leafy-green-vegetables/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leafy greens;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;leafy greens&lt;/a&gt;, and lean sources of protein,” she said. “In addition to this, supplementation with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35816192/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31383846/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fish oil;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fish oil&lt;/a&gt; (especially if marine-based foods are low in the diet) has been shown to assist with both depression and anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that the gut and the brain operate in continuous and bidirectional communication has been around since &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33493503/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ancient Greece;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;. Modern brain imaging has been able to show that gut stimuli can activate certain areas of the brain that are involved with emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirkpatrick added that it is essential to recognize the role the microbiome plays in influencing mental health outcomes. This means a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/22-high-fiber-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diet high in fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;diet high in fiber&lt;/a&gt;, probiotics, and prebiotics should also be focused on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains contain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10498976/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fermentable fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fermentable fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which bacteria in the gut can digest.

Limits should be made on sugar, refined grains, UPF [ultra-processed foods], and &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol/personality-change-when-drinking-alcohol/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, while an attention to getting plenty of color and high nutrient density should be focused on,” Kirkpatrick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to this, managing stress, exercise, and adequate, high quality sleep are also important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She offered the following tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to get desserts during the holidays, focus on ones that actually may help you, like dark chocolate and berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When at a party, limit alcohol to help with portion control. Then eat until you are no longer hungry, not till you’re full. This may look like trying everything, but having just a bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substitute when you can at holiday meals, for example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use extra virgin &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12174621/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:olive oil instead of butter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;olive oil instead of butter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use yogurt instead of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/heavy-cream-substitutes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cream;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use cauliflower puree instead of white potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have wild fatty fish instead of red meat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drink seltzer water with fresh lemon or lime instead of sugary drinks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routhenstein noted the following ways you may be able to support your mood and mental health with food during the holidays:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; Think about meals, gatherings, and activities in advance to reduce last-minute stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain your routine:&lt;/strong&gt; Try not to stray too far from your regular sleep, movement, and eating habits. Small consistency matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set boundaries: &lt;/strong&gt;Protect your time and energy, say no when needed, and carve out moments for rest or self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindful indulgence:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoy holiday treats in a way that feels satisfying without feeling extreme or restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Combining mindful nutrition with stress management can help you feel more balanced, energized, and emotionally resilient during the holidays,” said Routhenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/mood-boosting-happiness-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Healthline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:16:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5BLXJDdGNtdjMwNktpWTdENXhjcGNNckcxOVo1R25yVGpWMndSNWZuNGRVeG9Zc2Q5N2V4UUdPaGhmakxlcGRzU1FIT0hzOGNKbUtnUncyaGJTUXVaUFhXbnU4M1FEQVFMekZDZGpOUGNteEZZenlITFBsb19DUQ</guid></item><item><title>如果有人通常在早上不吃早餐，他们就会低调地挣扎于这11件事- YourTango</title><link>https://www.yourtango.com/self/if-someone-usually-skips-breakfast-morning-theyre-lowkey-struggling-these-things</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is named the “most important meal of the day” for a reason. Not only does it tend to jumpstart the metabolism and increase nutrition throughout the day, according to &lt;a href="https://www.rush.edu/news/why-you-should-eat-breakfast" rel="nofollow"&gt;the Rush University System for Health&lt;/a&gt;, but it also improves cognitive function, performance, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if someone usually skips breakfast in the morning, it's likely that they’re lowkey struggling with certain things, no matter how much they try to hide it. The seemingly small decision to skip breakfast has big consequences. It may feel like they’re too busy to wake up early or not hungry enough to eat breakfast, but in the end, it’s their well-being that’s at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If someone usually skips breakfast in the morning, they’re lowkey struggling with these 11 things&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.  Time management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-12/if-someone-usually-skips-breakfast-in-morning-lowkey-struggling-things-time-management.png" alt="Man struggling with time management and drinking coffee" title="time management if someone usually skips breakfast in the morning they're lowkey struggling with these things" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;PeopleImages | Shutterstock.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time management is a struggle for many people, especially when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.morningside.edu/news/mastering-time-management-consistency-and-study-habits-in-academics" rel="nofollow"&gt;setting priorities and minimizing distractions&lt;/a&gt;. For people who regularly deal with chaotic mornings and unprepared rituals, distractions may be their only way to get through the day without falling victim to stress and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they didn’t get enough sleep, chances are skipping breakfast is their only way of reclaiming some time. They scroll from their phones in the morning and struggle to set a schedule, so by the time they need to leave the house, they’re already rushing around to get the bare necessities done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-productive-people-do-every-morning-lazy-people-hit-snooze"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Things Productive People Do Every Morning That Lazy People Hit Snooze On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

So, if someone isn’t getting enough sleep every night and consistently wakes up feeling tired, anxious, and unrested, breakfast might be one of the first things they sacrifice to snooze their alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it leads to more fatigue later in the day and consistently lower energy levels, it feels like the only thing they can do to cope with their chronic tiredness in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.  Chaotic mornings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s mothers feeling burdened by caring for their kids and prepping their households or someone struggling with a lack of sleep before going to work, if someone usually skips breakfast, they may be lowkey struggling with morning chaos. Everything feels “behind,” there are a million responsibilities to get through, and never enough time, which leads to sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially considering stress hormones associated with emotional exhaustion and chaos affect appetite, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453000000354?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow"&gt;a study published in the Psychoneuroendocrinology journal&lt;/a&gt;, someone skipping breakfast may not even feel hungry enough to carve out time for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/subtle-signs-not-just-stressed-completely-exhausted-emotionally"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 Subtle Signs You're Not Just Stressed, You're Completely Exhausted Emotionally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Decision fatigue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone has so many responsibilities and stressors that they don’t know where to start, that’s often called &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/decision-fatigue" rel="nofollow"&gt;decision fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. There are so many decisions to make and things to prioritize that, when it comes to actually doing them, especially amid the morning pressure, nothing gets done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of struggle may also worsen mental clarity and energy, leading to avoidant behaviors that keep people from routines and habits that actually add value. From eating breakfast to going to bed early, and even disconnecting from technology, the more possible decisions a person has, the more likely they are to rely on easy, convenient choices to cope, even if they’re not healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-smart-people-do-in-the-morning-normal-people-cant-stand"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Things Smart People Do In The Morning That Normal People Can't Stand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

Disconnection from their body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone feels a lack of control, chances are they’re simultaneously &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-derealization-overview"&gt;feeling disconnected from themselves&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t have a stable kind of trust in their bodies, and they often struggle to listen to small cues, such as fatigue or anxiety, that bubble up internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They lean on avoidance and distractions to get through the day, so in the morning, when they’re working to avoid constant stress and worry, eating is the last thing on their mind. Especially if it forces them to lean into quiet time and mindfulness, prioritizing can feel entirely destabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. A survival mindset&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with a &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrycentre.co.uk/blog/am-i-in-survival-mode-how-to-know-and-what-to-do-about-it/" rel="nofollow"&gt;survival mindset is likely more willing to sacrifice seemingly unnecessary habits&lt;/a&gt; like eating breakfast to focus on the small things that really matter. If someone usually skips breakfast in the morning, they may feel like they’re coping with avoidance. They’re focusing on things they view as obligations, while sabotaging their well-being by avoiding self-care and rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s exhausting to feel like you’re surviving, rather than living. You miss out on the joy because you’re so caught up in the obligation and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health/signs-youre-stuck-in-survival-mode"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 Signs You're Stuck In Survival Mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8.

Alongside this stress and obligation, skipping breakfast or meals may feel like the only way to show up. But if you’re not taking care of yourself, you’ll have less energy, love, and attention to offer the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t let caretaking burn you out. Carve out mindful time to connect with yourself, even if it means waking up 5 minutes earlier to have breakfast and reflect on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.

If your brain and body are too caught up in the stress of managing depression or chronic stress, chances are your motivation to make time for things like working out or eating breakfast is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone skips breakfast in the morning, they’re lowkey struggling with these things. They’re trying to cope with stress and inner emotional strain, but missing out on the benefits of small rituals and routines that add structure and intentionality to their days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/habits-help-mental-health-cant-see-therapist"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 Tiny Habits That'll Help Your Mental Health (If You Can't See A Therapist)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. A lack of routine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A routine, especially in the morning, &lt;a href="https://www.restorationpsychservices.com/post/rise-shine-how-a-fulfilling-morning-routine-transforms-your-life" rel="nofollow"&gt;can set the tone for the entire day&lt;/a&gt;. It can provide structure for you to manage discomfort, help to relieve stress, and even energize you when things feel chaotic. However, people who miss out on small rituals and routines, like eating breakfast, often find themselves wandering aimlessly amid these stressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s work obligations or stress with parenting, people who skip breakfast sabotage their routines. They’re forced to do more heavy lifting in the afternoon when they’re feeling exhausted and often battle through a morning fog that could easily be addressed with a quick meal first thing in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Poor work-life balance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone has poor work-life balance and vague boundaries, chances are their morning routines are riddled with stress and obligations. Whether it’s responding to work emails from bed, when their brains are supposed to be rising naturally, or skipping breakfast to get into work earlier, they regularly put their own well-being on hold for the sake of misguided company loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it seems impossible to ignore, there’s always space to carve out room for yourself. Poor work-life balance &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9819779/" rel="nofollow"&gt;negatively affects your health&lt;/a&gt;, and if you’re not meeting yourself where you are with nutrition, healthy rituals, and self-care, you push yourself closer to burnout every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/art-unplugging-habits-people-clock-out-mentally-not-just-physically"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art Of Unplugging: 3 Simple Habits Of People Who Clock Out Mentally, Not Just Physically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaydaslabbekoorn/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zayda Slabbekoorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a senior editorial strategist with a bachelor’s degree in social relations &amp;amp; policy and gender studies who focuses on psychology, relationships, self-help, and human interest stories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="midcat-most-popular"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Related Stories From YourTango:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 10:36:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOQzFJdUxxQkFWdVJ0bjN0b3k5NVFTT19udjJaLWN3bjk0QXF2SW1odi0zb1JiSV9RRUFyNFdEek9zWXhkdjBwUC1VS2E1T194ZG1CV29tVEtDQ096U2hGdlRMbG9PbG9WZHBfSnRiak80S1lseTh4R0RtaF8xZ2pyT0pOTTc0dEwyX2RyeVU3aENlc2pEWVhRX2Q4ZWFTZ25VVk1xcGhsNE41Vm5mRlVRbw</guid></item><item><title>什么是悲伤攻击？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/well/mind/grief-attack.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 10:02:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFAzZmlpWVRNS1ZiQXZfVFAyRWdBRVBGRFRjX2F3NlptS3UwemtLSmFMQlRZRmhqSXRUdl9HZjJOQ1ZqZjRicVpPT2thbTJZaUZKb0RtM3VRT0lDWUkyT3RGeFNVdW4tRk1Oa1lnOWsxZw</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州的这个家庭是美国一代人中最大的麻疹爆发的一部分-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/us/measles-outbreak-texas-timmons.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 10:00:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE15T2FSemR6VFJMYUFxTWM0dGN3MWxpUE94SXBDOFRXZlIzdzlOQUR1aFFrZTliSGhGQ3VHaW4xNjJKOTRZT1k2VDgtSlJOcVNLU3VsMkxPUFFQSzItRjFYNkFTQms4a0N6ZEtVVDZyUFYxbWpaVVpRZ016ZW9lUQ</guid></item><item><title>一顿丰盛的节日大餐对你的大脑有什么影响？ - BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251222-what-does-a-huge-festive-meal-do-to-your-brain</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="more-like-this:" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;More like this:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;• &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20241126-why-humans-feel-the-need-to-feast-together" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Why we all enjoy a good feast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;• &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250822-the-best-foods-to-help-you-sleep-better" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;The surprising foods that make you sleep better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;• &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240730-is-eating-in-front-of-the-tv-really-that-bad-for-you" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Should you eat in front of the TV?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This study expands on existing research, Kullman says, showing the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21275082/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;communication between our guts and brains&lt;/a&gt;, and how the axis is different for people who are obese.

Close contacts to the Alaskan patient have been identified and are undergoing notification, risk assessment and monitoring, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Mpox is &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mpox" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mpox"&gt;spread through physical contact&lt;/a&gt; with an infected individual, contaminated materials, or infected animals, and can last two to four weeks, according to the World Health Organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Mpox, which has an incubation period ranging from three to 17 days, becomes infectious at the onset of symptoms, such as fever, chills, fatigue, lesions and rash, according to the health alert.

Why winter months increase risk of heart attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Rajesh T R, Director and Senior Consultant, Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery (CTVS) at KIMS Hospitals, Bengaluru, explained that winter weather can significantly strain heart health.&lt;/span&gt; Cold temperatures cause blood vessels to constrict, raising &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-pressure" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and forcing the heart to work harder, while sudden exposure to cold can trigger spikes in heart rate and reduce oxygen supply, especially risky for those with blocked arteries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/10/550x309/heart_attack_winter3_1765369600816_1765369619874.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Winter heightens heart attack risks due to respiratory infections and unhealthy habits.(Image generated via Google Gemini)" title="Winter heightens heart attack risks due to respiratory infections and unhealthy habits.(Image generated via Google Gemini)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Winter heightens heart attack risks due to respiratory infections and unhealthy habits.(Image generated via Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Winter also increases the risk of respiratory infections, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating, and thicker blood, all of which elevate the chances of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To reduce risk, he advised dressing warmly, staying physically active indoors, eating heart-healthy foods, staying hydrated, and closely managing existing conditions like hypertension and diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Why heart attack symptoms in women often get missed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Sanjay Kumar, Senior Director of Cardiology at Fortis Hospital, Faridabad, explains that heart attack symptoms in women are often difficult to detect because they are usually subtle and atypical.&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Women tend to have smaller coronary vessels and more diffuse plaque, which makes the disease harder to diagnose and increases the risk of recurrence,” he says, adding that, unlike men, women may not experience classic chest pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, warning signs can include jaw or upper &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/back-pain" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="back pain"&gt;back pain&lt;/a&gt;, nausea, palpitations, unexplained sweating, and breathlessness even during light activity, symptoms that are often mistaken for stress, acidity, or fatigue. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He emphasises that while these signs may overlap with other conditions, experiencing one or more should prompt a timely medical evaluation to rule out underlying heart disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. What slow heart rate (bradycardia) means for your health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Dilip Kumar, Senior Interventional Cardiologist and Device Specialist at Manipal Hospital, Kolkata, explains that bradycardia is a condition in which the heart consistently beats slower than 60 beats per minute, which can be concerning as it may reduce the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the body.&lt;/span&gt; “While a slow &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/womans-entire-skin-peels-off-like-a-snake-after-a-spider-bite-my-heart-rate-was-stuck-between-140-160-for-days-101766048478518.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart rate"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt; can be normal in athletes, in others it may point to a problem with the heart’s electrical system,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/05/550x309/slow_heart_rate_1759631860553_1759631869382.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="While an abnormal heart rhythm with a fast heart rate can range from mild to life-threatening, often people ignore a slow heart rate.

(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Older adults, people with heart disease, diabetes or kidney issues, and those on certain medications are at higher risk and should be cautious. Common warning signs include persistent fatigue, dizziness, fainting spells, breathlessness during mild activity, and chest discomfort. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Although not all causes are preventable, Dr Kumar notes that a heart-healthy lifestyle, stress management, and regular medical check-ups can help lower the risk and detect issues early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Festive indulgence and its hidden impact on heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Abhijit Khadtare, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-with-40-years-experience-reveals-the-1-number-resting-heart-quietly-reveals-how-strong-your-heart-really-is-101766370110581.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiologist"&gt;cardiologist&lt;/a&gt; at Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, shared that while festive celebrations are not inherently dangerous, the drastic lifestyle changes that often come with them can pose serious risks for people with heart disease and diabetes. He noted that hospitals typically witness a post-holiday rise in emergency admissions related to heart attacks, uncontrolled blood sugar levels and blood pressure crises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to him, common festive challenges include overeating foods high in sugar, salt and saturated fats, disrupted sleep and medication routines, alcohol consumption, and emotional exhaustion from socialising and travel, all of which can strain the heart and upset metabolic balance even over a short period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

With technological advances and innovations, researchers and doctors have managed to support people’s well-being even over once fatal diseases. However, there are still some disorders that leave us quite unnerved when they strike — dementia being one of them. A common and disabling disease that affects the brain, dementia occurs when brain cells are damaged or die, leading to progressive declines in cognitive functions, mood, behavior, and personality. It’s an umbrella term used to describe a range of neurological conditions affecting the brain that worsen over time, and it remains one of the world’s most urgent public health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently over 55 million people with dementia worldwide, with nearly 10 million new cases of dementia developing each year. The number of people with dementia is growing worldwide and is expected to triple by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Understanding the link between Magnesium and Vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With dementia rates climbing and no real cure in sight, researchers are turning their focus to simple lifestyle changes — especially what we eat — to keep our brains healthy as we age. Over the years, magnesium has become a hot topic when it comes to fighting this disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an essential mineral, involved in loads of things our bodies do every day, and it might help slow down brain aging and lower the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s hopeful and interesting about magnesium being a potential ally in the fight against dementia is that, unlike fancy medications or complicated treatments, you can get magnesium from everyday foods like leafy greens, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and beans. Sure, supplements are available too, but when it comes to supplements, it’s always better to consult a professional healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, here’s what looks promising from the research corner: new studies hint that getting more magnesium than usual could mean better brain structure, sharper thinking, and a lower chance of developing dementia as the years go by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="31651892" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="magnesium-and-dementia" source="keywords"&gt;Magnesium and dementia&lt;/keyword&gt;: Understanding the link&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what is magnesium, and why does your brain care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, magnesium keeps hundreds of chemical reactions running smoothly in your body. It’s key for things like making energy, helping nerves fire, and managing blood sugar. You’ll find it naturally in lots of foods — those leafy greens, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains. Since the brain relies on a complicated web of chemical reactions, getting enough magnesium is important for good thinking and smooth communication between brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does research say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big study with over 6,000 adults found that people who got more magnesium — about 550 mg a day or more — had healthier brains compared to folks who stuck closer to 350 mg. We’re talking bigger overall brain volume and fewer white matter lesions, which are both good signs for avoiding dementia and aging well. This research from the Neuroimaging and Brain Lab at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/eating-more-magnesium-each-day-keeps-dementia-at-bay" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Australian National University (ANU)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; showed that people with higher magnesium intake had brains that looked a year younger than their actual age. This effect was especially noticeable in women after menopause, which could be thanks to magnesium’s anti-inflammatory powers. Now, although these results look good and show promise, experts stress that studies like this only establish the link — this is not direct proof that magnesium stops dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How magnesium may influence &lt;keyword id="20018982" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="brain-health" source="keywords"&gt;brain health&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists think the miracle mineral might work in a few ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It helps keep the brain’s structure solid. People with more magnesium tend to have bigger brains and less shrinkage — markers that go along with lower dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium calms inflammation, which is tied to the start of diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It keeps nerve signals firing properly and helps brain cells make energy, which are both crucial for learning and memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since some types of dementia are linked to blood flow problems in the brain, magnesium’s ability to help control blood pressure and blood sugar can offer extra protection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to incorporate magnesium into your daily diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get more magnesium, you should *always* start with the food. Spinach, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are all great options, and they bring along other nutrients your brain loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements are an option too, especially if you have trouble hitting your daily target with food alone. But healthcare providers usually recommend focusing on food first. In case you want to sign up for supplements, always check in with them before adding them to your diet, since too much magnesium can cause stomach issues or interact with certain medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 06:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>如果您有高血压，应避免的5种补充剂-健康：值得信赖和富有同理心的健康和保健信息</title><link>https://www.health.com/supplements-to-avoid-with-high-blood-pressure-11874436</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing hypertension (high blood pressure) is necessary to lower your risk of other health conditions, like heart attack or stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To best manage high blood pressure, you may need to avoid certain supplements because they can affect your blood pressure or make your blood pressure medication less effective.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements with GA can also interact with diuretics and blood pressure medications. The supplement may affect how well blood pressure medication works and raise your risk of side effects. Specifically, licorice root can raise sodium levels and lower potassium levels in your body. This effect, combined with a diuretic, can lead to dangerously &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/hypokalemia-symptoms-7966570" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low levels of potassium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high blood pressure, it's best to avoid using products with licorice root.

Despite its historical use as a traditional medicine, the plant may dangerously interact with a variety of medications. St. John's wort weakens the effects of many medications, including some used to treat high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These interactions likely occur because St. John's wort blocks the medication from being absorbed in the body as it normally would.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bitter orange (&lt;em&gt;Citrus aurantium&lt;/em&gt;) is taken from the fruit or peel of a bitter orange. The fruit and its peel can be used to add flavor to drinks or aromas to perfumes. The bitter orange supplement is often used to help with weight loss and improve sports performance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bitter orange contains p-Synephrine, a type of stimulant similar to ephedrine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned ephedrine stimulants because they can cause health issues like stroke and heart attack.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though bitter orange is not banned, it should be used with extreme caution.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies have shown that bitter orange supplements can raise blood pressure and heart rate. The supplement can also raise your risk for other serious side effects like stroke and heart attack.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, bitter orange found in food and drinks is not likely to affect your blood pressure or cause these side effects.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People may respond to certain supplements differently. Factors that may affect how you respond to a supplement include genetics, diet and nutrition, age, gut health, and overall health status. Take note of any side effects or symptoms you experience when starting a new supplement or vitamin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before starting any new vitamins or supplements, talk to your doctor. They can help you decide if the vitamin or supplement would be useful and safe for you to take. Your doctor can also compare the new supplement to all the medications, vitamins, and other supplements you already take to identify potential interactions.

Together they have helped identify, and therefore stem, potentially disastrous outbreaks of yellow fever in Nigeria, mpox in Sierra Leone and Marburg virus in Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Few people have heard of Happi and Sabeti, yet they not only run a &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/pardis_sabeti_and_christian_happi_a_virus_detection_network_to_stop_the_next_pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;virus detection network to stop the next deadly pandemic&lt;/a&gt; but are also breaking down inequity between Africa and the global north by empowering African scientists to improve African lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Their project, Sentinel, is an early warning framework co-created by Nigeria’s Institute of Genomics and Global Health and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Housed inside the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), the programme uses genomics, surveillance and sequencing technology to identify new pathogens and then packages the science so it is ready-made for governments to act on. Since its inception, Sentinel – initially funded by a TED-Audacious Project grant – has proved an extraordinarily effective idea, says its managing director, Dr Al Ozonoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b61836c0-c4fe-450a-b00f-7a358874664a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;The laboratory at the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases were the Sentinel project is based.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Ajayi Oluwapelumi/AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While Happi’s work responding to critical outbreaks has saved lives, just as important, Ozonoff believes, is his “vision of African scientists working at the cutting edge of their fields to improve life for everyday Africans”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sentinel has trained more than 3,000 health professionals across 53 of Africa’s 54 countries in genomics so they too are better able to track, identify and respond to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In light of global aid cuts, Happi had been worried about Sentinel’s survival. Development assistance for health is estimated to drop to $39.1bn by the end of 2025 as the US, UK and other countries reduce their overseas development funding. The MacArthur grant will allow Sentinel to train more academics and health professionals in harder to reach places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Happi, who starts each day with a prayer and a walk, recalls the first time he put the idea behind Sentinel to good use. It was 2014 and he got the middle-of-the-night phone call that, he says, “you never want to receive”. It was Nigeria’s ministry of health. There was a suspected case of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; in Lagos. Could he confirm it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I got chills, goose pimples. I prayed that wasn’t going to be the case,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4960747b-315b-4bd0-b60b-70bb28647e68" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Happi holds a miniPCR Thermal Cycler, equipment used to amplify segments of DNA.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Pius Utomi Ekpei/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Happi drove to his rudimentary, at the time, two-room laboratory on Redeemer’s University campus, where he remains a professor, and said goodbye to his wife, Dr Anise Happi, deputy director of zoonotic research and surveillance at ACEGID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ebola, which within two years would kill more than 11,325 people in west Africa, had already claimed the lives of many healthcare workers. He did not know if he would see Anise or their three children again. “She told me: ‘I will pray for you. I know you’ll be back,’” Happi recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Working through the heat of the night, sodden in their own sweat and exposed to the deadly infection they were testing, Happi and his assistant were able to confirm within a matter of hours that Ebola had arrived in Nigeria. The country mobilised. Just 42 days later, Nigeria was able to declar itself &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/nigeria-ebola-crackdown-example-to-world" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Ebola free&lt;/a&gt;. Out of the confirmed 20 cases, eight people died. Each death a tragedy, but nothing like the scale that could have faced the country of 186 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fae26f38-b34a-40d5-b3f6-0a081dd2bcfb" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;An information board form 2014 in Lagos’s Oshodi Heritage park reads ‘No Shaking !

From there, the idea – detection of pathogenic threats in real time while stopping diseases before they spread – grew. Build Health International (BHI), a non-profit that builds infrastructure in low-resource settings, upgraded Happi and Sabeti’s little lab to a state-of-the-art genomics centre – this time with air conditioning – and by 2020, when Covid hit, the team was well equipped to have the full genome within 48 hours of the first case arriving in Nigeria.

It was a shock,” he says. “I never dreamed that in my career I would have this kind of money at once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When Happi called Ansara, his words were simple: “Get ready,” says Ansara – a nod to the infrastructure that may be needed as part of Sentinel’s mission to train more scientists and embed pandemic preparedness in public health systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are not going to be judged by just the fact that we got this money but [for] what we do with this money,” says Happi, who says it is time to put “500%” into the work. He and Sabeti have undoubtedly saved thousands of lives but he remains humble and focused on the lives still to save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f7e6b150-e653-4cbe-9dd8-871279dcf74a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Anise and Christian Happi at the Time 100 Gala.

			&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence suggests that the key to treating  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="186587" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; is catching it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-hidden-in-the-brain-may-reveal-alzheimers-years-in-advance"&gt;in its earliest stages&lt;/a&gt;. Now scientists have developed a promising new drug that seems to be effective at stalling the disease before it really gets started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is called NU-9, and a team from Northwestern University in the US tested it on mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. They found that it's able to significantly lower the levels of toxic protein molecules called amyloid beta oligomers, which can aggregate into the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;harmful plaque clumps&lt;/a&gt; associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With NU-9 deployed, far fewer of these oligomers were detected in the mouse brains. This in turn kept brain support cells &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/genetic-tweaks-in-astrocytes-could-be-key-to-alzheimers-treatment"&gt;called astrocytes&lt;/a&gt; in a calmer, healthier state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microdosing-cannabis-pauses-alzheimers-decline-in-unprecedented-trial"&gt;Microdosing Cannabis Pauses Alzheimer's Decline in Unprecedented Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results are stunning," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/12/nu-9-halts-alzheimers-disease-in-animal-model-before-symptoms-begin"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurobiologist William Klein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NU-9 had an outstanding effect on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrogliosis"&gt;reactive astrogliosis&lt;/a&gt;, which is the essence of neuroinflammation and linked to the early stage of [Alzheimer's] disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study wasn't just about examining the impact of NU-9, though: it was also about improving our understanding of how Alzheimer's develops, long before any symptoms appear, which is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-distinct-patterns-may-signal-alzheimers-according-to-science"&gt;likely to be crucial&lt;/a&gt; in researching new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186590" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186590" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronProgress.jpg" alt="Neuron progress diagram" class="wp-image-186590 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronProgress.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronProgress-600x630.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186590" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked the growing influence of amyloid beta oligomers (green) and their influence on reactive astrocytes (red). (Kranz et al., &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mice used in the study, the researchers discovered a previously unknown subtype of amyloid beta oligomer. They called it ACU193&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and found it was one of the first to show up in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stress-sensitive-neurons-may-have-a-powerful-effect-on-our-entire-brain"&gt;stressed neurons&lt;/a&gt;, attaching itself to astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While astrocytes are crucial to a smoothly operating brain, they can also become dangerous if they get overactive. The scientists behind the study think ACU193&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; could trigger this transition – and give us a potential way to slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's disease begins decades before its symptoms appear, with early events like toxic amyloid beta oligomers accumulating inside neurons and glial cells becoming reactive long before memory loss is apparent," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/12/nu-9-halts-alzheimers-disease-in-animal-model-before-symptoms-begin"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Northwestern neuroscientist Daniel Kranz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By the time symptoms emerge, the underlying pathology is already advanced. This is likely a major reason many &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-expert-says"&gt;clinical trials have failed&lt;/a&gt;. They start far too late."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth bearing in mind that there's still a way to go before we can be sure that amyloid beta – in either oligomer or plaque form – is directly driving Alzheimer's. It's probable that multiple triggers and factors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-cause-of-alzheimers-might-be-coming-from-inside-your-mouth"&gt;are involved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NU-9 has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2402117122"&gt;previously been shown&lt;/a&gt; to prevent amyloid beta oligomer build-up in human brain cells in the lab, so is encouraging to see that it seems to also work in live animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More testing is now underway: the researchers are looking at how effective NU-9 is in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease in a later stage of progression, which is thought to better reflect how it takes hold in people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/reducing-your-bioenergetic-age-may-ward-off-alzheimers-study-finds"&gt;as they age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only after all that could it potentially progress to human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="186587" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all goes as hoped, NU-9 could become a preventative treatment that can be taken by people at high risk of developing Alzheimer's later in life. The researchers compare it to cholesterol-lowering drugs that are taken to reduce the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-protein-is-a-better-predictor-of-heart-disease-than-cholesterol"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If someone has a biomarker signaling Alzheimer's disease, then they could start taking NU-9 before symptoms appear," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/12/nu-9-halts-alzheimers-disease-in-animal-model-before-symptoms-begin"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Klein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a couple of early diagnostic blood tests for Alzheimer's disease in development. The promise of better early diagnostics – combined with a drug that could stop the disease in its tracks – is the goal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70968"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a label I’d only recently acquired. A year ago, it had seemed silly to obtain government proof of what we’d known to be true for six years: We were life partners. Now I was so grateful we signed that piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier that morning, I’d driven my husband to an ER in Torrance for what we’d assumed was a nasty flu or its annoying bacterial equivalent. We’d imagined a round of industrial-grade antibiotics, and then heading home in time for our 3-year-old’s usual bath-time routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the doctor’s face was serious. Machines beeped and whirred as my husband laid on the hospital bed. Whatever supernatural power colloquially known as a “gut feeling” flat-lined in my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s leukemia,” she said, putting a clinical end to what had been our honeymoon period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only six months earlier, a female Elvis impersonator had declared us husband and wife. A burlesque dancer pressed her cleavage into both of our faces as our friends cheered and threw dollar bills. A wedding in Vegas was my idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two years of dating Marty, a cute roller hockey player with an unwavering moral compass, I knew I wanted to have a child with him. It was marriage, not commitment, that unnerved me. I wanted romance, freedom and to do things my way. The word “wife” induced an allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Marty and I became parents and navigated adulthood together, my resistance to matrimony started to feel like an outdated quirk. The emotional equivalent of a person still rocking a septum piercing long after they stopped listening to punk music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marty had shown me, over and over, what it was to be a teammate. He’d rubbed my back through hours of labor, made late-night runs for infant Tylenol and was never afraid to cry at the sad parts of movies or take the occasional harsh piece of feedback about his communication style. And like all good teams, we kicked ass together. So why was I still resisting something that meant so much to him? To our family?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One random Saturday, at the Hawthorne In-N-Out Burger, after Marty ordered fries as a treat for our son, I finally said, “Screw it. Let’s get married.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wedding day was raucous and covered in glitter. We both wore white. Our son’s jacket had a roaring tiger stitched onto the back and was layered over his toddler-size tuxedo T-shirt. Loved ones from all over the country flew to meet us in a tiny pink chapel. A neon heart buzzed over our heads as we vowed to “love each other in sickness and in health, till death do us part.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t have imagined then that the next chapel I’d be in would be the hospital prayer room. Or that I would have begged a God I struggle to believe in to please spare Marty’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike our decision to marry, acute leukemia came on suddenly. Over the course of a few weeks, Marty’s bone marrow had flooded his blood with malignant cells. Treatment was urgent. He was taken by ambulance from the ER to the City of Hope hospital in Duarte, a part of Los Angeles County we’d never had a reason to visit before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally the 50th wedding anniversary is celebrated with gold, the 25th with silver and the first with paper. But we couldn’t even afford to look paper-far-ahead anymore. Instead, we celebrated that the specific genetic modifiers of Marty’s cancer were treatable, the good chemo days and his being able to walk to the hospital lobby to see our son for the first time in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leukemia has taught me things such as: how to inject antifungal medication into the open PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) line in Marty’s veins, how to explain to our son that “Papa will be sleeping with the doctors for a long while so they can help him feel better” and that to do the hibbity-dibbity with a person going through chemo, you must wear a condom. But mostly my husband’s sickness has taught me about healthy love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we had a child together, we’d committed to being in each other’s lives forever. But marriage was different. We’d already made a promise to our son, but when we got married, we made one to each other and ourselves. We had gone all in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since his diagnosis two months ago, there have been so many ways we’ve shown love for each other. People assume that I would do all the caregiving, but it’s more than that. Yes, I’ve washed my husband’s feet when he couldn’t bend down, been the only parent at preschool dropoff and pickup, and advocated on Marty’s behalf to his health insurance with only a few choice expletives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my husband has also taken care of me. Even when he was nauseous, sweating and fatigued, Marty showed up. He made me laugh with macabre jokes about how the only way for us to watch anything other than “PAW Patrol” on TV together was for him to get hospitalized. He insisted that I make time to rest and bring him the car owner’s manual, so he could figure out why the check engine light had come on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d promised in front of our closest friends and Elvis herself to love each other “for better or worse.” And when the worst arrived sooner than expected, we did more than love. We truly cared for each other as husband and wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The author is a writer whose short stories have been nominated for the PEN/Robert J.

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I ghosted one of my best friends from high school. I loved her like a sister, and we had a lot of fun, but she was a pathological liar and constantly needed attention. If I was talking about something important or serious or even telling a story, a lot of times she would steer the convo back to her. She would also make up stories to go along with the topic we’re talking about, which I began to notice when she started contradicting something she said previously or would make up details in stories where I was with her. Honestly, it was a bit exhausting, but she really was a good friend and wasn’t actively trying to be toxic."&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We grew apart in college, but still tried talking whenever we could. However, the final straw was when my mom passed away from cancer.

&lt;p&gt;A Chicago dog under observation for biting an individual tested positive for rabies, the state’s first confirmed canine case in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, the dog bit an individual on December 11, and was held in accordance with state law.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Due to the dog’s behavior, it was euthanized on December 18, and tested positive for rabies on December 19 at a Chicago laboratory, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the IDPH, the dog was the first in the state to test positive for rabies since 1994, and is the first to test positive in Cook County since at least 1964.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog had been vaccinated for rabies in June after it was adopted as part of a litter of puppies transported from a Florida rescue to Chicago in May of this year, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog had behavioral issues throughout its life, which became worse in December, including growling, snapping, increased barking and anxiety, according to the IDPH press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog had been vaccinated for rabies and rabies wasn’t initially suspected, but after the animal was euthanized it tested positive via direct fluorescent antibody testing last week.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;It is currently being investigated what strain of rabies the dog had been infected with, according to officials. Bats are the lone known reservoir for animal rabies in the state, with the last skunk known to have tested positive for the illness in 1998 and the last raccoon to test positive for rabies in 1983.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the dog was vaccinated, it is possible the animal was exposed to a rabid animal prior to that vaccination. The typical incubation period for rabies in dogs is 20-to-60 days, but symptoms can develop up to a year after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDPH and IDPH are evaluating people who were in contact with the dog to determine if rabies post-exposure treatment should be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any dog that is up-to-date on rabies vaccinations and was in contact with the rabid dog at a doggy day care it was housed at should get a booster shot, and should be quarantined at home for 45 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include restlessness, aggression, excessive slobbering, lethargy, weakness, hypersensitivity, and hydrophobia, according to IDPH.&lt;/p&gt;

"Simple actions like staying home when you're sick and calling ahead before seeking medical care help protect others, especially during a busy time of year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah has reported 125 measles cases statewide this year, as of Dec. 16, which is the most cases in a year in &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51418140" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;more than three decades&lt;/a&gt;, according to state epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen. An updated statewide count is expected to be released Tuesday at 3 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of Utah's confirmed cases are found in southwestern Utah, according to the state's &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, with a growing number reported in counties in northern Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can remain airborne and on surfaces for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area. Symptoms often include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications of the disease can lead to blindness and death for those with compromised immune systems, young children and adults over the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of the disease, and say that herd immunity requires a 95% vaccination rate. About 90% of Utahns are vaccinated against measles, according to Nolen and Dorothy Adams, a Salt Lake County health expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 2,000 cases of measles have been confirmed nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the highest number since the disease was considered &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51409430" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help prevent the spread of measles, Utah County health officials urge Utahns to take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home when sick, especially if a fever or rash is present.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call ahead before seeking medical care if measles is suspected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

So much flu,” said Dr. Debra Langlois, a pediatrician at University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital in Ann Arbor. “We are inundated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d9ef6" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. John Schieffelin, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, is also seeing a surge in bad cases, particularly among kids who haven’t had their flu shots.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16ddc1" class="body-graf"&gt;“The kids who are vaccinated are doing just fine” recovering at home, Schieffelin said. “It’s the unvaccinated children that we’re seeing in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-4d01b8" class="body-heading"&gt;Flu symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c63cd4" class="body-graf"&gt;Langlois said she and her colleagues are seeing a fair amount of classic flu symptoms: fevers, body aches and extreme fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f022d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Anecdotally, Langlois said that she’s also seeing kids with severe headaches and dizziness. Her 7-year-old daughter had the flu last week and described the feeling like this: “I feel dizzy, like I’m spinning when I’m trying to walk.” Dehydration was the likely cause, Langlois said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-298284" class="body-graf"&gt;Some kids may also experience gastrointestinal issues like vomiting and diarrhea. But those symptoms could also arise because of a secondary virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4e851" class="body-graf"&gt;Children who have “persistent” fevers lasting two to three days, Langlois said, should be seen by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ed5d3f" class="body-heading"&gt;Is Tamiflu available?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-65e4f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Pharmacies say demand for the antiviral drug Tamiflu is also increasing. When given within the first 24 hours or so of flu symptoms, the drug has been shown to make people feel better about a day earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-507073" class="body-graf"&gt;A Walgreens spokesperson said the pharmacy chain is seeing “very high demand” for Tamiflu nationwide. The company recently saw its supply run low but has since ordered additional stock, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59dc08" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the Walgreens Respiratory Index — a weekly online tool that tracks the spread of respiratory illnesses — demand for over-the-counter at-home flu tests has jumped 61% nationwide over the last two weeks. In New York state, where flu activity is considered very high, according to the CDC, week over week demand is up 23%, while the two week increase stands at 111%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ccfc4" class="body-graf"&gt;Antonio Ciaccia, president of 3 Axis Advisory, a consulting firm focused on addressing supply chain issues, said he’s hearing from a number of independent pharmacies across the U.S. who say they’re struggling to meet demand for Tamiflu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6986a3" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are seeing an early heavy wave of flu cases, which is likely pushing a bit of unexpected pressure on the broader drug distribution channel and its supply,” Ciaccia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8566bb" class="body-graf"&gt;Steve Moore, who runs an independent pharmacy in Plattsburgh, New York, said his primary supplier is not experiencing shortages of Tamiflu. His backup supplier, however, is currently out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4b55a" class="body-graf"&gt;While Tamiflu can be helpful, Langlois said it’s no “miracle cure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-05cdca" class="body-graf"&gt;The antiviral is authorized for people 2 weeks and older, and is generally &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bad-flu-cdc-reports-us-high-high-flu-levels-rcna57849" target="_blank"&gt;most effective&lt;/a&gt; when given within the first 48 hours of flu symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aab29c" class="body-graf"&gt;“The thing to think about for Tamiflu is that it shortens the duration of symptoms by about a day,” Langlois said. “It’s really best reserved for high-risk patients, like patients with chronic lung disease, and young kiddos under age 2.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e6d25d" class="body-heading"&gt;If you're sick, stay home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e447bb" class="body-graf"&gt;“The best thing is prevention,” Langlois said, “and that’s getting your flu shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4cbbb2" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC recommends annual flu vaccines for everyone 6 months and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-550c9f" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors worry that kids who are sick with flu now could spread it to grandparents and other older adults over the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11c08f" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“At the risk of being a Grinch, if you have the flu and you actively have fevers, then you should stay home. Don’t go to family gatherings,” said Dr. Bernard Camins, medical director for infection prevention for Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. “People will understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:22:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOODA1cmhsbkpYcVZ4eWZWekI0VmR5SWZ1M2owTmVZUzl2TmNoMEdTWnI1TVIzQkQ1ZnlOS3JHN3BBcVR1Vk9BNGRTR01YYUp5ZVoydVl5d1kxcTViR1Q4Umx4aHlXU0hqX0xiN0dXRUpPZGQzZmtldmdJUTZlREFxUk92Zm9TRmlzZUZ3SWsydUVidWp2bmwyQTJTSkxtSUQwaFdKY2Y3RmprSndadnFjUmhvUnBfTFlnVnfSAVZBVV95cUxPNERRTjVQOG9qa1ZTb3RPdFM4Z2JRYWJnaXZKVmlycENsamFzWmk4ZjZ2LWIxLWQ5R1M4Nk9mUXN4cDBROXdfWnF4N0UwbUo5WkRRQy1tQQ</guid></item><item><title>诺如病毒须知：症状、传播等-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/22/well/norovirus-symptoms-precautions.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 21:44:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPb2tQMS04X2FMakRuWnM5VVBOajJfQ2FYUFlKV2NVQS1od1Rpdy03VjJ4elNlVTN2dnNmMmY4QUNTd1ZRaHhHZkRMellUeEFIWEJoWnFxNzNCZmZ4S1k5cUNmSmNZVklTOTZkaGF4a05WbEZmblcwMjRGSHhXRC1RMw</guid></item><item><title>随着马拉佐准备在IDSA掌舵，科学界称赞选择- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/marrazzo-prepares-helm-idsa-scientific-community-praises-choice</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has tapped Jeanne Marrazzo, MD, MPH, as its next chief executive officer (CEO), which some observers in the scientific community hail as a bold move that signals the society’s willingness to push back against the Trump administration’s perceived attempts to muzzle academics and health professionals who defy it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Her appointment marks a pivotal moment for IDSA as the field continues to face rapidly evolving challenges, emerging pathogens and increasing demands on the nation’s health system infrastructure,” IDSA said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/idsa-selects-next-ceo/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;news release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; late last week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marrazzo ‘superb choice’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marrazzo, who begins her IDSA tenure on January 12, was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/infectious-disease-expert-jeanne-marrazzo-replace-fauci-niaid-director"&gt;&lt;span&gt;director&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) until she was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/public-health/former-nih-officials-file-whistleblower-complaint"&gt;&lt;span&gt;fired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; earlier this year because of what she said was speaking out against risky public health policies.

&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Directions in Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt; has revealed that &lt;strong&gt;mitochondria&lt;/strong&gt;, the tiny energy factories inside brain cells, may be the missing link between stress, trauma, and mental health. These microscopic powerhouses not only generate energy but also seem to translate emotional experiences into biological changes that shape how we feel and think.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mitochondria: The Hidden Translators Of Stress&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, researchers have understood that experiences such as &lt;strong&gt;chronic stress&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;loneliness&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;trauma&lt;/strong&gt; can alter &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/brain-mechanisms-voice-recognition-species/" data-type="post" data-id="88162"&gt;brain &lt;/a&gt;function. What remained unclear was how these external pressures become internal biological reactions. According to &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Fagundes&lt;/strong&gt;, professor of psychological sciences at &lt;strong&gt;Rice University&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “We actually have biomarkers that really are showing links between psychological processes and people’s physiology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the center of this biological bridge are &lt;strong&gt;mitochondria&lt;/strong&gt;, often called the “engines” of our cells. They not only produce &lt;strong&gt;ATP&lt;/strong&gt;—the body’s primary energy currency—but also help regulate immune responses, inflammation, and neural signaling. When exposed to prolonged stress, mitochondria lose efficiency, impairing energy flow throughout the brain and body. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The actual cellular machinery that links these experiences to disease really starts at the level of the mitochondria,” said Fagundes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means the same organelles that fuel thought and emotion may also determine how psychological wounds manifest as physical illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Mental Health Depends On Cellular Energy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The human brain consumes an extraordinary share of the body’s energy. Every thought, memory, or emotional reaction depends on seamless mitochondrial performance. When these organelles falter, neural transmission slows, synaptic flexibility declines, and mood regulation suffers. Variations in mitochondrial DNA have been tied to heightened risks for &lt;strong&gt;anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;depression&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now recognizing that even subtle mitochondrial changes can set off cascades of dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of the relationships that we’ve been thinking of – [between] inflammatory processes and these kinds of mental health outcomes – we should look toward alterations in mitochondria being a real mediator or [underlying] mechanism,” Fagundes explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Stress And Isolation Rewrite The Body’s Energy Code&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress doesn’t merely affect mood—it reshapes metabolism. Over time, stress pushes mitochondria into an inefficient state, producing fewer energy molecules and more inflammatory signals. This biological imbalance can feel like &lt;strong&gt;fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;brain fog&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;emotional instability&lt;/strong&gt;. The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214251380214" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Current Directions in Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,  emphasizes that mitochondria sit at the center of these pathways, bridging mental distress and physical health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fagundes also highlighted the toll of &lt;strong&gt;social isolation&lt;/strong&gt; on mitochondrial vitality. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people are lonely and socially isolated, a lot of times there seems to be this loop where they have more anxiety to go out of the house,” he noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is a recipe for negative alterations in the mitochondria, less energy, less resources to expend. So, when one does try to break that cycle, it’s much more difficult.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This vicious feedback loop between energy depletion and emotional withdrawal underscores how biology and behavior intertwine in mental health struggles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Restoring The Brain’s Cellular Resilience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, mitochondria are remarkably adaptable. Lifestyle changes and therapeutic interventions can restore their efficiency and even increase their number. &lt;strong&gt;Aerobic exercise&lt;/strong&gt;, for instance, boosts mitochondrial enzyme activity and promotes biogenesis, the creation of new mitochondria. These changes enhance neural communication and mood stability, providing a biological explanation for why regular movement improves mental health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early findings suggest that &lt;strong&gt;mindfulness practices&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;psychotherapy&lt;/strong&gt; may also strengthen mitochondrial performance. Studies show that trauma-focused therapy for &lt;strong&gt;PTSD&lt;/strong&gt; can increase mitochondrial density, even if symptom relief takes time to follow. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been talking a lot about things like inflammation. It tells us something is happening, but mitochondria help us explain why it’s happening at the cellular level,” Fagundes said. “If we focus more at the cellular level, we’ll have a much deeper understanding of underlying processes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;A smart watch may be under your Christmas tree this week. The nifty gadgets are advertised as a tool to help you stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But can smart watches be trusted to look out for your heart? A Maryland cardiologist said the tech can monitor heart rate variability, absolute heart rate and its trends as well as heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Smart watches are fantastic screening tools, but they are not diagnostic tools,” said Dr. Minhal Makshood, a cardiologist with MedStar Montgomery Medical Center. “Ultimately, they cannot substitute your physician.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The watches can screen for changes in heart patterns that don’t always present symptoms right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’re great for noticing trends,” she said. “And then bringing that data, if there’s any abnormality, to your doctor for clear diagnosis, because they are not ultimately, medical grade devices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some changes could warrant a visit to your doctor, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If your smart watch is telling you that at rest, your heart rate is increasing,” Makshood said. “If there is abnormal response to exercise, or even if it’s flagging irregular heart rhythm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The watches could make a great gift for people who have heart disease, high blood pressure or loved ones with risk factors for heart disease such as diabetes, high cholesterol or sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Those patients are at risk of developing things like atrial fibrillation,” she said. “That’s an abnormal heart rhythm that is pretty common and when untreated, can lead to blood clot formation and increased risk of stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the smart watches have some shortfalls. Makshood said certain data collected by the tech could be inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You need to understand caveats, like blood pressure assessment, oxygen saturation may not always be accurate,” she said. “You can get false alarms depending on motion, depending on skin contact during exercise, all these are sensitive to the changes that you see in your watch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when shopping for a smart watch, there are certain data points the devices measure that are more helpful than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If the watch specifically tells you your heart rate, heart rate trends, if it tells you about heart rate variability, response to sleep and exercise,” Makshood said. “And if it helps tracking the heart rhythm with a single lead ECG, which the Apple Watch allows. That is really useful information.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple Watch was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the detection of atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;

"It makes elimination more realistically achievable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gumel and his team's simulations suggest that if South Korea's HPV vaccination program were expanded to include boys, the nation could eliminate HPV-related cancers in about 70 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186065" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186065" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/park_12.05.2025-642x361.png" alt="Eliminating Cervical Cancer " class="size-medium wp-image-186065" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/park_12.05.2025-642x361.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/park_12.05.2025-1200x675.png 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/park_12.05.2025-768x432.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/park_12.05.2025-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/park_12.05.2025-600x338.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/park_12.05.2025.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186065" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers modeled different HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening strategies in South Korea.

It is behind virtually every case of cervical cancer, which kills more than 300,000 people globally each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first HPV vaccine was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.03.001"&gt;licensed in 2006&lt;/a&gt;, and it was initially rolled out to protect people from dangerous strains of HPV that can lead to cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, pharmaceutical companies marketed the vaccination as a preventative medicine specifically for women, and sure enough, the vaccine has proved &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/young-american-deaths-from-cervical-cancer-fall-sharply-after-hpv-vaccine"&gt;incredibly effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing cervical cancer. In the past two decades, cervical cancer cases have dropped by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cervical-cancer-cases-in-the-uk-have-plummeted-since-hpv-vaccines-were-introduced"&gt;almost 90 percent&lt;/a&gt; in some regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are still more lives to save, men included. The persistent '&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303122"&gt;gender bias&lt;/a&gt;' in HPV vaccination policies and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1525547"&gt;public health messaging&lt;/a&gt; needs to be addressed for further gains, some researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, scientists know that both men and women are at risk from HPV-linked cancers, including anal, penile, vaginal, and head and neck cancers. Yet in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/teenage-boys-in-the-uk-will-also-be-vaccinated-against-cancer-causing-hpv"&gt;many nations&lt;/a&gt; around the world, far fewer young men are getting their jabs – a massive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-s-a-massive-sex-discrepancy-in-who-is-getting-the-hpv-vaccine"&gt;sex discrepancy&lt;/a&gt; that public health advisors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines12101110"&gt;want to fix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, for instance, the new model found that the nation is unlikely to eliminate cervical cancer unless more boys get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to simulations, 99 percent of all young women would need to be immunized under the nation's current vaccination program to achieve herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, the percentage of young women vaccinated is at 88 percent, which means HPV and related cancers can still persist in the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that could change, however, if boys got vaccinated, too. If 65 percent of males in the nation were vaccinated, and current female rates hold steady, the new models show that South Korea could reach herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If vaccination coverage among females were to drop slightly to 80 percent, the elimination of cervical cancer could still be achieved in South Korea if 80 percent of males were also immunized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past 20 years, South Korea's cases of HPV-related male cancer have tripled. If more boys get vaccinated, it could prevent future deaths from these cancers as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186067" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186067" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/MaleVaccination-642x210.png" alt="Eliminating Cervical Cancer Depends on Boys Getting The Vaccine, Too" class="wp-image-186067 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/MaleVaccination-642x210.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/MaleVaccination-1200x393.png 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/MaleVaccination-768x251.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/MaleVaccination-1536x503.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/MaleVaccination-2048x670.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/MaleVaccination-600x196.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186067" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Modeling showed that vaccinating more boys in South Korea could reduce the cumulative (a) cervical cancer cases in females, (b) cervical cancer-induced deaths in females, and (c) HPV-related cancer cases in males, by 2080.

                &lt;p&gt;Vaccines are in more danger than ever before. Over the weekend, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nearly succeeded at shrinking down the childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Politico &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/20/rfk-kennedy-danish-vaccine-schedule-denmark-00701999"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Kennedy canceled a press conference set for Friday afternoon where he would have formally advised that parents follow the vaccine schedule implemented in Denmark—a system with several fewer vaccine recommendations. Experts have largely opposed the proposed change, noting that the two countries are vastly different from each other. RFK Jr. reportedly balked at the last second due to concerns the decision would face political and legal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A near miss&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. and his allies have been signaling this potential change for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the last meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in early December, Tracy Beth Høeg, acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), gave a presentation about Denmark’s vaccine schedule. Høeg and others have argued that the U.S. should consider adopting Denmark’s schedule. Denmark universally recommends childhood vaccines for &lt;a href="https://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Scheduler/ByCountry?SelectedCountryId=58&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=false&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=false"&gt;10 diseases&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the U.S. universally recommends vaccines for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html"&gt;16 diseases&lt;/a&gt; (that number was 17 until the recent ACIP-led change to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/we-are-doing-harm-rfk-jr-s-acip-guts-universal-hep-b-vaccination-at-birth-2000695747"&gt;revoke&lt;/a&gt; its recommendation for the hepatitis B vaccine).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after, President Donald Trump stated that he would push to change the U.S. vaccine schedule to match that of other “peer countries” and &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-begins-process-to-align-u-s-core-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-with-best-practices-from-peer-developed-countries/"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an executive order on December 5 to that effect. This set the stage for HHS last Thursday to announce a press conference for the next day, where RFK Jr. was expected to officially recommend the Danish vaccine schedule as an alternative for parents in the U.S. to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But it seems the administration grew cold feet mere hours after it announced the press conference. An anonymous senior HHS official told Politico that the HHS Office of the General Counsel deemed that the abrupt change would likely result in a successful lawsuit against the agency. A second official added that the decision would be “politically risky.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An HHS spokesperson told Gizmodo that any reasons for the press conference’s cancellation not provided by HHS are “pure speculation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A lack of reason&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be clear, Kennedy and others have never presented a reasonable case for such a sweeping change to the vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There is no credible evidence that the amount or timing of vaccines currently recommended in the U.S. poses a health risk to children—a reality &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/multiples.html#:~:text=Scientific%20data%20show,vaccines%20on%20time."&gt;still acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (for now). Some anti-vaccination proponents have also argued that specific ingredients commonly included in vaccines, such as aluminum, could be dangerous if given repeatedly, but the majority of studies have not found any such risk, including one &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; just this past summer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts have also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/19/denmark-vaccine-schedule-vs-us/"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that while Denmark does recommend fewer vaccines in general than the U.S., there are important reasons why this schedule isn’t easily transferable to the latter. For one, Denmark has a universal health care system that’s much more robust than the U.S.’s fragmented system. This includes improved screening for vaccine-preventable diseases like hepatitis B. Notably, the U.S. once tried to vaccinate only high-risk groups for hepatitis B but eventually switched to a universal system after cases failed to significantly decline; this approach then helped dramatically reduce new infections, particularly among newborns.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leaving that aside, plenty of other high-income countries are much closer to the U.S. in the number of vaccines they recommend to their residents, including &lt;a href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/182063328?r=1qy0gl&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true#:~:text=Canada%2C%20Australia%2C%20Germany%2C%20France%2C%20and%20Japan%20all%20have%20schedules%20covering%2014%2D16%20diseases"&gt;Canada, Germany, and Japan&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few. Some countries are also following the U.S.’s example and adding more vaccines to their schedule, such as the U.K., which will &lt;a href="https://www.gov.wales/routine-varicella-chickenpox-vaccination-young-children-1-january-2026-whc2025046-html#:~:text=The%20NHS%20in%20Wales%20will%20introduce%20a,One%20dose%20of%20MMRV%20at%20this%20appointment"&gt;introduce&lt;/a&gt; the chickenpox vaccine to its routine starting next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even health officials in Denmark are baffled by the attempt to use the country as justification for Kennedy’s trimming of the U.S. schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It’s not at all fair to say look at Denmark unless you can match the other characteristics of Denmark,” Anders Hviid, the lead researcher on vaccine safety and effectiveness at the Statens Serum Institut (Denmark’s equivalent to the CDC), &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/19/health/kennedy-childhood-vaccine-schedule-denmark.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the New York Times Friday. “It is surreal, and it is difficult, from a Danish perspective, to understand what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s certainly possible that some vaccines aren’t or will eventually not be worthwhile for children in the U.S. to routinely receive. But any changes should be carefully weighed and discussed by actual health experts and researchers, not abruptly implemented under the radar on a Friday afternoon by politicians who have a clear anti-vaccine bias like RFK Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Doctors and scientists say this year's influenza season could be tougher than usual. A new version of the flu virus, called H3N2, is spreading quickly. At the same time, fewer people are getting &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kids-flu-covid-shots-fall-2025-vaccine-guidance-shifts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;flu shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This flu season is no joke. We are seeing more cases than we would expect for this time of year," Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, said on "CBS Mornings." Specifically, she explained, "we are seeing influenza A, and within influenza A we are seeing a subtype or variant called H3N2."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's pretty likely to be an H3N2-dominated flu season," said Jesse Bloom, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who studies viral evolution. "I don't see any reason to think that this is an unprecedentedly bad one, but current indicators are that it may be substantially more severe than the typical winter flu season."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloom said the H3N2 virus has changed just enough to make it harder for people's immune systems to recognize, but a flu shot could still help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting the vaccine is something that people, particularly those who are in high-risk groups, can do," he explained. "It's not going to eliminate their chance of getting infected, but it does mitigate their risk."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A changing virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other experts share Bloom's concern. "I would say pretty worried," said Dr. Helen Chu, a flu expert at the University of Washington. "Based on the U.K. and Japan data, it's looking like it's causing a lot of cases of flu and hospitalizations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said flu activity "is starting everywhere right now," overlapping with RSV but coming before a likely winter COVID-19 wave. &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Early flu vaccine data from other countries&lt;/a&gt; show good protection at first, around 70% in children, but that may not last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Total season effectiveness is probably going to actually be much, much lower," Chu warned, because immunity fades over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trevor Bedford, who also studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, said H3N2 tends to evolve faster than other influenza strains. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I expect more H3 incidence than the typical year and poorer vaccine effectiveness," he said. These large "jumps" in how the virus appears to our immune system usually occur every three to four years, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/stephen-s-morse-phd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Stephen Morse&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University, noted that influenza's behavior still defies confident forecasting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many excellent scientists have come to grief trying to predict what influenza will do — consider 1976," he said, referring to a year with a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2686218/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;notorious scare&lt;/a&gt; over a swine flu outbreak that didn't end up spreading widely. He added that the emergence of the H3N2 K subclade was "one of those surprises," and while surveillance detected it quickly, "the bad news is that we weren't really prepared for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why that matters: H3N2 is known for causing tougher flu seasons, especially for seniors. The new strain has changed in ways that make it harder for the immune system to recognize, so more people may get sick and need hospital care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The flu vaccine still helps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with these changes, doctors say the annual flu shot is still the best protection available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The match to H1N1 and flu B is expected to be good," said Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. "Even though we are expecting a H3N2 mismatch, vaccine effectiveness doesn't always correlate with vaccine match. … Bottom line, still a good idea to get the vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early-season data from the U.K. suggest the flu vaccine is still helping prevent severe illness, especially in children, even with the H3N2 mismatch. Protection in adults appears more modest and is expected to decline over time. Experts stress that flu vaccines are designed mainly to reduce severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths — not necessarily to prevent every infection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gregory Gray, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Texas Medical Branch, added that people who work with animals should also be vaccinated. "Persons working with cattle, poultry, and pigs should receive their annual influenza vaccine," he said. That helps stop human viruses from mixing with animal ones and creating new strains that could be dangerous to both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morse also underscored the value of vaccination despite the virus's unpredictability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I still advocate the annual influenza vaccine… It's still a good precaution," he said, pointing out that flu shots help protect against multiple circulating viruses, not just H3N2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flu symptoms to watch for, and what you can do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates there have been 4.6 million flu cases across the U.S. since this season began, and 1,900 patients have died from it, including at least three children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are tons of these cases throughout the country, and it's causing a very, very severe flu," Kravitz said. "Symptoms that are very intense, they come on really, really rapidly. It's very contagious, so it is spreading quickly through communities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu is often accompanied by "high, high fevers, like 103, 104 degrees Fahrenheit," as well as body aches and cough, Kravitz said. In addition, she added, "we see vomiting in children this year, specifically with this variant of the flu."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advised parents to help keep their child hydrated, and "if the symptoms last a long time, more than four or five days, especially that high fever, it's a good idea to call their pediatrician."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say there's no need to panic, but it's important to prepare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get your vaccine," Chu said. "It's still not too late." The shot helps protect against severe illness and may even give "some cross protection against H5N1 as well," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors also stress the importance of early testing and treatment. Antiviral medications like Tamiflu and Xofluza still work against the flu strains circulating this season, including H3N2, but they work best when started within the first couple of days of symptoms — especially for older adults, young children, pregnant people, and those with chronic health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray said the country needs better flu testing and more vaccines for humans and livestock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webby summed it up simply: "It's more of the same: vaccination, hygiene, and keeping an eye out for anything unusual."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bird flu still rare, but worth watching&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first human case of a bird flu strain, H5N5, was recently reported &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/washington-resident-dies-rare-bird-flu-strain/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;in Washington state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It has not spread to others, but scientists are watching closely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk to the general public from the H5N1 virus is still very low," Webby said. "But an H5 pandemic could easily make the COVID-19 pandemic look like a cake walk."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc6" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",6]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chu said fall bird migrations make this the time of year when cases in birds, and sometimes in people, tend to rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the time of year when we see the H5 cases," she said. "But a lot of the surveillance programs have been defunded, so in Washington state, there's not been as much as in years past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morse warned that gaps in surveillance, especially in agriculture, leave room for dangerous blind spots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance is still crucial. It needs to be sustained. … Agriculture especially has to do much more," he said, noting that past outbreaks in pigs and cattle were missed until they were well underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say avian flu remains a low risk for most people right now, but it is a low-probability, high-impact threat that requires close monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

According to research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10699709/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Infectious Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Infectious Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, an unbalanced microbiome (aka dysbiosis of the gut microbiota) has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a64770566/how-to-thrive-with-type-2-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, non-alcoholic liver disease, cardiometabolic diseases, cancer, arthritis, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65597974/surprising-symptoms-of-depression/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:depression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, sleep disorders, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a69190458/high-blood-pressure-causes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hypertension;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the ways that your microbiome impacts your overall health, Dr. Dibba explains that health problems that start in your gut, such as digestive issues or bowel diseases, can ultimately lead to more serious conditions if left unaddressed. “Bleeding ulcers, for example, can lead to anemia, which can result in fatigue and cardiac symptoms. Untreated inflammatory bowel disease can result in colon cancer,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs of an unhealthy gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the health of your gut is linked to many different symptoms, most of the early signs that your gut health is out of whack are digestive in nature. According to Dr. Dibba, these may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, an unhealthy gut may also present in other ways that you may not immediately associate with the area of your body. “An unhealthy gut can also result in neurologic manifestations, cardiac manifestations, and systemic symptoms,” says Dr. Dibba. Per Bakovic and Dr. Dibba, these may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While problems with your gut health may manifest as digestive problems like gas, bloating, or changes in your bowel movements, they can also present in seemingly unconnected ways. If you start to experience anything out of the ordinary, especially if you are also having digestive issues, it’s smart to give your healthcare provider a call to figure out how to treat any underlying issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:34:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPNy15SUZJdUQ2bUhPUGlRVnBPQlpBM0tmVnpuMEloZmNzRWRhdHF5LXZHTlJ2TUp4VnNRR2k2cy04ekpIM1R2dTZDMHhEQVhzV1lkTGhXanlpYlNrblVQV3l2MzY2RGtYQzl2UDBLTlhOVXI5dkxZQkR4Q0YzTkw4emx2VnhVWlU</guid></item><item><title>考古学家发现了著名“骑士”的尸体，解开了300年前的谜团-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/archaeologists-identified-body-famed-horseman-160800387.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Following a 2019 fire at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, archaeological restoration work uncovered 100 unknown burials under the cathedral, including a mysterious lead coffin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;French researchers believe they found the remains of famed French Renaissance poet Joachim du Bellay, who died in 1560.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The remains were nicknamed “The Horseman” upon discovery in 2022 because bone structure showed the man had ridden horses since a young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is a collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.biography.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Biography.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Biography.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since 1560, nobody was quite sure where the final remains of famed French Renaissance poet Joachim du Bellay wound up. They were believed to be alongside his uncle somewhere under the &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/a27633796/notre-dame-restoration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris&lt;/a&gt;, but when archaeologists went looking in 1758, the poet (or what was left of him) was nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then came another mystery. In 2022, archaeologists discovered an unmarked body under the famous cathedral and nicknamed it “The Horseman,” because the deceased’s bone structure showed he had ridden horses from a young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, experts believe the body is one answer to &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; mysteries, identifying The Horseman as du Bellay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The French National Institute of Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) &lt;a href="https://www.inrap.fr/archeologie-de-notre-dame-de-paris-avancees-des-recherches-19536" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:announced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in a translated statement the discovery after more than two years of uncertainty surrounding the unidentified remains. The mystery all started with the &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a27153194/notre-dame-cathedral-fire/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:April 2019 fire at Notre Dame;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;April 2019 fire at Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;. As INRAP began to work on &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a33298872/notre-dame-fire-collapsed-spire-reconstruction/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the restoration of the cathedral;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the restoration of the cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, archaeologists discovered 100 unknown burials under Notre Dame. With thousands of people, typically church-goers, buried in what was &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/a31081400/human-leg-bone-wall/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a necropolis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a necropolis&lt;/a&gt; between the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, Notre Dame stands apart from other Catholic burial grounds because the cathedral is largely built atop the cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finding 100 sets of unidentified remains wasn’t all that surprising. But two stood out. Discovered in April 2022, they had been placed in lead &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a61678257/2000-year-old-sarcophagus-unsealed/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sarcophagi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sarcophagi&lt;/a&gt;—rather than the usual wooden coffins—and buried at the cathedral’s transept crossing, a prominent spot where its main wings intersect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the lead coffins didn’t provide much mystery, with a plaque epitaph labeling it as that of priest Antoine de la Porte, who died in 1710 after 50 years of service at Notre Dame. The other, though, sparked the two-year search for The Horseman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A forensic team from Toulouse University Hospital studied the remains, and according to Eric Crubezy—a biological anthropology professor and research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research—the anonymous individual died in his 30s from chronic tuberculous meningitis in the 16th century. That age was unusual for burials at Notre Dame, which typically held elderly men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even more intriguing: Aside from Antoine de la Porte, archaeologists didn’t find any other intact tombs in the area. “Research suggests that they may have reoccupied a grave that had housed two people well known in their time,” Crubezy said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers turned their focus toward du Bellay: horseback rider, tuberculosis sufferer, and poet who died in 1560. While he was believed to be buried in the cathedral, his tomb wasn’t found in 1758 near his uncle, even though the family wanted him to be buried by his side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, was du Balley The Horseman? “He matches all the criteria of the portrait,” Crubezy said at a news conference, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finternational.la-croix.com%2Fculture%2Fhave-archaeologists-found-poet-joachim-du-bellays-remains-at-notre-dame-cathedral&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Farchaeology%2Fa69838803%2Fnotre-dame-the-horseman-body-mystery-solved%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;La Croix&lt;/em&gt;. “He is an accomplished horseman, suffers from both conditions mentioned in some of his poems, like in ‘La Complainte du desespere,’ where he describes ‘this storm that blurs [his] mind,’ and his family belonged to the royal court and the pope’s close entourage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But there’s still a wrinkle to the mystery. Christophe Besnier, an INRAP archaeologist, said at the same press conference that the man buried likely grew up in Paris or Lyon thanks to an isotope analysis of teeth and bones. Balley was likely born in Anjou in western France and later moved to Paris, dying in 1560 around the age of 35. That would make The Horseman and du Balley a tough match. But one dissent isn’t enough to dissuade everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“What more can we have?” INRAP president Dominique Garcia &lt;a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/culture/article/2024/09/18/french-renaissance-poet-joachim-du-bellay-identified-in-coffin-found-at-notre-dame_6726412_30.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt;. “Find [du Bellay’s] toothbrush to check that the DNA matches? His age and pathology alone offer remarkable statistical solidity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPRzZCNjNYQktGV2NxTk01RVZUbm1xdG4wUUVIQlJyRERFUjhydURjMlFiUi1hZEItR0NQbVMyU0loOGMyeF9TU3JzanpwczJJOVNHX24tRWpEd2VFQ0VvQWhnNm5pSnlzOHBWQklqSzdjVFU1ZXFlX241a2E4STZiWUVnS09BMWNGQ1IyaklRdy1wZEsybUNwM2xmS0g</guid></item><item><title>麻省理工学院揭示了高脂饮食如何安静地灌注肝脏用于癌症- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/mit-reveals-how-high-fat-diets-quietly-prime-the-liver-for-cancer/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:00:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOSE5nTzVqamt2ZTNnUG5uYld5cnItUXR0VHc2N0pGUEFhX3A2WEVOTHUwN1BfVUJiUWwzUWhQMDM1YnhPQ1VnOU1SaVBZLV8zMi1tM0hXVkRTMEx1a3BUbVFNY1BkWDFfaDJYV3lhUjY0Ulk0LS04NTRiMU10QjkzcWlLcnFKTTVWQmFVekpNTWc5SFRuM1E</guid></item><item><title>神经科学研究员：我用来开启一天美好心情的增强多巴胺早晨活动- CNBC</title><link>https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/22/neuroscience-researcher-my-top-dopamine-boosting-morning-routine.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleBody-styles-makeit-articleBody--AEqcE" id="MakeItRegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-1" data-analytics="MakeItRegularArticle-articleBody-5-1"&gt;&lt;span class="HighlightShare-styles-makeit-hidden--MFwCR"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often underestimate how much our &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/arthur-brooks-leading-happiness-experts-6-step-morning-routine.html"&gt;morning rituals&lt;/a&gt; can set the tone for the rest of the day. When you prioritize activities that spark a natural dopamine release, you aren't just waking up — you're essentially giving your brain a head start on feeling motivated and balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical released by brain cells, and it's mostly involved in motivation, learning and reinforcement," says &lt;a href="https://www.miasoviero.com/about" target="_blank"&gt;Mia Soviero&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscience researcher who conducted research at&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;NYU Langone Health and Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It isn't just about feeling good. It's mostly about learning and motivating you. So, it helps our brain understand what actions are worth repeating and what habits we should have in our lives that we should strengthen," says Soviero, who also founded the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.miasoviero.com/entrepreneurship" target="_blank"&gt;Research Girl, Inc&lt;/a&gt; to help aspiring science researchers receive more opportunities in their field of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common misconception is that dopamine levels are always supposed to be boosted, Soviero says: Neurotransmitter levels are meant to fluctuate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want to always have really high dopamine levels, but we do want to have a healthy dopamine system," she says. "You just want to build these good patterns in dopamine, where dopamine is able to be released the way it's supposed to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how Soviero structures her mornings to keep her dopamine system healthy, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-styles-makeit-subtitle--JP3GH"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A neuroscience researcher's dopamine-boosting morning routine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Exposure to sunlight&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soviero's ideal morning routine for the best mood starts the night before: &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/15/3-habits-to-improve-your-quality-of-sleep.html"&gt;Getting adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt; sets the tone for the next day, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, "I make sure that when I wake up, I get exposure to some light in the morning," she says. "Opening your curtains in the morning and getting sunlight on your face for a few minutes have actually been scientifically proven to reduce depressive symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/shining-a-light-on-winter-depression" target="_blank"&gt;especially if you have seasonal depression&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunlight exposure directly affects the area of your brain that controls your body's internal clock, or your circadian rhythm, according to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/shining-a-light-on-winter-depression" target="_blank"&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting enough exposure to sunlight each day "can cause your brain to produce too much of the sleep hormone melatonin and to release less serotonin, the feel-good brain chemical that affects mood. The result of this chemical imbalance? You feel low and lethargic," the health blog states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Sudoku&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soviero makes time in her mornings to do "small, meaningful activities" like completing a daily Sudoku puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a great way to kick off the day with a little dopamine from doing a puzzle. It's that feel-good chemical from achieving [it]," she says. "Novelty and new things that you aren't expecting that are good can increase dopamine levels in the brain and contribute to dopamine health. So that's why puzzles are great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solving crossword puzzles and physical puzzles can have the same effects on your brain, Soviero says: &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine" target="_blank"&gt;The brain has a reward system that boosts dopamine&lt;/a&gt; when "something unexpectedly good happens, and then decreases when something worse than expected happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This means that evolutionarily, we would strive for goals in the hopes that we'd get this feel good chemical as a reward," she says. "So when you do something, [like] learning a new skill, and you're surprisingly good at it, you get this influx of dopamine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Text a friend&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each morning, Soviero practices a simple and significant form of social connection: texting a friend. "I'll send a text to my friends [like], 'Hey, good morning. How are you doing today?'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Humans are biologically wired for connections," Soviero adds. "When you get to make that human connection, it's scientifically proven to boost your mood because that's what we're supposed to be doing." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending too much time without interacting with close loved ones like friends and family can harm your health, she says. Being socially isolated and feeling lonely can increase a person's risk of developing heart disease, dementia, depression and other chronic conditions, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/social-connectedness/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecting with others is "really healthy, not only for your brain but also for your body," Soviero says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?&lt;/strong&gt; Sign up for CNBC's new online course, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-raise-financially-smart-kids?utm_source=cnbc&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=bottom" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Raise Financially Smart Kids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

A few years earlier, at the age of 34, soon after he and his wife had had their third child, Adam was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. I saw the story as a way to write about how people with fatal diagnoses navigate decisions on how to spend their remaining time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam died over the weekend, at 43. He and his family — his wife Whitney, and their three sons, Isaac, Noah, and Gideon, now 14, 12, and 10 — lived with his illness for nine years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam and Whitney had always been clear-eyed about the future and the ultimate course of his disease. So when he &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/9hbg2-help-for-the-haydens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;entered hospice care at home&lt;/a&gt; in the Indianapolis suburbs last month, I proposed writing another story about him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be illuminating to hear what he had learned about medicine through years of being a patient — where the system was built well, and where it fell short. I was interested not only in his experience of facing the kind of daily grind that comes with a cancer diagnosis, but the familial and financial challenges as well. But there was a selfish reason for my interest, too. Adam and I had kept in touch over the years, catching up every few months. I liked talking to him, and wanted to have more conversations with him. I knew I’d also get to talk more with Whitney, who is a riot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam was thoughtful, warm, and curious, a guy whose kindergarten teacher had once told his parents he had “a very gentle psyche.” He was also very public about his own journey as a patient. He &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/02/27/expert-patients-cancer-compensation/"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; compelling &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/02/long-term-survivors-can-help-map-cancer-boundaries/"&gt;op-eds&lt;/a&gt;, including for &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/26/john-mccain-glioblastoma-advice/"&gt;STAT&lt;/a&gt;, about his experience with cancer. He had trained as a philosopher and had dreams of becoming an academic. He didn’t need an outside writer to invoke the sword of Damocles that had been looming over him all these years. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Adam seemed excited about another story. (“I’ll always yap,” he said.) And Adam, who had devoted himself to advocacy on behalf of people with brain tumors and who confronted his disease with an openness and vulnerability that made people feel so connected to him, knew that dying was a part of this condition. He wanted to be upfront about that as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve taken a bad situation and done good things with it,” he told me. “That’s the most enduring thing I’ve been feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was on Nov. 20. He had just had his first appointment with the home health aide as part of his hospice care. It was nice to have more help at the house so Whitney had to bear less of it, he said. His beard had recently been bordering on biblical proportions, so the aide had given him a beard wash. That was nice, too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Adam admitted that, even though he had thought about the end for so long and prepared for it, getting to this point was surreal. It felt like his body was giving out faster than his mind was, or was ready for. He had been losing more motor control on one side of his body, and it was difficult and frustrating to try to type with one hand at a time when he had so much he wanted to get out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a lot of adjustment in a hurry,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That sword, he added, had dropped.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam and I had planned to keep chatting for the follow-up story, but soon after we spoke that day in November, his condition started deteriorating. A series of seizures left him confused, less able to speak, and in need of more sleep. We weren’t able to talk again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2016, but he outlived the reclassification of his disease. He had what’s known as an IDH mutation in his tumor, and these IDH-positive cancers&lt;a href="https://braintumor.org/news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-updates-to-brain-tumor-classifications-and-grades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; were separated out from glioblastomas in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, becoming what are known as grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas. People with these types of mutations generally live longer than those with glioblastomas without them, which helps explain why Adam blew past the median survival period for glioblastoma by years, even if his fate was always going to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was grateful for those extra years — a stretch of time spent with his family and his writing and his friends. It was more time for simple things that he felt lucky to witness, like walking his boys to the bus stop in the morning, even if his oldest started calling him “Boomer” when he turned 40. When he had a bad day — like when he had to spend hours recovering from a seizure — he tried to remember that other patients and their families’ wished they had been around for more bad days. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam had started being public about his illness early on. In countless social media posts, &lt;a href="https://glioblastology.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@adam__marc?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;TikToks&lt;/a&gt;, he provided updates, pulled back the curtain on the daily experience of living with cancer, and embodied the empathy that he so deeply felt that people should extend to others. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Hey fam,” he would often say at the start of his videos, as if he were about to unveil a new pair of sneakers instead of providing news on the disease that was killing him. And even as the updates grew more serious in recent years, as he faced recurrences, he maintained his lightheartedness. “We don’t know what we’re seeing!” he said one day about a potentially worrying scan, only then to start laughing, a bashful chuckle that evoked an “aw shucks” attitude.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, living so long with a terminal illness — and the costs and stresses that come with it — was exhausting. Through his work in the brain tumor community, he got to know many fellow patients, and then watched as they died. Every few months, he had another brain scan, and knew that one would inevitably be bad news. “Scanxiety” was a term in the cancer world for a reason. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m an energetic and positive guy, but sometimes you just have to say, ‘man, it’s just tough, it’s just tough,”’ he said &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@adam__marc/video/7413369269381008670?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; as he grew emotional talking about the roller coaster of undergoing chemotherapy once again, one of the few times I saw him allow himself to publicly display the weight of his struggles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Adam started hospice care, it was the first time in nearly a decade that he didn’t have a scan booked in his calendar. It was a relief, he said, even if it only came because there was no point anymore in surveilling his tumors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam and Whitney had always maintained, in seemingly unimaginable ways, their humor around his illness. In recent weeks, they found ways to laugh with the boys about his nascent incontinence. And hospice seemed like the perfect excuse to throw on “The Big Lebowski” and drink White Russians — who cares if it was 10 a.m.?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like I said, Adam didn’t need an outside writer to try to put a frame around his situation or to spell out what he was facing. He was more than capable of that. So I’ll end with Adam’s words, which Whitney said were some of his last when he was still conscious. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just want everyone to be kind to each other.” &lt;/p&gt;

Treating &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10k-steps-a-day-walking-b2735565.html"&gt;10,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; as the gold standard for a healthy lifestyle is far more contentious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number stems from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the Manpo-Kei, or “10,000 steps metre”. It’s a nice round number, but it’s not one identified by science as the holy grail for health – a 2023 study by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;University of Granada&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, while more is better, 8,000 is sufficient “to significantly reduce the risk of premature death”​​. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 steps also takes a fair old while. Even at a decent nick, this task is likely to take you upwards of 90 minutes each day, making it a struggle for busy folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-31azim-0 eBMXOi nextSwipeIgnore sentry-block"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU sc-wlmftc-0 ccDPKb"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-hKDTPf hmBpZX"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an alternative walking protocol – colloquially termed “Japanese walking” due to its country of origin – has stepped into the spotlight online. It takes just 30 minutes per day, with fitness coach and content creator &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coacheugeneteo/?hl=en"&gt;Eugene Teo&lt;/a&gt; claiming it offers “10 times the benefits” of walking 10,000 steps per day in his viral video above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer, I’ve covered walking extensively, finding it’s one of the best ways to help people of all fitness levels introduce more movement into their regular routine. So, intrigued, I endeavoured to try “Japanese walking” and find out if the impressive health claims around it held water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to try the ‘Japanese walking’ method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete the sequence below five times without any breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a low intensity (40 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a relaxed pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a high intensity (70 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a brisk pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Japanese walking” protocol comes from a study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2007. It was designed to test whether high-intensity interval walking training (IWT) can offer greater benefits than moderate-intensity continuous walking training, in terms of improving thigh muscle strength, peak aerobic capacity (the maximum amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise) and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five months, 60 men and 186 women with an average age of 63 were divided into three groups; no walking training, IWT and CWT (continuous walking training). The CWT group was instructed to walk at 50 per cent of their peak aerobic capacity (a fairly slow pace) and take 8,000 or more steps per day at least four times per week. The IWT group was told to complete the protocol above, four or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who met these conditions, those in the IWT group saw a 13 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, a 17 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, and an eight per cent increase in peak aerobic capacity for walking. This was “significantly greater than the increases observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found a greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure in the IWT group, despite the fact they didn’t spend as much time walking each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion states: “high-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest walking trend that could help burn more calories and lower blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 htsIMX"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-570453"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (David Lovelady)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I tried Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a full science lab set up at home; what I do have is two legs, a &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-garmin-watch-b1903982.html"&gt;Garmin watch&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of walking experience, so I decided to put these to good use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my Monday lunch break, I took my dog for a 30-minute walk as normal. Then, at 1pm the following day, I tried the “Japanese walking” method on the same looped route, setting my Garmin Vivoactive to record both sessions and taking note of any subjective changes I felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My usual 30-minute walk saw me accrue nearly 3,000 steps, covering 2.12km at an average speed of 14min 10sec per kilometre. My heart rate averaged 85bpm, remaining fairly constant throughout, and I burned an estimated 157 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has owned a dog might expect, there was a good deal of stopping and starting to inspect particularly interesting trees and bollards, and I defaulted to a fairly casual pace amid a busy work day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Japanese walking protocol, my numbers looked a bit different, with my fast pace falling just below 120 steps per minute and my slow pace a few shy of 100 steps per minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I travelled significantly further, covering 2.94km and 3,500 steps at an average speed of 10min 12sec per kilometre. My average heart rate came out very similar (86bpm) but there were noticeable peaks (104bpm) and troughs in line with the high- and low-speed intervals. My estimated calorie burn was also significantly higher: 211. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many steps to take each day to slash your risk of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Japanese walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that walking faster, or sprinkling more intensity into your exercise, holds greater benefits is nothing new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist in walking for health, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://education.ua.edu/about/directory/faculty-directory/elroy-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, is an assistant professor at the University of Alabama’s department of kinesiology. He was the lead author on a 2024 paper published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.14762"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt;, which correlated as little as one minute of high-intensity activity with improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the really interesting findings from our paper was that, if you look at people’s highest one minute of activity across each day, averaged across the monitoring period, that was a very strong signal for whether they had one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors [elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL (or “good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and high blood sugar] present,” he tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another series of studies he worked on, featured in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858465/"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the fact that “if you walk at a cadence of about 100 steps per minute, that’s equivalent to what’s called ‘moderate-intensity’, and all of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, completing the Japanese walking method four times per week leaves you half-an-hour away from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation’s&lt;/a&gt; “global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week”.

However, if we are questioning the claim that it is “better” than walking 10,000 steps a day, there are a few further areas to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Dr Aguiar’s 2024 paper supported the idea that the “best” walking method for reducing metabolic risk factors involves a combination of high volume (number of steps) and high intensity (walking speed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Accumulating a high volume of walking throughout the day [8,000-plus steps], then focussing on at least 30 minutes of faster walking or jogging, would be a way to move the metrics in a positive direction and lower your metrics for each of the [metabolic syndrome] risk factors,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I racked up a little over 3,500 steps when trying the Japanese Walking method – less than half of the 8,000 daily steps research has repeatedly linked to many favourable health outcomes, and short of the 5,000 mark often viewed as the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method as part, rather than all, of your daily steps could be a better approach for achieving your health goals. However, if you only have 30 minutes per day free, it still offers dramatically more benefits than not moving at all, and improved return on investment over a regular 30-minute walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the Japanese walking method loses out to walking 10,000 steps per day is movement regularity. While the former involves a concentrated 30-minute dose of activity, the latter can be spread throughout the day, encouraging you to abandon your office chair and sofa more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10-year study of 8,000 people, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551177/"&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, found that those replaced 30 minutes of daily sitting with light activity had a 17 per cent lower risk of dying in that period. This even applied if they accrued these 30 minutes across short intervals throughout the day – hence why your smartwatch is constantly sending you reminders to stand up and move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement can also help maintain mobility and reduce stiffness in our joints and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we’re dealing with an adaptation from stillness, movement is the answer, so any movement is better than just being still,” movement mechanics expert and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetrainingstimulus.com/"&gt;The Training Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; founder Ash Grossmann summarises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final factor to consider is enjoyment. By adding a rigid framework, Japanese walking ensures intensity. However, it also meant I was unable to stop and chat to people in the park or appreciate my surroundings to the same extent. For me, this lowered the stress-busting potential of my walk, sacrificing some of the usual mental health benefits of walking for physical ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/fart-walk-benefits-type-2-diabetes-cancer-b2744886.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the heck is a fart walk?

But if you can fit one or two quick full-body strength training sessions, regular aerobic activity (like walking) and an occasional dash of more intense exercise into each week, it will stand you in very good stead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is among the most accessible forms of exercise there is, lowering the barrier to entry for exercise for billions of people, which is why I’m always keen to promote it. However, in the modern world, even finding time for a quick walk can be tricky for particularly busy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese walking method provides a time-savvy way to enjoy many of the benefits of a greater volume of daily walking. Sure, you could enjoy higher-intensity exercise in any number of other forms, from cycling to a HIIT workout, but walking remains the most efficient – you don’t even need a change of clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should you try it? Yes, especially if you’re short on time and looking for a way to squeeze health-boosting movement into your day. And should you stick with it? This depends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy this framework, or find it’s something you can stick to with a good degree of regularity, that’s the ticket to a sustainable movement habit and the many health benefits that come from it. If not, look for an alternative form of moderate- to high-intensity exercise that you find fun, and commit to this instead – consistency is the key to long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQNmF1RE5oanpuRUtrSnkyNTN3NU1wNW54dFB5Q2NZR1FXdzNTSVdnVG02TXJoMFZVd1Rpa2xzTWZVV2R6YjBEOWVla0xOdUM0TDRiYzQtZ3dmaTcySXF3eFJ6Z2xVRTNGaEItaTFRSHE2ZmtPcy1ObkJ1d0ZFQy1nV1dLdmFkaUNhcjJkYXJZZkQzS2xib09sOE81ZTJzS3ViYzFpaExCZldZTXM5U1Y5S1hPU01oZw</guid></item></channel></rss>
