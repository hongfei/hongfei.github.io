   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a rule, the stories in our "following up" series look back at previous articles from Goats and Soda. But when freelance journalist Ruchi Kumar pitched the idea of following up on media coverage of a heart transplant for a 12-year-old girl, whose heart had been weakened by illness, we were interested. Doctors drove through one of the most brutal Russian attacks on Kyiv to collect a heart donated by the mother of a 4-year-old who had died of brain injuries from an accident. Here's a look at that extraordinary night — and how the girl with the transplant is now faring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="container large" id="cong-s1-87246-100"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;On the night of July 9, Dr. Borys Todurov, the director of the Kyiv Heart Institute, received a call from a colleague at the Ohmatdyt Hospital across the city. Earlier that evenings, a 4-year-old girl had died of brain injuries from an accident, and her parents had agreed to donate her organs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Todurov had a patient — Kira Skliarova, a 12-year-old girl from Luhansk region of Ukraine — who needed a new heart urgently. Childhood illnesses had severely weakened her own heart. "She was on the waiting list for a long time, and just one day before we implanted her with a mechanical heart, but she needed a transplant," he told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He had to risk his own life to complete the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The donor's body was located about 10 miles from the Heart Institute, which was on that evening under one of the heaviest Russian attacks since the start of the full-scale war in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There were Russian missiles and drones everywhere, the air raid alert was going off," he said. "But we had a chance to save a life so took it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1Dg2zd1hia/" target="_blank"&gt;video made by Todurov&lt;/a&gt; shows their vehicle dodging explosions as Ukrainian air defenses fought off Russian drones. "On our way, we saw a lot of drones, and buildings that they targeted that were on fire," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-88469" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Kira, center, still has a long road to recover but the doctors are optimistic. "Treatment and rehabilitation are ahead," Todurov said, "but Kira now has a chance for a new, full life." Kira is flanked by her mother, right, and the mother of her heart donor, left.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl with a broken heart &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira's family was displaced during the Russian invasion of their region in 2014 and moved to Kyiv as internally displaced refugees. In 2019, the girl developed a severe case of pneumonia, which eventually led to inflammation of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She was diagnosed with post-myocarditis condition, her mother Alyona Skliarova, told NPR over a phone call. For the next six years, Kira endured a rigorous drug treatment regime and was frequently in and out of hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As her condition worsened, especially in the last six months, "her doctor told us, 'It's time to get her on a waiting list for a new heart,'" Skliarova said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On July 8, her team of doctors decided the girl was facing imminent death and so operated to fit her with an artificial heart — an assistive device to help her body pump blood. "When I came to her [after the surgery], she was lying with that mechanism, with the whole thing on the outside, I could see the blood circulating. [It looked] like a suitcase, like the one we take with us when we go to the railway station," her mother said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I was so shocked, really shocked. That image was not for the faint-hearted people to see," she said. "I wondered, if there isn't a donor heart available, how long could one live with this suitcase device."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the attacks of July 9 began, Kira was in the ICU after her surgery. Her mother was in the hospital but had to go to a shelter because of the intense bombing. Her husband — Kira's dad — had died of COVID in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery under fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When news of the donor heart came, Todurov did not hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was a limited window of time to extract the organ and then transplant it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He and his crew — a scrub nurse, a surgeon and an anesthesiologist — drove to the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital amid the bombing and began the procedure, even as the ground beneath their feet shivered from the explosions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"During the extraction, we could not only hear the noises of drones and missiles but also feel the vibrations of the explosion," he said. "We knew it was very, very dangerous, but once we had the heart, it would only be viable for a few hours outside the body, so we decided to transport it right away,"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Back at their own hospital, Todurov's team wasted no time to prep for the heart transplant — even as they felt the building shake from the explosions outside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite the increasing intensity of attacks, they forged ahead. "Surgeries need to be conducted with precision; you need attention, focus, and we are doing this with explosions around us. We are working to save lives, and they are killing civilians around us," Todurov said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A chance at a new life"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a very serious attack that night, but the whole time, I was praying to all the gods, Kira, Kira, Kira," her mother recalled. "Somehow we survived the night, and when the air raid alarms ended, I went to see Kira." Her daughter no longer needed to be connected to the artificial heart contraption. "I felt a relief," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our doctors — they are gods on earth. I am so grateful to them!"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira still has a long road to recover but the doctors are optimistic. "Treatment and rehabilitation are ahead," Todurov said, "but Kira now has a chance for a new, full life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first three days after the transplant were sensitive, her mother said, as her body adjusted to the new heart. "She lost some weight at first. Her organs didn't receive enough blood. and she was vomiting when she ate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After three days, Kira's body embraced her new heart and her health began to improve.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She has some issues with spasticity, where her muscle are stiffened, on the right side of her arm, leg and eye. But she is working with a rehabilitation therapist," her mother said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bittersweet moment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira's transplant has been a bittersweet moment for the mother of the donor — a 4-year old girl whose organs helped save two other lives that fateful night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The mother of the donor visited Kira, said Aloyna Skliarova, "and listened to her daughter's heart beat in Kira's chest. On the one hand, that's a tragedy for [her]. On the other hand, it became a chance for life." She added with gratitude: "I respect her so much, and I'm so grateful for her decision. She gave my child a chance to live."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Mother and daughter are determined to make the best of this new lease at life. "I hope we will have more walks in parks, catch up on everything. There are a lot of things in Kyiv that we haven't yet seen, because we've spent these six years in hospitals or laying at home with the sickness," Skliarova said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One dream is to visit the Carpathian Mountains. "I was there once and I want Kira to see this beauty, go for a walk, climb on [the mount] Khomyak," she said. "We are planning to live. Just to enjoy life, with this new heart. Only God knows what the future will be like, but yes, there is a will to live."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruchi Kumar is a journalist who reports on conflict, politics, development and culture in India and Afghanistan.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The foods you eat play an essential role in staying sharp as you age, and nutrient-packed, flavor-rich and easy-to-follow eating patterns like the Mediterranean diet make the job easier. A smattering of studies reveals just how this eating plan can be a boon to your brain health and mood today—and in the future. Oh, and there are happiness benefits, too.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Promising research shows that the Mediterranean diet may boost brain health in a few key ways: by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/everyday-habits-hurting-your-memory-11804198" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improving factors like memory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-mistakes-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-11779797" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;decreasing the risk of cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and bettering mood.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though various factors are at play that govern cognitive decline, a healthy diet may help tip the scales in your favor. Both the Mediterranean diet and the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290813/mind-diet-best-foods-to-eat-to-keep-your-brain-young/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt; (a diet similar to the Mediterranean diet, but more focused on foods and nutrients specifically known to support brain health) have been shown in randomized controlled trials to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;slow the rate of cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, one study found that people who had the greatest adherence to a Mediterranean diet had a 72% decreased risk of developing dementia compared to those with the lowest adherence.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In that same study, the higher the score one had on a scale that measured adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the younger, or healthier, their brains seemed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study found that those who followed the Mediterranean diet had a 11-30% &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cognitive-health-mediterranean-diet-study-11731307" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduced risk of developing cognitive disorders&lt;/a&gt;, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though exactly why is still being studied, the Mediterranean diet &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/red-meat-dementia-study-8778192" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;limits red meat and highly processed foods&lt;/a&gt; rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;refined carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, added sugars and saturated fat. These types of foods may be more likely to increase the risk of heart disease, insulin resistance and inflammation, which may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-are-aging-your-brain-11717608" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;speed brain aging&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sticking to an eating pattern with similar components as the Mediterranean diet may help keep your mood up. One study found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet reduced the symptoms of depression in young and middle-aged adults with major depression or depressive symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Inflammation may be one of the factors driving depression, and the Mediterranean diet promotes foods packed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-fats-you-should-be-eating-11762137" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory nutrients&lt;/a&gt; from plant-based oils and nuts, fruits and vegetables. Some &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047144/best-anti-inflammatory-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vegetables with the highest anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt; include broccoli, tomatoes, edamame, peppers, collard greens and mushrooms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More specifically, another study showed that subjects who adhered to the Mediterranean diet the most had 40% and 39% lower odds for depression and anxiety, respectively, compared to those who were the least able to follow the diet pattern.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Specifically, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-to-eat-every-week-11757821" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating more fruits and veggies&lt;/a&gt; was found to buoy one's mood the most. The Mediterranean diet is rich in fiber, heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, magnesium and B vitamins, all of which have been shown in prior research to benefit psychological health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cognitive health, dementia and depression are all multifactorial, meaning that many variables —from genes to lifestyle habits, such as diet, exercise or smoking, as well as chronic conditions—are risk factors for these diseases that affect your brain. Though incorporating the principles of the Mediterranean diet in a way that fits your culture and preferences is essential, diet alone isn't the answer. What's more, other aspects of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/8059162/dietitian-syrian-roots-mediterranean-diet/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, such as strong social ties, rest and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-slow-aging-11793621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;regular movement&lt;/a&gt;, are also important for brain health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What foods should you eat for your noggin? There are so many possibilities in a Mediterranean diet—fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans and legumes, nuts and seeds, lean protein and healthy fats. And the healthy eating principles of the diet can be applied to any type of cuisine—you don't need to only eat foods and dishes from Mediterranean countries like Italy, Spain and Greece to gain the health benefits. Here are a few brain-supporting foods to try to fit into your routine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fish: &lt;/strong&gt;Fish is a staple protein on the Mediterranean diet. Opt for healthy preparation methods, such as grilling, broiling and baking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plant-based oils:&lt;/strong&gt; Oils such as olive oil, avocado oil and chia seed oil are packed with heart-healthy fats. Olive oil contains anti-inflammatory components that not only directly impact your brain but may also play a role in the health of your gut microbiome, which can also help protect your brain&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Chia seed oil contains plant-based omega-3 fatty acids to reduce overall inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green leafy vegetables:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether in a salad, stirred into soups or pasta dishes or as a sandwich filler, greens such as spinach, kale, lettuces and arugula are essential on the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruits&lt;/strong&gt;: Fruits are eaten as part of sweet and savory dishes in the Mediterranean diet. Whether fresh, pureed, dried or frozen, they are enjoyed in abundance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pasta&lt;/strong&gt;: In all shapes and sizes, pasta is enjoyed in the Mediterranean diet. It is often used as a vessel to consume more vegetables, olive oil, herbs and spices.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet is more than food. The lifestyle of the Mediterranean and the cognitive benefits that come from it are rooted in the food, social interaction, everyday movement and quality rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet is primarily filled with plant foods. Vegetables, fruits, legumes, beans, nuts, seeds and whole grains are abundant in the Mediterranean diet. Seafood is an important protein, but other lean meats, such as chicken, pork and beef are also consumed in smaller amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ll see it in gyms, yoga studios, and even in your local grocery store’s “healthy beverages” aisle. Marketed as a natural sports drink packed with electrolytes, it’s often called a “miracle hydrator.” But here’s the real deal: while coconut water does have some legit health perks, it’s not perfect—and drinking too much can actually cause problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down the benefits and risks of coconut water in plain English so you can decide whether it deserves a spot in your routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Water Hack?

Natural hydration with electrolytes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wondered, is coconut water good for hydration? — the answer is yes. Coconut water naturally contains electrolytes like potassium, sodium, and magnesium. That’s why it’s popular among athletes, runners, and anyone sweating it out in hot weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you think coconut water is a healthy beverage option?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10534364/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;shows coconut water works just as well as sports drinks for keeping you hydrated. Some studies even suggest it might feel easier on the stomach during long workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Supports heart health &amp;amp; blood pressure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, coconut water is packed with potassium, which helps balance sodium levels in your body. For people with slightly high blood pressure, this can be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some small studies link coconut water to better circulation, lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, and a boost in HDL (“good”) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch: if your potassium levels are already normal, you probably won’t see a huge heart-health benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. May help with blood sugar &amp;amp; antioxidants&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024170417" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;show coconut water may improve blood sugar control and reduce diabetes-related damage. It also contains antioxidants that help fight free radicals, which can cause cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, human research is still limited. If you have diabetes, coconut water isn’t a magic cure, but choosing unsweetened coconut water over soda or juice is a healthier option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Kidney stone prevention&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9262403/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;suggests coconut water can help reduce the risk of kidney stones by increasing the excretion of potassium, citrate, and chloride. Basically, it may help your body flush out minerals that can build up into stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have kidney disease, a moderate amount of coconut water may be a kidney-friendly choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Digestive &amp;amp; immune support&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water has small amounts of enzymes that may support digestion. Plus, it contains vitamin C and lauric acid, which may help with immunity. The effects are subtle, but every little bit helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The risks of coconut water&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for the not-so-fun part. Coconut water isn’t risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Too much potassium can be dangerous&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it’s so high in potassium, drinking too much coconut water can cause hyperkalemia (excess potassium in the blood). This can lead to irregular heartbeats and, in severe cases, cardiac arrest. People with kidney disease or those taking potassium-sparing meds should be especially careful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Digestive issues &amp;amp; allergies&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water acts like a mild laxative for some people, which can lead to diarrhea or too much urination if overdone. It can also trigger allergic reactions in those sensitive to coconuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sugar &amp;amp; calories add up&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s natural, coconut water has sugar—around 6–8 grams per cup. For someone with diabetes or watching calories, this can sneak up on you. Always go for unsweetened coconut water instead of flavored or added-sugar versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contamination risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re traveling and drinking straight from a questionable coconut, there’s a small chance of bacterial or fungal contamination. Rare cases of food poisoning have been reported. Safer bet: stick to pasteurized coconut water from trusted brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should drink coconut water?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water is great for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy adults looking for a refreshing, low-calorie drink&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Athletes or anyone sweating a lot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People needing a mild potassium boost&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may not be ideal for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with kidney problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those on potassium-altering medications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone with diabetes (unless consumed in moderation)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much coconut water is safe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most healthy adults, 1 cup (about 8 oz) a few times a week is perfectly fine. Just don’t chug liters of it daily and expect miracle results. Think of it as a supplement to your hydration, not a replacement for good old-fashioned water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is coconut water good for you? Yes, when enjoyed in moderation. It’s refreshing, naturally hydrating, and comes with some real health benefits like supporting hydration, heart health, and possibly kidney stone prevention. But it’s not a super-drink, and too much can actually be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy coconut water as part of a balanced diet, but don’t rely on it to fix health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 03:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-AFBVV95cUxPekh6SjJ3dmQtSmdtR1VGVWVFbFhWUlJfZ3hxVkU4N1dRSUY3VnhHVXRldWxGbGc3RE1BZExpd2RFMlBpUTdmWGF0MWJMVDg5MER6NGQ1VS1UXzM3OWtObzZIUUZuUGozU1dQMVJNT1M1Z25aLWZpTTVldVh3ZlZjLXpiQTFEWU5sdkNER2JhYTREbkw5cG1mWmhqbTFvSEZtYWZyN0RDVU5DWmNvN3Jwak1JYm5aalp1bU9KTlF5eTRZUUNueVFhREIwVWx0RUllMWJIOW03RjRrRmpPbWJBUHoxWC1lMHZvb0dQczlxbmowTy1PWmZtU9IB_gFBVV95cUxQaHFneFJkYkVNMXM0aWxKb1UxOGZMYzVWNkNsTm15ZHotMUJPUlpTSVdqOFdQaXZGUGN6WWUyNGdvZjlNYzR5cThXMVV4cmdhdjdxQUcyQ1R6QlhrY3JwMzkteGdTN3hKYmRaWFA2MWhtT1VndGo2V1dpam93UmJGd2otZEZ6d0d5S0ZyX2gyQTk2eFFRR3JWZUwtZmdJdnNyVnpaVFB3X0xDVDlPd1RXUVBTb2pWSF9OcDJ3ajNpUkJtUmxGcHE0cUxRbEpmYnRFeEhiS0wwc01qRUVGdjBOX3BMX0dJVTQ0UDJmZlBfTktYSzJ5SnZRX3VidDJ5QQ</guid></item><item><title>如果你总是有压力，心理学说这9种爱好可以舒缓你的神经系统- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/r-if-youre-always-stressed-psychology-says-these-9-hobbies-will-soothe-your-nervous-system/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="428" data-end="710"&gt;Stress has a way of sneaking into everything. It shows up in tense shoulders, restless sleep, and the constant feeling that you’re running on empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="428" data-end="710"&gt;The busier life gets, the more your nervous system carries the weight—and most of us don’t realize how badly we need ways to reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="712" data-end="1009"&gt;Hobbies might sound like an afterthought when you’re stressed, but psychology says they’re actually one of the best tools for calming the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="712" data-end="1009"&gt;They give your mind a break from the endless loop of work, notifications, and worries, while signaling to your nervous system that it’s safe to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1011" data-end="1143"&gt;Here are nine hobbies backed by research that can help you turn down the volume on stress and bring your system back into balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1145" data-end="1162"&gt;1. Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1164" data-end="1376"&gt;I still remember planting my first herb pot on the tiny balcony of my first apartment. Watching those fragile green shoots push through the soil felt strangely healing, like I was rooting myself alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1378" data-end="1681"&gt;Psychologists often point to the restorative effects of nature. A study in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2019/04/09/20-minute-nature-pill-relieves-stress"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1453" data-end="1478"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that gardening reduces cortisol (the stress hormone) and improves mood even after short periods of time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1378" data-end="1681"&gt;For stressed people, this is more than a pastime—it’s a form of natural therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1683" data-end="1902"&gt;Even if you don’t have a backyard, tending to herbs on a windowsill or a couple of houseplants can bring a sense of calm. The act of watering, pruning, and watching something grow gives you a gentle, grounding anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1904" data-end="1922"&gt;2. Journaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1924" data-end="2160"&gt;Have you ever felt like your mind is running twenty tabs at once? Writing them down can feel like finally closing a few. Journaling gives stressed people a private outlet to process the constant churn without judgment or interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2162" data-end="2440"&gt;Research published in the &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374669665_Expressive_Writing_Moderates_the_Relation_Between_Intrusive_Thoughts_and_Depressive_Symptoms#:~:text=Expressive%20writing%20moderates%20the%20relation%20between%20intrusive,or%20by%20desensitizing%20people%20to%20such%20thoughts."&gt;&lt;em data-start="2188" data-end="2224"&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that expressive writing helps regulate emotions and reduce intrusive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2162" data-end="2440"&gt;By turning nebulous worries into concrete words, your nervous system relaxes—you’re literally organizing your feelings on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2442" data-end="2656"&gt;Start simple: jot down three thoughts before bed, or keep a running log of moments that made you feel grateful, overwhelmed, or inspired. Over time, those pages become a roadmap for understanding yourself better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2658" data-end="2670"&gt;3. Yoga&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2672" data-end="2897"&gt;Step onto a mat, and you’re stepping into one of the most proven practices for nervous system regulation. Yoga combines mindful breathing with slow, deliberate movement, giving stressed bodies a safe way to release tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2899" data-end="3154"&gt;A meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245214"&gt;&lt;em data-start="2918" data-end="2928"&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that yoga reduces anxiety and stress by modulating the parasympathetic nervous system—the system responsible for rest and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2899" data-end="3154"&gt;For someone whose nervous system is constantly running hot, that’s game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3156" data-end="3392"&gt;You don’t need a fancy studio or expensive gear. A quiet corner, a mat, and a short online video can be enough. Even five minutes of stretching with intentional breaths can shift your body out of fight-or-flight and back into balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3394" data-end="3424"&gt;4. Knitting or crocheting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3426" data-end="3672"&gt;When my grandmother taught me to crochet, I thought I’d never get the hang of it. Then one evening I realized hours had passed and my brain had been blissfully quiet the entire time. Without me noticing it, the repetitive motions had lulled me into a meditative state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3674" data-end="4033"&gt;That’s the beauty of fiber arts—they occupy your hands just enough to calm the mind without overstimulating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3674" data-end="4033"&gt;Psychologists describe this as “&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-flow-2794768"&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt;,” a term coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, which refers to the mental state of being fully immersed and losing track of time. Flow states have been shown to reduce stress and increase feelings of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4035" data-end="4186"&gt;Knitting, crocheting, or even weaving are hobbies that let stressed people settle into rhythm and quiet focus, soothing frayed nerves in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4188" data-end="4213"&gt;5. Walking in nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4215" data-end="4388"&gt;There’s a reason a long walk in the park can feel like medicine. For stressed people, being outside in natural spaces is like hitting a reset button on the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4390" data-end="4747"&gt;Psychological research backs this up: a study in &lt;a href="https://environhealthprevmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s12199-009-0086-9#:~:text=The%20results%20show%20that%20forest,a%20strategy%20for%20preventive%20medicine."&gt;&lt;em data-start="4439" data-end="4485"&gt;Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that spending time in forests (often called “forest bathing”) lowers heart rate and reduces stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4390" data-end="4747"&gt;If you're constantly weighed down by daily tension, a wooded trail or even a tree-lined neighborhood walk can bring down the static in your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4749" data-end="4903"&gt;You don’t need a destination. Just moving your body and letting your senses tune in to birdsong, leaves rustling, or the smell of soil can restore calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4905" data-end="4934"&gt;6. Painting or sketching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4936" data-end="5137"&gt;A blank page and a handful of colors can do more for stress than most people realize. Creative expression allows you to externalize what you’re feeling, transforming pressure into something tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5139" data-end="5400"&gt;Art therapy is well-studied in psychology. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5836011/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that even simple drawing or painting can reduce cortisol and create a state of relaxation. You don’t have to be an artist—the act matters more than the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5139" data-end="5400"&gt;I once tried urban sketching during a particularly stressful season, carrying a small notebook and pen on my lunch breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5139" data-end="5400"&gt;Sitting on a park bench, sketching buildings and strangers passing by, I realized how quickly my focus shifted from my own worries to the lines and shapes in front of me. By the time I put my pen away, my thoughts felt calmer and more ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5402" data-end="5549"&gt;Let yourself doodle, paint abstract swirls, or sketch without rules. It’s about giving your emotions a place to land where words aren’t required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5551" data-end="5587"&gt;7. Playing a musical instrument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5589" data-end="5785"&gt;Have you ever noticed how playing music can pull you out of your head? Strumming a guitar, tapping piano keys, or even trying a hand drum shifts your focus from overthinking to rhythm and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5787" data-end="6100"&gt;Psychologists note that music-making engages multiple parts of the brain, stimulating relaxation and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5787" data-end="6100"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11742191/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, musical activities lower stress and promote emotional resilience. For people under constant stress, it’s not just fun—it’s therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6102" data-end="6292"&gt;Pick an instrument that feels approachable, even if it’s something simple like a kalimba or ukulele. The act of playing—however imperfect—creates a soothing dialogue between you and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6294" data-end="6334"&gt;8. Cooking simple, nourishing meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6336" data-end="6589"&gt;There’s a comfort in chopping vegetables, stirring a simmering pot, and tasting as flavors come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6336" data-end="6589"&gt;In fact, this is one of my go-to hobbies whenever life feels overwhelming. Cooking can be both grounding and sensory-friendly, offering a safe space to engage touch, smell, and taste in calming ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6591" data-end="6788"&gt;Cooking also creates predictability—something we crave when life feels out of control. The sequence of steps and the satisfaction of a finished dish can bring the nervous system a sense of order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6790" data-end="6936"&gt;It doesn’t need to be elaborate. Even preparing a pot of soup or baking bread can feel like a ritual that centers your body and eases your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6938" data-end="6971"&gt;9. Meditation and breathwork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6973" data-end="7172"&gt;Living with stress means your awareness is constantly heightened, and that can be exhausting. Meditation and breathwork give that awareness a direction, turning it from overwhelming to restorative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7174" data-end="7462"&gt;A large body of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3004979/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; supports this. Mindfulness meditation increases gray matter in brain regions linked to emotional regulation. In other words, it helps train your nervous system to respond more calmly to life’s stressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7464" data-end="7694"&gt;Even a few minutes of slow, deliberate breathing—inhale for four, hold for four, exhale for four—can shift your system out of fight-or-flight. Over time, this practice becomes a tool you can rely on whenever life feels too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7696" data-end="7715"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7717" data-end="7896"&gt;Stress might be part of life, but it doesn’t have to run the show. These hobbies are more than just ways to pass time—they’re tools your nervous system can lean on to find rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7898" data-end="8206"&gt;You don’t need to tackle all nine. Start with one or two that feel doable and notice how your body responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7898" data-end="8206"&gt;Whether it’s gardening, journaling, or cooking something simple, the point is the same: giving yourself regular, reliable ways to calm down is one of the most powerful antidotes to constant stress.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

I’d never heard of thyroid cancer. It was such a shock.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similar cases are becoming increasingly common. Thyroid cancer – which affects the small, butterfly-shaped gland in the neck – has soared over the past two decades. In the UK, diagnoses have risen by 62 per cent in just ten years and are expected to climb by nearly three-quarters by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thyroid makes and releases hormones that control many important functions, including metabolism – how the body uses energy – as well as heart rate, temperature and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is one of five cancers rising in younger adults, according to the American Cancer Society, alongside throat, prostate, kidney and colon. And cases of thyroid cancer are nearly four times higher in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colombian-American actress Sofia Vergara, British actress Marisa Abela, and Love Island star Demi Jones have all spoken publicly in recent years about their diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actress Sofia Vergara underwent treatment for thyroid cancer when she was 28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each of them developed the disease before the age of 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say the surge in thyroid cancer cases may partly be explained by improvements in medical technology, with more tumours detected that might otherwise have gone unnoticed and never caused problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-739e2530-90c0-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 7,000 children developed thyroid cancer in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some doctors point to a more controversial reason: that medical technology itself is actually fuelling the rise. They warn that excessive use of X-rays and CT scans expose patients to unnecessary radiation, which can raise the risk of developing the cancer. Children are most at risk, as exposure at a young age is more likely to cause problems decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It sounds alarming, yet in June a major study reached a similarly stark conclusion. Researchers found that about 5 per cent of all new cancers in the US could be linked to CT scans – a toll comparable to those caused by alcohol. About 4,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with thyroid cancer each year, most of them aged between 70 and 74. But cases have almost tripled over the past three decades, with young women the fastest-growing group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wider rise in cancers among younger adults has drawn considerable attention in recent months, with experts pointing to ultra-processed foods, obesity and even certain strains of gut bacteria as possible drivers. However, when it comes to thyroid cancer, specialists say the explanation is less straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s no doubt of an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer over the past 25 years,’ said Professor Fausto Palazzo, an endocrine surgeon at Hammersmith Hospital in west London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In large part, we believe it’s related to the fact that we’re simply detecting more disease.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, he added, that doesn’t mean more cancers aren’t developing than before. ‘It just makes it more difficult to interpret.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors warn that excessive use of X-rays and CT scans expose patients to unnecessary radiation, which can raise the risk of developing the cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key question, he said, is whether there is something that is making thyroid cancer more common in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The only two things we know that increase the chance of thyroid cancer are genetic history and radiation exposure,’ he continued. ‘And while there has been some theorising that an increase in radiation exposure in the environment in recent decades could be contributing to cases, it’s very difficult to prove.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts are attempting to do just this. Dr Riccardo Vigneri, emeritus professor of endocrinology at the University of Catania in Italy, has spent decades studying thyroid cancer. In a 2020 paper he analysed 18 years of data from the Californian death registry. If the surge were due only to overdetection, the records would show a rise mainly in small, slow-growing tumours – the kind that may not cause harm. Instead, they showed a marked increase in larger, more advanced cancers, along with a rise in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That, he argued, was clear evidence the trend could not be explained by scanning alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘All evidence indicates the causes of worldwide increase in thyroid cancers are recent, environmental and multiple,’ he wrote in the journal Cancers. The ‘most likely contributing factor’, his team concluded, was increased exposure to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Historically, the most severe exposures followed nuclear events – from the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Chernobyl – where children nearby developed thyroid tumours at high rates. But today, the greatest source of man-made radiation comes from medicine –diagnostic tests such as X-rays and CT scans, which use high-energy beams to produce detailed images of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-93c95050-90c0-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thyroid gland is responsible for producing the hormones that control the body’s temperature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A landmark analysis by researchers from several US universities showed that, between 1980 and 2006, the average radiation dose received by Americans had doubled – with CT scans responsible for more than half of that exposure. Around a third of all CTs were directed at the head and neck. Children face the greatest risk, as their developing tissues are especially sensitive to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study of more than 11 million Australians found that children who underwent CT scans had a 40 per cent higher risk of thyroid cancer later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, endocrinologists at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago warned that the surge in medical radiation was running in parallel with rising thyroid cancer rates, and urged doctors to limit the use of CT scans in young patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts stress that the scans are often lifesaving – they’re vital for detecting tumours, internal bleeding or serious infections – and that the overall risk to any individual patient remains very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies suggest thyroid cancer may also be linked to radon gas – a natural by-product of uranium in the ground that seeps into homes. Already known to cause lung cancer, a 2020 study from the University of Guam found signs it could raise thyroid cancer risk too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But many experts say it is too soon to draw firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In medicine, we’re stuck with epidemiology – the study of disease in a population – to guide us in deciding whether or not a certain factor is responsible,’ said Prof Palazzo. ‘And without this type of large-scale research, we can’t say anything with certainty.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research is looking beyond radiation, including the role of iodine – a trace mineral essential for producing thyroid hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iodine is found in fish, dairy products and eggs, yet a 2010 study of more than 700 UK schoolgirls showed over two-thirds were deficient. Historically, about half of Britain’s iodine intake came from milk – but levels have fallen with the decline of free school milk and the rise of vegan and dairy-free diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regions where iodine deficiency is common also tend to report higher rates of thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the thyroid needs iodine to make hormones, explained Dr Jahangir Ahmed, consultant ENT surgeon at OneWelbeck in London. ‘If you’re not getting enough iodine, the thyroid gland can become bigger, thinking it will help it make more,’ he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When this happens, the growth driver might also cause mutations in the thyroid cells, which is the precursor to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The same thing happens in pregnancy – the baby demands more iodine, which can make the mother deficient.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has pointed to hormone-disrupting chemicals and air pollution as possible drivers. A 2022 study by the University of Beijing found thyroid cancer rates were higher in areas with poor air quality. Scientists at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Shenzhen, China, also reported links between the disease and endocrine-disrupting compounds found in everyday products such as flame-retardants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2020 study, researchers from Tulane University in the US and Egypt’s Suez Canal University concluded there was ‘strong evidence’ that certain man-made chemicals can impair thyroid function, raising the risk of future tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for why women seem to be more affected than men, the answer is similarly speculative. ‘It’s most likely hormone related,’ said Dr Ahmed, ‘as we know after menopause that the rates of men and women getting thyroid cancer start to come together.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women may also be at higher risk because of their increased likelihood of autoimmune conditions, where the body begins to attack the thyroid gland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed added: ‘This causes chronic inflammation, and can make the thyroid more prone to cell mutation.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s important to remember that thyroid cancer generally has an excellent prognosis. While some forms are more aggressive, the two most common types – papillary and follicular – are usually slow-growing and highly treatable. ‘If you catch it in a reasonable time, more than 90 per cent of patients can be cured,’ said Dr Ahmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs and symptoms of thyroid cancer include a lump in the throat or neck, a hoarse voice lasting more than three weeks, breathing problems or difficulty swallowing. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor without delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment often involves surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid, sometimes followed by radioactive iodine therapy to destroy any remaining thyroid cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For very small tumours, less than a centimetre across, doctors may recommend monitoring rather than operating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I reassure the majority of my patients that they’ve got time,’ said Dr Ahmed. ‘With a few exceptions, thyroid cancers have an excellent prognosis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;I was diagnosed aged 31... and there were no warning signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was during a rare attempt to relax that special needs teacher Jess Cain, right, now 35, first discovered the lump in her neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was having a massage and the masseuse immediately told me something didn’t feel right,’ said Jess, pictured right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I felt it too and agreed. It was like a marble under the skin, beneath my ear, that became more prominent when I turned my head.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerned, Jess booked an appointment with her GP, who reassured the then 31-year-old it was most likely a swollen lymph node from an oncoming cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A week later she still felt fine but the lump hadn’t gone. After insisting on being seen again, Jess was referred for a scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Months later, an ultrasound revealed a suspicious mass in her neck. And just five days before Christmas, she was told it was cancerous. A biopsy and surgery in January confirmed it was thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was so confused,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had had no symptoms and, when I was diagnosed, I didn’t know anyone with thyroid cancer at all.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then Jess has had her thyroid removed, undergone radioactive iodine therapy, and endured further surgery to shave down part of her neck. Now she wants others to understand how destabilising the disease can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘People refer to it as “the good cancer” because it’s easily treated, but it’s already been two years with it for me and I’ve already had a resurgence within three months of getting the all-clear,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s no such thing as a good cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 00:41:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQOGw2NUw4Wnk3UWlYWWhPV3FtcTdUZ2JFc05DRXlXSkJHb2Vsd3BlVlFyVjZWbmNmVWNUTF91TDFkY19zSTB5QUVZZTRhcVFIYVhQRUVRZTl6dHNJbmgwVVRRRUdmaGF3djBEaGJjSnNfcS1ETlVhR2tfVkhackNNZzJwQWRuckNacExsOEZqODhVVmkxY1ZMcmZUQk1RTElGZFBQZjQyUQ</guid></item><item><title>常见的测试医生担心甲状腺癌激增的背后-每日邮报</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just 31 and in good health, Jess Cain was horrified to discover a small lump in her neck, which she had thought little of, was &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-006a86e0-90bf-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The special needs teacher felt well, with no symptoms, and went to the doctor only after a massage therapist spotted the growth and urged her to get it checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Expecting reassurance, she was instead diagnosed with thyroid cancer and told she would need surgery almost immediately, followed by months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My surgeon told me I’d likely had the tumour for almost a decade,’ recalled Jess. ‘But I hadn’t had any pain or any other symptoms. I’d never heard of thyroid cancer. It was such a shock.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similar cases are becoming increasingly common. Thyroid cancer – which affects the small, butterfly-shaped gland in the neck – has soared over the past two decades. In the UK, diagnoses have risen by 62 per cent in just ten years and are expected to climb by nearly three-quarters by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thyroid makes and releases hormones that control many important functions, including metabolism – how the body uses energy – as well as heart rate, temperature and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is one of five cancers rising in younger adults, according to the American Cancer Society, alongside throat, prostate, kidney and colon. And cases of thyroid cancer are nearly four times higher in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colombian-American actress Sofia Vergara, British actress Marisa Abela, and Love Island star Demi Jones have all spoken publicly in recent years about their diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actress Sofia Vergara underwent treatment for thyroid cancer when she was 28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each of them developed the disease before the age of 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say the surge in thyroid cancer cases may partly be explained by improvements in medical technology, with more tumours detected that might otherwise have gone unnoticed and never caused problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-739e2530-90c0-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 7,000 children developed thyroid cancer in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some doctors point to a more controversial reason: that medical technology itself is actually fuelling the rise. They warn that excessive use of X-rays and CT scans expose patients to unnecessary radiation, which can raise the risk of developing the cancer. Children are most at risk, as exposure at a young age is more likely to cause problems decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It sounds alarming, yet in June a major study reached a similarly stark conclusion. Researchers found that about 5 per cent of all new cancers in the US could be linked to CT scans – a toll comparable to those caused by alcohol. About 4,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with thyroid cancer each year, most of them aged between 70 and 74. But cases have almost tripled over the past three decades, with young women the fastest-growing group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wider rise in cancers among younger adults has drawn considerable attention in recent months, with experts pointing to ultra-processed foods, obesity and even certain strains of gut bacteria as possible drivers. However, when it comes to thyroid cancer, specialists say the explanation is less straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s no doubt of an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer over the past 25 years,’ said Professor Fausto Palazzo, an endocrine surgeon at Hammersmith Hospital in west London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In large part, we believe it’s related to the fact that we’re simply detecting more disease.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, he added, that doesn’t mean more cancers aren’t developing than before. ‘It just makes it more difficult to interpret.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors warn that excessive use of X-rays and CT scans expose patients to unnecessary radiation, which can raise the risk of developing the cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key question, he said, is whether there is something that is making thyroid cancer more common in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The only two things we know that increase the chance of thyroid cancer are genetic history and radiation exposure,’ he continued. ‘And while there has been some theorising that an increase in radiation exposure in the environment in recent decades could be contributing to cases, it’s very difficult to prove.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts are attempting to do just this. Dr Riccardo Vigneri, emeritus professor of endocrinology at the University of Catania in Italy, has spent decades studying thyroid cancer. In a 2020 paper he analysed 18 years of data from the Californian death registry. If the surge were due only to overdetection, the records would show a rise mainly in small, slow-growing tumours – the kind that may not cause harm. Instead, they showed a marked increase in larger, more advanced cancers, along with a rise in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That, he argued, was clear evidence the trend could not be explained by scanning alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘All evidence indicates the causes of worldwide increase in thyroid cancers are recent, environmental and multiple,’ he wrote in the journal Cancers. The ‘most likely contributing factor’, his team concluded, was increased exposure to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Historically, the most severe exposures followed nuclear events – from the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Chernobyl – where children nearby developed thyroid tumours at high rates.

&lt;li&gt;In 2022, both the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; and Congress commissioned reports on the health effects of alcohol, to be provided to the committee that produces the United States government's dietary guidelines every five years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2025, days before President Donald Trump took office, a &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf"&gt;draft of the two studies&lt;/a&gt; was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/15/2025-00416/request-for-public-comments-on-reports-on-alcoholic-beverages-and-health-to-inform-the-dietary"&gt;Federal Register&lt;/a&gt; for public comment. The health department's study found that alcohol was very risky to health, while the study commissioned by Congress found that a small amount of alcohol might be slightly beneficial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info#what-does-the-dietary-guidelines-say-about-alcoholic-beverages-"&gt;Current dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend that people who do not drink alcohol should not "&lt;span&gt;start drinking for any reason." The guidelines recommend men limit themselves to two drinks a day, and women limit themselves to one drink a day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In June 2025, Reuters published a story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that said four anonymous sources claimed the committee responsible for producing the 2025-30 dietary guidelines planned to drop the recommended limits on alcohol consumption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health"&gt;In September 2025, Vox published a story&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Trump's administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had "buried" the health department's study. This is somewhat true — researchers were informed their final report would not be published in any form — and somewhat false — the draft version of the report was available to read online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 4, 2025, Vox &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health"&gt;published a story&lt;/a&gt; that claimed U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the White House had "buried" a major study on alcohol and cancer. The story detailed the convoluted path of the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study"&gt;Alcohol Intake and Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, initially commissioned in 2022 by the nation's health department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vox's story claimed the study (technically a meta-analysis, or a &lt;comment-start name="ea59068b10dacd768b952be487e7fb6dd:202ec"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;review&lt;comment-end name="ea59068b10dacd768b952be487e7fb6dd:202ec"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt; of existing research), which found an "increased mortality for seven types of cancer" at all levels of alcohol usage, had been hidden from public knowledge by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kennedy, his health secretary. (Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet"&gt;has been classified as a carcinogen&lt;/a&gt; since as early as 1987, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2834641?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamaoncol.2025.1146"&gt;but that isn't well-known&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/g5SkH"&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/uXcx4"&gt;on social&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/7pb96"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;, and Snopes readers emailed and searched the site looking for more information about whether the administration had prevented the study's publication. &lt;comment-start name="e48f8c8843f6b2dbdd2fbdd1dcb8984af:f98ae"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;We contacted the health agency, the White House and scientists involved in the study for comment. &lt;comment-end name="e48f8c8843f6b2dbdd2fbdd1dcb8984af:f98ae"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;We had not heard back from the White House at time of publication; &lt;comment-start name="e03ca3ed2501608d598d0e3037931eb66:e1a3a"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;the health department provided basic information on the study but did not respond to specific questions.&lt;comment-end name="e03ca3ed2501608d598d0e3037931eb66:e1a3a"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study &lt;i&gt;was,&lt;/i&gt; in fact, publicly available. In the days before Trump returned to office in late January 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf"&gt;a draft version was published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/15/2025-00416/request-for-public-comments-on-reports-on-alcoholic-beverages-and-health-to-inform-the-dietary"&gt;Federal Register&lt;/a&gt; to allow for public comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite the study's authors sending the government their final version in March 2025, according to Vox's reporting, the final report had not been published, as of this writing. Three of the authors told Vox they learned the administration was&lt;span&gt; not going to publish the study in any form, but did not say who gave them that information. (In an email to Snopes, one author, Tim Naimi, declined to elaborate but said he was "confident" that information was correct).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are further complications to the story, too. The study was supposed to be included in a presentation to Congress on underage drinking, but the &lt;comment-start name="eb2fadb8bf69497da4c546477291b5a39:e6a95"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;researchers told Vox their report would not be &lt;comment-end name="eb2fadb8bf69497da4c546477291b5a39:e6a95"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;included. The study also was supposed to inform the United States' dietary guidelines for the next five years, but &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/"&gt;Reuters reported in June&lt;/a&gt; that the government was planning to drop the recommended daily limit for alcohol from its guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the complicated situation, we have elected to forgo a rating. Here's what we know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dietary guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every five years, the Health and Human Services and Agriculture departments collaborate to release the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, a list of recommended eating and drinking habits aimed to keep citizens healthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to prepare the guidelines, the government asks a committee of scientists and doctors to produce a comprehensive advisory report on the state of the average American health and diet and any recommended changes to the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, before 2020, the dietary guidelines recommended that men limit alcohol consumption to two drinks per day, and women to one drink per day. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/ScientificReport_of_the_2020DietaryGuidelinesAdvisoryCommittee_first-print.pdf"&gt;the committee's report recommended&lt;/a&gt; lowering the daily limit for alcohol consumption to one drink per day across the board. The report is only advisory, and the 2020 dietary guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info#what-does-the-dietary-guidelines-say-about-alcoholic-beverages-"&gt;kept the previous limit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://archive.ph/MSstG"&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The two alcohol studies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the health department commissioned a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;comment-start name="ef7b298c583a84cf04e5f859295f61728:a6038"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study"&gt;Alcohol Intake and Health Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;comment-end name="ef7b298c583a84cf04e5f859295f61728:a6038"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;, conducted by a group of outside scientists. (This is the one the Vox headline claimed has been "buried").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that year, Congress commissioned the National Academies to write a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Review of Evidence on Alcohol and Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health"&gt;The Vox story&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Congress commissioned the alcohol health study &lt;comment-start name="e5a86aed2cf17e0274a771750f06e830f:ae2ea"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;because of lobbying from the alcohol industry, which alleged the independent scientists were anti-alcohol. &lt;comment-end name="e5a86aed2cf17e0274a771750f06e830f:ae2ea"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;One co-author on the health department's study told Vox that lawmakers claimed she had a conflict of interest because she "&lt;span&gt;accurately described scientific research in the media." Another author, Naimi, told Snopes he was "very proud" of his record, and that criticism from politicians and industry "comes with &lt;comment-start name="e53f28fb8272f5a98713025358f90c321:46bf3"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;the subject matter" of alcohol. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;comment-end name="e53f28fb8272f5a98713025358f90c321:46bf3"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both studies were commissioned with the idea that they would be provided to the committee in charge of producing 2025-30 dietary guidelines. Vox also reported that the health department's study was supposed to factor into an annual report to Congress on underage drinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the studies were published in January 2025, in the days before Trump took office, the differences in their findings were clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health department's study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming alcohol was very risky for health, while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the National Academies' study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming a small amount of alcohol might even be beneficial. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the health department told Snopes via email that "&lt;span&gt;a final version was subsequently provided … &lt;comment-start name="e03b6905823d821e77b053302ff64fc9a:b26ff"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;to HHS/OASH&lt;comment-end name="e03b6905823d821e77b053302ff64fc9a:b26ff"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt; [the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health] and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for consideration as the development of the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines, which remains ongoing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snopes also asked the health department who was involved in the reported decision to not publish the final version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, and whether the dietary guidelines committee was considering dropping its guidance on a daily limit for alcohol consumption, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/"&gt;as reported by Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. We did not receive a response to those questions. &lt;/p&gt;

Here's what we know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Dietary guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Every five years, the Health and Human Services and Agriculture departments collaborate to release the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, a list of recommended eating and drinking habits aimed to keep citizens healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In order to prepare the guidelines, the government asks a committee of scientists and doctors to produce a comprehensive advisory report on the state of the average American health and diet and any recommended changes to the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, before 2020, the dietary guidelines recommended that men limit alcohol consumption to two drinks per day, and women to one drink per day. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/ScientificReport_of_the_2020DietaryGuidelinesAdvisoryCommittee_first-print.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the committee's report recommended;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the committee's report recommended&lt;/a&gt; lowering the daily limit for alcohol consumption to one drink per day across the board. The report is only advisory, and the 2020 dietary guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info#what-does-the-dietary-guidelines-say-about-alcoholic-beverages-" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kept the previous limit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;kept the previous limit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://archive.ph/MSstG" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:archived;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The two alcohol studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2022, the health department commissioned a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alcohol Intake and Health Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alcohol Intake and Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, conducted by a group of outside scientists. (This is the one the Vox headline claimed has been "buried").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Later that year, Congress commissioned the National Academies to write a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Review of Evidence on Alcohol and Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;Review of Evidence on Alcohol and Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Vox story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Vox story&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Congress commissioned the alcohol health study because of lobbying from the alcohol industry, which alleged the independent scientists were anti-alcohol. One co-author on the health department's study told Vox that lawmakers claimed she had a conflict of interest because she "&lt;span&gt;accurately described scientific research in the media." Another author, Naimi, told Snopes he was "very proud" of his record, and that criticism from politicians and industry "comes with the subject matter" of alcohol. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both studies were commissioned with the idea that they would be provided to the committee in charge of producing 2025-30 dietary guidelines. Vox also reported that the health department's study was supposed to factor into an annual report to Congress on underage drinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the studies were published in January 2025, in the days before Trump took office, the differences in their findings were clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The health department's study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health department's study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming alcohol was very risky for health, while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the National Academies' study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;the National Academies' study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming a small amount of alcohol might even be beneficial. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spokesperson for the health department told Snopes via email that "&lt;span&gt;a final version was subsequently provided … to HHS/OASH [the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health] and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for consideration as the development of the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines, which remains ongoing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Snopes also asked the health department who was involved in the reported decision to not publish the final version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, and whether the dietary guidelines committee was considering dropping its guidance on a daily limit for alcohol consumption, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:as reported by Reuters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;as reported by Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.

							&lt;p&gt;Have you been told you should get a check-up and clean every six months? Perhaps your dental clinic’s or health insurance policy’s default is to ask you to book these services twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at whether this advice is based on evidence or opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you need regular check-ups and cleans?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A regular oral health checkup usually involves a dentist or oral health practitioner (dental therapist, dental hygienist, oral health therapist) examining the teeth, gums and surrounding structures of the mouth. This helps identify signs of tooth decay or gum disease, in addition to any changes to soft tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most instances, you will have your teeth professionally cleaned in the same visit, with a “scale and clean”, along with dental x-rays to identify issues that aren’t visible to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular brushing with fluoride toothpaste and cleaning between teeth (for example, by flossing) at home can’t reach all the surfaces of the teeth and gums. Professional cleaning is needed to remove the remaining plaque and tartar (calcified dental plaque) and the bacteria they contain, which cause tooth decay and gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the research evidence say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all research is equal: some types of evidence are more reliable than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cochrane systematic reviews are the most trusted because they use rigorous methods to collect and evaluate all available research evidence on a specific health question. These reviews judge how strong the evidence is and whether the studies might be affected by bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adult oral health check-ups, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004346.pub5"&gt;2020 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; found strong evidence that six-monthly check-ups did not offer any additional benefit in preventing tooth decay or gum bleeding, compared to those whose frequency of check-ups was risk-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-based means dental practitioners set the time between dental check-ups depending on the individual’s risk of dental disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review, which looked at data over four years, also found there wasn’t enough good research to know how different dental check-up schedules affected children’s and teenagers’ teeth and gums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the issue of six-monthly professional cleaning, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004625.pub5"&gt;2018 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; found strong evidence that having regular professional cleaning made little or no difference to signs of gum disease (gingivitis or bleeding gums), or to levels plaque deposits, compared to adults with less regular professional cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a small reduction in tartar levels, however it’s unclear if this is meaningful to consumers and dental practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who had six- or 12-monthly cleans reported their teeth felt cleaner than those who didn’t have scheduled cleans, but there was no difference between groups in reports of quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these reviews, six-monthly visits and cleans don’t seem to consistently lead to better oral health for adults compared to check-ups and cleans based on individual risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So can you forgo six-monthly visits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular professional dental check-ups are important throughout life, starting from the eruption of the first tooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But everyone has different oral health needs and risk levels which should be reflected in the frequency of their check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people who are at high risk of oral disease do need to see a dental practitioner more regularly: every six months or even more often – such as every three months – to treat severe gum disease or tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with good oral health might only need to visit a dental practitioner every year or two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others still may be willing to pay for six-monthly check-ups and cleans for peace of mind, despite their lower oral health risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else can I keep my teeth and gums healthy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintain your oral health by brushing twice a day with fluoridated toothpaste. The evidence shows children and adults who brush less than twice daily are at high risk of tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning between your teeth can also help reduce gum problems and dental plaque – more than brushing alone. You can use traditional dental floss or a flossing tool. Interdental brushes, which have a tiny bristled head that fits between teeth, can also be more effective than flossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who lack manual dexterity and for children, water flossers can be an effective alternative to traditional flossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, avoiding sugars added to foods and drinks, as well as the sugars naturally found in honey, syrups and fruit juices, helps protect teeth from tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HIDALGO COUNTY, Texas (&lt;a href="http://valleycentral.com" data-type="link" data-id="valleycentral.com"&gt;ValleyCentral&lt;/a&gt;) — The Hidalgo County Health and Human Services has issued a warning following the recent outbreak of the Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a statement issued by the Hidalgo County Health and Human Services, over 60 cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease have been reported in four schools in Hidalgo County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hidalgo County Health Authority Dr. Ivan Melendez informs the public that the disease primarily affects children but can spread to adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="btah1kyr" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dr. Melendez explains that the symptoms include fever, chills, a scratchy throat, nausea, and blisters that typically appear on the hands, feet, and mouth by the third day after being infected with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="btah1kyr" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“The most infectious moment is during the first three days, when most people don’t know they even have it, because it’s spread through mucus, droplets, coughing, not washing hands and any bodily fluids,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health experts added that there is no cure for this virus, but doctors will provide symptomatic care by providing medications such as Tylenol and Motrin. Additionally, they will recommend patients to eat easy-to-chew foods such as macaroni and mashed potatoes, as the blisters can cause pain while eating. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Melendez advised that children can go back to school once they have gone a full day without a fever and their blisters are drying out. &lt;/p&gt;

By 85, it strikes one in three. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most patients are still of retirement age or older, but doctors warn the disease is striking Americans younger than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, the number of dementia cases in people under 65 more than doubled between 1990 and 2021. And the risk of developing dementia any time after age 55 is upwards of 40 percent, the latest research shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lesser known forms of the disease like frontotemporal dementia, which tend to affect adults as young as 40, have also become more common in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to Daily Mail at the world's largest dementia conference in July, neurologists warned they are seeing patients younger and younger stepping into their offices, claiming they can no longer keep track of their meeting calendar or remember where they put their keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said part of this &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14663791/symptoms-early-warning-sign-young-onset-dementia.html"&gt;surge in early-onset dementia&lt;/a&gt; could be due to young people getting tested earlier than their parents and grandparents, especially if they have a family history.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they also sounded the alarm about chronic diseases and other lifestyle factors increasingly plaguing young people such as diabetes, obesity, depression and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In one of the most tragic early-onset dementia cases, Robin Williams was found to have been suffering from Lewy body dementia after dying by suicide in 2014 at age 63. He is pictured here with actress Zelda Williams in 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Adrian Owen, a professor of cognitive neuroscience and imaging at the University of Western Ontario in Canada and chief scientific officer at dementia detection company Creyos, told Daily Mail: 'We're seeing people younger, and we're seeing people with different types of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the last 15 or 20 years, we've sort of gone from the focus being squarely on Alzheimer's disease, that's all people used to talk about, to now broad recognition of frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, many different types of dementia, and they present in sometimes subtly different ways.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a range of progressive neurological disorders that impact memory, thinking and behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include memory loss, poor judgment, confusion, repeating questions, difficulty communicating, taking longer to complete normal daily tasks, acting impulsively, and mobility issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease, which affects about 7million Americans, is the most common form, and it typically affects those over 65, with the risk increasing with age. But around 200,000 have early-onset Alzheimer's, the latest research shows.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joel Salinas, adjunct professor of neurology at NYU Langone in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-e69c1000-8cfc-11f0-827f-b725c85fde96"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and Chief Medical Officer of telehealth platform Isaac Health, told Daily Mail that while most people with dementia are diagnosed after age 65, the disease often strikes much earlier before patients realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'We know that these conditions start to develop 10 or even 20 years before you even obviously notice symptoms, and these symptoms are present in a continuum where the earliest symptoms may be really subtle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We want to get better at detecting things where they're in that subtle range.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both doctors told Daily Mail that younger patients who come into their clinics are less likely to come in with stereotypical signs like wandering or forgetting who their loved ones are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mol-fe-xpmodule-comment-cta="true" data-article-id="15022377" data-channel="health" data-environment="production" data-platform="mol.web.desktop" data-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15022377/Dementia-experts-reveal-heartbreaking-trait-new-patients-common.html" data-version="1.1.4" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wendy Williams was diagnosed in 2023 frontotemporal dementia and aphasia at age 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Salinas said: 'Anxiety can give an early presentation. Social isolation can be an early presentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think we're still figuring out whether those symptoms are either tied to having cognitive deficits that are suddenly getting worse, like having difficulty remembering so I'm getting anxious about it, or they're manifestations of the disease in the brain itself.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Younger patients may also notice trouble staying organized at work or around the house, which shows a decline in working memory. Obsessive behaviors are also common&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Salinas also pointed to the example of a writer having trouble coming up with a typical word they would use in a piece and that difficulty worsening over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'If I have a harder time reaching those words, and that's getting worse over time, that actually would be a red flag, kind of like forgetting keys, or walking to a room and not remembering why I walked into the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the key is actually to see are these changes that are persistent and getting worse slowly over time over like six months to a year or two years. Then I would consider that as something that really is a red flag that should be addressed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While much is unknown about why dementia is increasingly affecting younger Americans, lifestyle factors likely play a significant role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13688417/factors-raise-risk-dementia-REVEALED-half-cases-avoided-people-changes-life-experts-say.html"&gt;Lancet Commission study&lt;/a&gt; found about 40 percent of Alzheimer's cases could be tied to 14 modifiable risk factors, including high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a study unveiled at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) in July of 2,000 Americans at risk of dementia found that strict diet and exercise regimens helped them &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14947279/doctors-reveal-simple-lifestyle-changes-prevent-dementia-study.html"&gt;perform significantly better at cognitive tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of these risk factors are on the rise across America, including in young people. CDC data shows the prevalence of obesity, for example, has doubled in adults from 1990 to 2021, and 40 percent of adults are now considered obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above chart shows changes in cognitive scores over time among people who implemented structured changes and those who implemented self-guided ones in the US POINTER study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diabetes prevalence has also increased from about 10 percent in 2000 to 14 percent in 2023, and prevalence among people under 44 has increased about 20 percent in 2024 compared to 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These conditions trigger inflammation throughout the body, including in the brain, that damages cells and promotes the accumulation of toxic proteins that kill brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Owen said: 'I think in the past, dementia was always a really mysterious illness that seemed to just hit some people randomly and not other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now you're seeing more people with cognitive changes and potentially dementia at a younger age. It's almost a byproduct of the fact that younger people are developing diabetes, younger people are getting obese, younger people have anxiety and depression. There are increased levels of mental health challenges that tend to affect young people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mental health is another key factor, he emphasized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CDC data shows the percentage of adults with anxiety symptoms has increased from 16 percent in 2019 to 18 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, depression is up from 10.5 percent in 2015 to about 18 percent in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Owen said: 'There are many other factors in today's world that young people are that are contributing to this sort of cognitive mental health crisis is probably better than epidemic, but I think one of them is anxiety and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'No question, young people are more stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People are worried about their futures. They're worried about their employment. They're worried about their health earlier on. We know stress has detrimental effect on brain functions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Salinas also noted that while lifestyle factors and mental health are at play, he has seen more patients get evaluated for dementia as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I would say we are seeing more and more people who are coming to get evaluated at a younger age, partly because I think [there are] cultural changes around the importance of addressing these issues early.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Owen urged younger Americans who notice issues like trouble focusing, personality changes, issues remembering words and other subtle signs to seek medical care, as early intervention opens the doors for more effective treatments and getting into clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'Early detection is so crucially important. The earlier you get in, the more effective it's going to be.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 18:39:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPdHdHSnRfNlhtR0hsS0Zfc3lvUEYtanU2aHBCTGpFRm5qNnZHaEMzVzgyZmh2bWlMNk1Eekp1alB0VlFzb2QxLVJsZFY5U1dqZG1iRTJnYVhRQ3dNTTZjMTNfZ1BhXzNNaGgxZnFXSHVsUnI5Z2RaZzVtOWlyRXVXbDJYbE5PSG9WMkZfRzlzZ0ZLWGNDS1ZRY2JPUzFPd09MLTlFX2hFb1NDUEl2SGJXS3JNclY3eVNqZzhGY9IBwgFBVV95cUxPUEh2UW9tSjdDaGhYQ1JTOVNUcGlFVXRNSEJ5MUlxTnNLQy1GM0RFb0ExTDJhUF9obmxhaWdUOGhfdENaU0JGRXh6RG0yZHpLako4eFY0bm9lRXA0LVpjTTIteHgzNkRDa0dYVDFZcmw2cVlhUzZOcUduX1g0OHZETjBtZ1NBMWZVdkNMTzVzZnlxYTNLUVdmRUV1djBJc0ZRZlpQT3ROR3JlOHU2OERiN2NxNFBDT1VZWEJnc2pBVjQydw</guid></item><item><title>作为脱发专家，有一种食物我永远不会吃... -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15094913/hair-loss-expert-food-never-eat-causes-balding.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a study last month linked drinking lots of fizzy drinks to hair loss, it underlined the crucial role of diet in a condition affecting millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now experts have revealed other everyday foods that could have a similar effect – including pasta, sliced bread and nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthy hair needs a steady supply of nutrients, and although illness and genetics play a part in hair loss, what people eat and drink can make these factors better – or worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ellie Rashid, consultant dermatologist at the private OneWelbeck clinic, said: ‘Diet is so important. Deficiency of the right nutrients will lead to brittle hair, less hair growing or hair being shed more readily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Iron deficiency, for example, impacts hair growth, while a vitamin D deficiency is linked to hair thinning.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common cause of hair loss is pattern baldness, influenced by genetics and hormones. Another trigger is the autoimmune condition alopecia areata, in which the immune system attacks hair follicles. Dr Rashid believes diet plays a role in both. ‘Many things can cause hair loss, but diet is like a switch that can ramp up the effects of these other factors or dial them down,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recommends blood tests for iron, zinc, vitamin D and folate (vitamin B9), and adopting a balanced diet. Iron can be boosted with red meat, lentils and leafy greens such as spinach and kale. Vitamin D can be topped up with sunlight and supplements and zinc can be increased through supplements and foods such as pumpkin or sesame seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While good foods support healthy hair, evidence suggests others may trigger or accelerate balding. Here, The Mail on Sunday highlights some of the foods that could harm your hair... and those that will give it a boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ellie Rashid is a consultant dermatologist at the private OneWelbeck clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Ditch white bread, cakes and sweets &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Refined carbohydrates include foods high in processed sugar, such as cakes, sweets and fizzy drinks, along with white bread and pasta made from grains stripped of natural fibre. Because they are digested quickly, they cause spikes in blood sugar and insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2016 study in the journal Menopause Review concluded: ‘Consumption of highly processed foods, rich in simple sugars, is one factor causing excess hair loss.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found insulin spikes led to ‘disturbances’ in blood vessels, reducing oxygen supply to the scalp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rashid advises switching from white bread and pasta to wholemeal. She said: ‘Refined carbs are a driver of inflammation. They negatively impact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;cellular processes such as keratin formation – meaning hair doesn’t grow as well as it should.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Don't overdo Brazil nuts  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brazil nuts are rich in selenium, a mineral that supports the thyroid, the immune system and reproductive health – but too much can damage hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Paul Farrant, consultant dermatologist at Experts In Skin And Hair, said: ‘The recommended dose of selenium can come from as little as one brazil nut a day. It’s easy to take too many. Selenium toxicity is linked to brittle hair and disturbs the hair cycle.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Warning over a sandwich favourite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;T, particularly larger species such as yellowfin and bluefin, can contain mercury from feeding on contaminated prey. Mercury can damage the nervous system, the kidneys and even hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Farrant said: ‘It’s not something most of us eat in sufficient quantities to get toxicity, but you can get heavy metal poisoning from tuna. Hair needs good nutrition, and if you add things that are effectively poisons it will affect hair growth and cause hair loss.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The best food for your hair? Eggs! &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;EGGS are among the best foods to nourish healthy locks. Packed with protein and key vitamins, they help keep hair strong and glossy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Farrant said: ‘If you eat lots of eggs, your hair will benefit. Hair is a protein-rich structure, based on keratin, which means you need plenty of protein in your diet to grow strong hair. Eggs are a great source of protein.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also high in vitamin B12 and folate, and are a source of vitamin D, which plays a vital role in the hair growth cycle. ‘If you’re deficient in vitamin D,’ he said, ‘more hairs exit the growing phase and move to the shedding phase.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it doesn’t matter how you cook your eggs, your hair will still reap the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-04d50460-90a8-11f0-8dbe-d3916b45d4e7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15094913/hair-loss-expert-food-never-eat-causes-balding.html"&gt; &lt;font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;IT'S A FACT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;September is considered the worst month for hair shedding, which maybe related to temperature changes &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 16:38:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNTnFENzkwcVZEWlBTVUNCRG56MTZfTGpOU0RGOWRtbEY3ZEFFVkZWUFNOaVpJemFycmVTT2N4aGFLX1haWHhXVG9ISmJTNlowcG5kLVJNME45UERvZXlfbmhDdEJqVlZta2I3VXpmMlM5TFhEdGJxM2QyXzJOeFJ0YWFGZDRKT0hxbmVwbExUU1FaeXpOTkxubW11WU16R293aTJUSEp3</guid></item><item><title>专家敦促美国人了解败血症的迹象- upi.com</title><link>https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2025/09/13/sepsis-signs-awareness/5011757769531/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="stph_caption"&gt;Despite 1.7 million sepsis cases and more than 350,000 deaths each year, experts say Americans don't know what sepsis is or how deadly it can be.

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On World Sepsis Day, health experts remind Americans that sepsis strikes 1.7 million people in the U.S. each year and causes more than 350,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet despite those staggering numbers, many Americans don't know what sepsis is or how to recognize it before it turns deadly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Symptoms can range from rapid breathing, increased rate, fever, chills and sudden drop in blood pressure," Dr. Faisal Masud, medical director of critical care at Houston Methodist, said in a news release. "It's important to share your symptoms with a health care professional as soon as possible as early recognition can make a difference between life and death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is an extreme response to infection. When the immune system overreacts, it triggers widespread inflammation that can damage organs and lead to death. Even a minor infection can set off this dangerous reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, sepsis is responsible for 1 in 10 ICU admissions and remains the leading cause of death in U.S. hospitals, experts say. And most cases begin outside of the hospital, making it essential to spot early warning signs at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors recommend remembering the acronym T.I.M.E.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;T stands for temperature change (such as fever)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I is for infection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;M stands for mental status change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;E is for extremely ill feeling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Symptoms can range from rapid breathing, increased rate, fever, chills and sudden drop in blood pressure," Masud added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can develop sepsis, but certain groups face higher risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children under age 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elderly individuals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with chronic illnesses such as &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/diabetes/diabetes-overview" target="_blank"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, kidney disease, liver disease or cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those with weakened immune systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a medical emergency. Treatment often includes antibiotics and IV fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sharing your symptoms with a medical professional in the emergency room is crucial and even asking the question, 'do I have sepsis?' can make a lifesaving difference," Masud said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7965961/anti-inflammatory-mediterranean-diet-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory Mediterranean meal recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 249 to 373 calories while the lunches span 333 to 488 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_163-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean style of eating is marked by a diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, beans, lean proteins, nuts, seeds, with low to moderate intakes of dairy. It is typically low in saturated fat and added sugars and higher in fiber, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids. Years of research has concluded that following a Mediterranean-style eating pattern reduces the risk of obesity, heart disease, cancer, cognitive decline, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_164-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_165-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a healthy gut microbiome also has many of these same benefits. Data has shown that in addition to helping with constipation and digestion, good gut bacteria may help improve mood, sleep and heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Probiotics—fermented dairy, kimchi, sauerkraut—are foods that contain healthy gut bacteria, while prebiotics—onions, garlic, banana, lentils—are foods that feed good gut bacteria. Furthermore, both a healthy microbiome and the Mediterranean diet are associated with helping maintain a healthy weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

A new line of research points to a simple lever that might lower risk – the color of light reaching our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jthjournal.org/article/S1538-7836(24)00543-9/abstract"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; explores how specific wavelengths shape biology through the body’s daily timing system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call this the circadian clock, a network that tunes hormones, blood pressure, and blood vessel tone across the 24 hour day, as shown in a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5983320/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://providers.upmc.com/provider/elizabeth-ann-andraska/3013812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Andraska, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (&lt;a href="https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UPMC&lt;/a&gt;), and her colleagues asked a basic question. Does the spectrum of visible light change the way blood forms clots in living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-light-color-on-blood-clots"&gt;Testing light color on blood clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a peer reviewed study, the team exposed mice to red, blue, or white light for 12 hours a day over 3 days, then used standard models to trigger clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red light before the challenge led to nearly five times fewer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/red-blood-cells-found-to-squeeze-clots-tight-using-physical-force/"&gt;clots&lt;/a&gt; than blue or white light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study reported no benefit in genetically blind mice, and shining light directly on blood outside the body did not change clotting. That pattern points to an eye to brain pathway rather than a direct effect on blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-clots-and-red-light"&gt;Blood clots and red light&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-platelets-play-a-critically-important-role-in-the-body-that-was-unknown-until-now/"&gt;blood platelets&lt;/a&gt; – the small cell fragments that stick together to stop bleeding and can spark harmful clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red light exposure was linked to lower platelet aggregation and activation, signaling a less reactive clotting profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also tracked neutrophil extracellular traps (&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nri.2017.105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NETs&lt;/a&gt;), which are sticky webs released by white blood cells to capture microbes but also snag platelets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice given red light formed fewer NETs in clots and brain tissue after an induced stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noticed that platelets in the red light group had more healthy fats, including oleic and linoleic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fats are known to make platelets less likely to stick together, which matched the reduced clotting activity they observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the scientists examined &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4369169/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;megakaryocytes&lt;/a&gt;, the bone marrow cells that make platelets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single cell data suggested changes in pathways tied to inflammation, stress responses, and cytoskeletal control, all of which relate to how platelets activate and aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hints-from-human-patients"&gt;Hints from human patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators went a step further and reviewed outcomes in more than 10,000 adults who had cataract surgery with either standard lenses or lenses that filter a slice of blue light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among people with cancer, who face about a ninefold higher clot risk than the general population according to a recent open access &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12001707/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, those with blue light filtering lenses had a lower lifetime risk of venous clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That retrospective signal does not prove cause and effect. It does align with the mouse findings and with prior evidence that clotting biology tracks daily timing cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-means-for-you"&gt;What it means for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research does not replace proven prevention like movement during long trips, anticoagulants when prescribed, or hospital safety protocols. It does raise a precise, testable idea about light and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ginkgo-biloba-plant-may-be-key-to-preventing-blood-clots-vericose-veins/"&gt;clot&lt;/a&gt; biology that clinical trials can evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light is not acting as a drug in the bloodstream. It seems to work through the optic system and brain timing networks, which then influence immune cells and platelets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animal benefit appeared when red light came before the clotting challenge, not after it. That timing suggests a preventive window and warns against over reading the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human biology is more complex than lab models. The lens analysis was observational, so unmeasured variables could explain the signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-think-about-light-in-daily-life"&gt;How to think about light in daily life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clotting problems remain common and deadly, especially after hospitalization and in major illnesses. Even small, safe reductions in risk could help many people if confirmed by trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer amplifies &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-harness-soundwaves-vibrations-to-strengthen-tissues-and-heal-wounds-blood-clots/"&gt;clot&lt;/a&gt; risk for biological reasons that include tumor driven inflammation and pro coagulation signals. Any non drug intervention that safely trims that risk would be worth careful testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most modern environments flood us with short wavelength light from screens and overhead fixtures. The new study suggests wavelength balance might matter, along with timing and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morning light helps set healthy rhythms, while circadian disruption raises cardiovascular strain. That makes lighting a public health question as much as a lab topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expect controlled human studies that standardize wavelength, intensity, timing, and duration. Devices that deliver known doses through the eyes would allow rigorous testing of dose and response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will also map how retinal signals talk to the brain and then to bone marrow and immune cells. Those pathways could reveal new drug targets alongside any light based strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jthjournal.org/article/S1538-7836(24)00543-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 15:46:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNT29fRlZ5NHBwUmRxeDExTi1Nd1RTeTlUM2MyZTY2U1JIX2Q2UFB6X2UtVU5RMnJlZlNPdjVPOG1Oa1B0UzRnVEJWZjV0b2ZzWC00YjBPRGFmcXlEUnB0akxXREQwZENCeDRJMGwyQTFNY0dCNXdLeG9SNUxGTXNRLWZXNlRIZXNacGZBYXJLdDJveGVqRzRUUlQ0cw</guid></item><item><title>地图显示世界上最致命的疾病在美国蔓延-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15082229/maps-reveal-deadliest-disease-tuberculosis-concerning-rise.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For thousands of years it was the biggest health threat in the world - killing actors, poets, kings and emperors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously called phthisis, consumption and even the White Plague, this deadly lung infection is today known as tuberculosis (TB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite sweeping advances in medical care, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-2962a5c0-8f28-11f0-9c9d-bbdf1d2c9bde" class=""&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (WHO) still considers it the deadliest infectious disease on the planet, killing 1.25 million people in 2023 alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB remains a relatively rare threat in the US, infecting several thousand of people annually and killing around 500 - far fewer than heart disease, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-686a67c0-8e7f-11f0-a059-89b046193d55"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, cases are on the rise in 80 percent of US states, and health officials nationwide are now sounding the alarm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In September, three people i&lt;span&gt;n &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maine/index.html" id="mol-250722d0-8e83-11f0-a059-89b046193d55" class=""&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;tested positive for active TB, which means the bacteria responsible for the disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is building up in their lungs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials reported that there was no connection between the patients, suggesting they were all infected from different sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just days later, &lt;span&gt;Leesville Road High School in Raleigh, North Carolina, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15077125/Worlds-deadliest-disease-detected-Maine-spreading-reported-second-state.html"&gt;reported a TB case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, Kansas health officials warned in January that the state was experiencing the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14332367/Tuberculosis-outbreak-Kansas.html"&gt;'the largest documented outbreak in US history&lt;/a&gt;,' with 67 people infected with active TB since the start of 2024, according to the latest figures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Raj Dasgupta, internal medicine physician and Chief Medical Advisor for Sleepopolis, told the Daily Mail: 'Without strong public-health action, we’ll probably continue to see elevated numbers.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Children, older adults and those with weaker immune systems are more vulnerable to the infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the lung infection doesn't always cause symptoms (then called inactive TB), about half of people with untreated active infections will die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, symptoms include a persistent and unexplained cough, sometimes coughing up blood or chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may also suffer from unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, patients may have severe breathing difficulties and extensive lung damage, and the infection may spread to other organs or the back, causing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths are most often due to respiratory failure caused by bacterial damage to the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medical advancements like antibiotics have helped dramatically curb deaths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once killing as many as 20,000 Americans each year in the 1950s, according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), deaths have declined to about 560 per year as of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB was on a steady decline from 1993 until 2020, when the overall number of cases hit an all-time low of 7,170. But in 2021, that number jumped to 7,866.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prevalence has gone up every year since. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest CDC data shows the US provisionally recorded 10,347 TB cases in 2024 - up eight percent from the year before and the highest tally since 2011, when there were 10,471 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above are public health posters from the Work Projects Administration in the 1930s and '40s on getting tested for tuberculosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to 2014, cases nationwide are up 10 percent, CDC data shows.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And experts have warned it is not just one area responsible for the increase. According to the data, TB infections are on the rise in 40 US states and have only declined in 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The District of Columbia is the only jurisdiction to report no change compared to 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maine has reported 28 cases so far this year compared to 39 during all of 2024, which showed a 179 percent increase from the 14 cases in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB cases have risen the most - 187 percent - in Kansas compared to a decade ago. Maine has seen a rise of 179 percent from 2014 to 2024 (14 compared to 39, respectively), while North Carolina reported 250 cases last year compared to 195 in 2014 - a 22 percent increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;California reported the most cases in both 2014 (2,145) and 2024 (2,100), and Texas had the second most with 1,269 in 2014 and 1,238 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In New York, the state with the third-highest prevalence, cases have surged 73 percent over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across Idaho, Vermont and Wyoming, cases are up 100 percent compared to 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors and public health experts told the Daily Mail that the Covid pandemic is likely a main driver in TB's surge, especially considering cases started going up in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In my opinion, early in the pandemic, a lot of clinics focused almost entirely on Covid, which meant TB testing and treatment often got pushed aside,' Dasgupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the same time, masks and social distancing probably helped slow TB spread for a while. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now that most people aren’t masking, and with those earlier delays in diagnosis, we’re seeing cases rise again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria, which cause tuberculosis, are pictured above (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pandemic also forged a growing distrust of doctors and the medical establishment, which Dr Sharon Nachman, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Children's Hospital, said has likely contributed to the rise of TB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One JAMA study found the public's general trust in physicians and hospitals dropped from 71.5 percent in April 2020 to 40 percent in January 2024. Experts have suggested the change is likely due to concerns over vaccine mandates and Big Pharma's financial gains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nachman told the Daily Mail: 'I believe the erosion of public health funding and the publicity around "medical myths" being true has led to people not seeing their medical providers and not following standard guidelines or even going back for follow-up care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This translates into poor care for our population and delays in preventing TB infection from progressing to TB disease (meaning intrathoracic or lung disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This delay then translates into a person having an easily treatable infection to having a disease that transmits to their family and friends, leading to more cases of TB.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The demographics of TB began to shift in 2001. That was the first year the CDC reported more non-US born citizen patients than US-born, meaning immigrants and travelers were the driving force behind infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dasgupta said international travel and migration play a role as many of those cases were linked to folks who had recently come from places where TB is more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is a chest X-ray showing signs of tuberculosis. Doctors told the Daily Mail that paying attention to early symptoms is key for preventing spread (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;International travel further surged starting around 2021, after the height of the Covid pandemic, which Nachman said could have further driven the increase as Americans ventured abroad and foreign relatives made Stateside visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The longer you stay and come into contact with an infected adult, the more likely you are to get infected yourself,' Nachman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, infections are linked to significant, long-term exposure over months or years, so one international trip abroad likely is not enough to bring TB back to the states, she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis can be prevented with the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. Though, due to the generally low risk, it is not routinely offered in the US - except for to children regularly exposed to people with active TB or healthcare workers in areas with increased spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s not recommended here because of its variable effectiveness against adult pulmonary TB and because it can interfere with TB skin test results,' Dasgupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In developing countries, the vaccine is administered to children younger than 16. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As cases rise, Dasgupta urged Americans to 'pay attention to symptoms' before they progress so antibiotics can be administered and potential spread can slow.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you’ve had a cough for more than a couple weeks, or unexplained weight loss, fevers, or night sweats, get checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And if you are diagnosed, stick with treatment until the end. Stopping early can lead to drug resistance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Ocala grandmother claims a local healthcare provider did not diagnose her breast cancer for several months, allowing the disease to advance to Stage IV while she awaited an appointment for imaging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attorneys representing Shonte D. Page filed the lawsuit against the University of Central Florida College of Medicine Graduate Medical Education Program and Heart of Florida Health Center in the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Orange County on September 5. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Page noticed a small lump in the upper left quadrant of her left breast in early March 2023. After she noticed the lump, Page allegedly scheduled a visit with her primary care practice at Heart of Florida Health Center. The lawsuit does not specify which Heart of Florida Health Center location Page visited. It does list her as a resident of Marion County. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Page says that on her first visit, she was seen by UCF resident Dr. Manal El-Hag for an evaluation of the lump. The complaint alleges the appointment was on  March 24, 2023, which was the “first available office visit.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During that appointment, which was under the supervision of family practitioner Dr. Jennifer Abernathy, Dr. El-Hag noted that a “non-tender one (1) cm mass” could be felt upon examination of Page’s breast.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The doctor noted that Page had a “family history of breast cancer” and documented that a “mammogram and ultrasound” were ordered, according to the complaint. The following week, when Page attempted to schedule an appointment at the Advanced Imaging Centers as she was instructed, the facility advised her that they had “not yet received any orders” from the health center. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the two ensuing weeks, Page claims she repeatedly contacted Heart of Florida and had to “wait on return calls.” The complaint notes that the two weeks “encompassed the Easter holiday.” Page claims that she was eventually told “someone would look into” her case and “get back to her.” The complaint alleges the individual expressed that there was “no urgency” and that she was “scheduled to be re-seen in the office in just another week or two anyway.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On April 17, 2023, Page visited Heart of Florida for a second scheduled appointment. She was seen by a different resident, Dr. Hira Hussain, with the same supervising physician (Abernathy). Page claims Dr. Hussain’s records from that day clearly describe the grandmother’s concerns with not having undergone the “imaging studies.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The complaint further alleges that Dr. Hussain’s notes show that an electronic order “had never been sent” to the Advanced Imaging Centers. The note indicates that the “orders would be ‘resent today.'” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the exam with Dr. Hussain, the doctor identified a “large, firm mass” in Page’s left breast that was the size of a “half dollar.” According to the complaint, the mass had tripled in size since the previous exam, when it had been measured at the size of a penny. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Page’s attorneys allege that the doctors “did not institute new imaging orders of their own” at that point, and instead, faxed over the original order from March 24 to the Advanced Imaging Centers. As a result, despite what was now an “urgent situation,” the order contained “no instructions for the stat need for breast imaging studies.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Page claims she was “reassured” there was “no concern with the imaging delay and no sense of urgency.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Despite the finding of a firm, palpable breast mass that had now rapidly enlarged between the two office visits, neither Dr. El-Hag, Dr. Hussain, nor Dr. Abernathy made a referral to a general surgeon for tissue biopsy of the mass in conjunction with the planned imaging,” reads the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Page says that, because the order contained no instructions on timing or expediency, Advanced Imaging Centers placed her “in a queue” that scheduled her surgery for July 2023, around three months after her second visit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After being told of the delay, Page reached out to Heart of Florida for further assistance and claims she was given none. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On May 16, 2023, Page returned to Heart of Florida for a third visit for her breast lump and was again seen by Dr. Hussain. During this visit, the resident doctor was being supervised by a different doctor (Dr. Elvira S. Mercado). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In reviewing Page’s chart during that visit, Hussain apparently acknowledged that the group had never “made the orders stat” for her imaging. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the status was changed on the order, Page claims the old order originally written by Dr. El-Hag was once again faxed to Advanced Imaging Centers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the third examination of Page’s breast on May 16, 2023, Dr. Hussain noted that the lump was “getting even larger and was now painful.” At the time, Page expressed concerns that the lump was impacting her ability to work “as a caretaker herself.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Hussain and Dr. Mercado took no additional measures. They did not assure that the imaging be procured stat, nor did they contact a surgeon to assure that the breast lump be biopsied,” reads the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Page says that, after “much frustration, concern, and fear,” she made calls to other radiology facilities to try and get an appointment sooner than July 2023. She claims she was eventually successful in getting an appointment at Radiology Associates of Ocala Women’s Imaging Center on June 16, 2023. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A mammogram taken that day revealed a mass in Page’s breast that had now grown to 5.4 centimeters in its “greatest dimension,” according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Heart of Florida’s knowledge, an attempt was made to “aspirate fluid from the lesion” in Page’s breast using “ultrasound guidance” on July 7, 2023. The complaint notes that the “needle aspiration of fluid was difficult” and the limited procedure “did not identify malignant cells.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Page says the pathologist noted a biopsy was needed since the mass remained. Page claims that Heart of Florida received this information, “yet continued to fail to obtain a surgical tissue biopsy” for her. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the next two months following the aspiration, Page began to experience “local and systemic signs of infection” as the breast mass took on a “virulent inflammatory course, producing infection, abscesses and ulcerated tissue tracks throughout her breast.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She claims she required hospitalization and, believing she had “already been adequately worked up by her primary care providers who told her she only had a breast cyst,” she asked to initially concentrate on treating her infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On September 30, 2023, a surgical tissue biopsy was obtained at AdventHealth Ocala Hospital, approximately six months after Page first reported her breast mass to Heart of Florida. That biopsy confirmed an “invasive ductal carcinoma,” which is a form of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the six weeks after receiving the diagnosis, Page claims she continued having problems with inflammation and infection “until a left breast mastectomy could be performed on November 27, 2023.” The complaint alleges the mastectomy was the “first definitive treatment for [Page’s] cancer,” coming approximately eight months after she first reported her breast lump to Heart of Florida. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The staging workup following the diagnosis revealed that Page’s cancer had “advanced to Stage IV with metastasis to lymph nodes and distant organs.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Page began chemotherapy in January 2024, but claims she was already in a “weakened and debilitated” condition from the “advancing metastatic process in her body.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For over one year, she has since endured grueling adjuvant cancer treatments and associated complications from having to battle a cancer that was allowed to grow rapidly and unchecked for months in 2023, becoming aggressive and inflammatory in nature, and eventually disseminating throughout her tissues – all while under the eyes of her primary care physicians at Heart of Florida,” reads a portion of the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Page claims that the health center’s negligence deprived her of an earlier diagnosis that may have carried a “more favorable prognosis.” The complaint alleges that Page’s diagnosis reduces her “likelihood of 5-year survival to below 50%.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her attorneys claim Page’s pain, suffering, “and now grim prognosis” could have been prevented with an earlier diagnosis. They say it has “deeply impacted every aspect of” Page’s life and has devastated her family, of which she is the matriarch. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It has devastated not only for Ms. Page, but her children and entire family, who have been deprived of the immeasurable joys, love and support they looked forward to sharing in the years ahead, and to which they were entitled,” according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Page is seeking over $50,000 in damages, exclusive of attorney’s fees and costs. She is being represented by Searcy Denney Scarola Barnhart &amp;amp; Shipley, PA, of West Palm Beach. &lt;/p&gt;
