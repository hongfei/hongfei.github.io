So, when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-853857c0-2f40-11f0-a288-bfe0bf43e896"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, her world was turned upside down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the 36-year-old mother of two was determined to beat her diagnosis - which has a survival rate of 13 percent - and she 'hit the ground running' and started an aggressive chemotherapy regimen in May 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she's been been hit with painful side effects and medical bills that could exceed half a million dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her husband, Corey Candrilli, a disabled US Army combat veteran said: 'I don’t understand exactly what she’s going through, but I understand pain. I understand the highs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's amazing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her diagnosis, Mrs Candrilli has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy and multiple surgeries to try and remove tumors, but her fight isn't over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Candrilli said his wife's delayed diagnosis - she visited multiple doctors and had her symptoms dismissed - puts a spotlight on the need for a law that would require insurance companies to cover colonoscopies for younger patients with certain symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colonscopies are the gold standard for screening for the disease, which is on the rise in young people across the US. They are typically recommended to begin at 45 and occur every 10 years so long as results are normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, lack of - and confusion over - insurance coverage has led people to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14556451/reason-colon-cancer-cases-rising-colonoscopy-charges.html"&gt;delay screening or has burdened them with bills for thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heather Candrilli is a mom-of-two who was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last May&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Candrilli has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy and multiple surgeries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On most insurance plans, the procedure should cost on average $79 out-of-pocket, with health insurers footing the rest of the about $2,125 bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But recently, patients have come forward to say they've been charged upward of $5,000, $7,000 and even $20,000 for the procedure, despite having health insurance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple live in New York, where the law requires insurance coverage for colonoscopies only for people 45 and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can’t get it. It’s unbelievable,’' Mr Candrilli &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.silive.com/news/2025/05/amazing-young-mother-battles-stage-4-colon-cancer-after-delayed-diagnosis.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; SI Live of colonoscopies before 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s truly unbelievable. These are your teachers, your parents, people raising your children. These are our future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The army veteran said his wife had been experiencing bloating and abdominal pain but, 'when you're about that age, you're busy rising a family, and the last thing you're going to be thinking about is yourself.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Candrilli was tested for the chronic autoimmune diseases crohn's and celiac, but the couple said a colonoscopy was never suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, an ultrasound of Mrs Candrilli's stomach detected something on her liver, then a colonoscopy was performed, which revealed an aggressively growing tumor that had spread to other parts of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Candrilli said: 'As soon as they ordered the colonoscopy, they saw the tumor right there on her colon.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cory Candrilli, an army veteran, said his wife had been experiencing bloating and abdominal pain but a colonoscopy was never suggested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After undergoing 20 rounds of chemotherapy, Mrs Candrilli is awaiting a liver transplant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Candrilli underwent surgery to remove a portion of her colon and is now awaiting a liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her initial surgery, she has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy, which her husband said are shrinking the tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These sessions required her to spend four hours in the hospital every two weeks to receive the medication and then wear an external device that continued delivering chemotherapy to her for 48 hours after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while the treatments are working, Mr Candrilli said the family cannot keep up with medical bills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It’s ridiculously expensive. Insurance is helpful, but we’ve been told that, even with insurance, this can go up to at least $500,000.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A GoFundMe account has been set up to help the family with medical bills as Mrs Candrilli stopped working as a nanny before becoming a mother and supporting her husband after he suffered a traumatic brain injury in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told SI Live: 'She's the greatest medicine I've ever had my whole life.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 67 percent of adults adhere to current screening requirements, below the US government target of at least 70 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer often causes no symptoms until it has spread to other areas of the body, where it becomes harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But warning signs can include trouble using the bathroom, blood in feces and persistent diarrhea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Candrilli is mom to the Candrillis' two sons, Lucas, 2, and James, 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors fear that, faced with the risk of high prices, patients may put off any screenings — which can find pre-cancerous growths and eliminate them, slashing the risk of developing the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also put off screenings even when they have symptoms, risking the cancer reaching an advanced stage — making it harder to treat and deadlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, told DailyMail.com: 'The majority of people who do preventative screening should have very little out-of-pocket cost, regardless of where they go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But there are horror stories, with the exception being when someone goes out of network for their physical or hospital.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If patients are putting off colonoscopies worrying about costs, then this means these aren't removed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Screening reveals benign polyps that aren't cancer, but by removing them we are reducing the risk of cancer developing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you put off screening and don't do anything, there's certainly a much higher probability that when you go in, you have symptoms,' which may raise the risk of being diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 04:03:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新的人工智能工具通过自拍来预测您的生物学年龄-《华盛顿邮报》 | New AI tool predicts your biological age from a selfie - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPc3pyNFE2RFpsek52Vk5PeG45M3RSU2IwTkdLZlpVOWczY2F4amd1YTRnTWVDejNqQ1BuRTAwLThHNVkwTHdzZElraktEWjh1QnhxNDNkRDJzNGNKZk5ZZ0d3UTQ5aUpQamJGOFdtcmF0dlNqWWEyel92NlA4eUdoem1DVzRyUHF3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FSRQZLKAGJE2ZJF4ISTPLMEQAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Our faces suggest our true age and even how much time we may have left on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J6QUJNK4MJGBJIISLWHBKAHZUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While doctors learn to form a picture of a patient’s health from their face, using what they call “the eyeball test,” new research in the Lancet Digital Health indicates that this may be a job that artificial intelligence can enhance in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FEWBTVCIB5GC5E56CWD5UIFUEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists at Mass General Brigham in Boston have developed and carried out some initial testing of an&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;AI tool called FaceAge, an algorithm designed to tell patients’ biological age from a photograph as simple as a selfie ― not how old they are in years, but how old they are in health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QS2FDN7R6JCWXD3734PAB5X3AU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Biological age is considered crucial in helping doctors determine the most appropriate therapy, such as whether a cancer patient is healthy enough to tolerate an aggressive treatment. FaceAge requires more testing before doctors can begin using it routinely, but scientists said that in the next week or two, they expect to begin enrolling about 50 patients in a pilot study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6FFVQLR3HNC7RK7OH4B3ZQKGDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers said they trained FaceAge using about 59,000 photographs of people ages 60 and older who were presumed to be healthy. Most of the photos were publicly available on Wikipedia and the internet movie database IMDb, while some came from UTKFace, a large-scale dataset with pictures of people from less than a year old to 116 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZO35VDMIAVBQRPIF76DUXSLW6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The developers of FaceAge tested it on a group of 6,200 cancer patients, using photographs taken at the start of radiotherapy treatment. The algorithm determined that when it came to their health, cancer patients were, on average, about five years older than their chronological age. Moreover, the tool found that the older their faces looked, the worse their survival outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IZXK4EGFVNBQVDQF6ZIVDQIQJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists then conducted an experiment in which they asked eight doctors to determine whether terminal cancer patients would be alive in six months based first on the patient’s photograph alone, then on the photograph and clinical information, and finally based on FaceAge and clinical information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5NXZOYI2MNAZTFFVYRRQEKHLGQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We found that doctors on average can predict life expectancy with an accuracy that’s only a little better than a coin flip,” when using a photo alone for their analysis, said Raymond Mak, a radiation oncologist at Mass General Brigham and one of the lead investigators for the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WHMBOEURPFDAXBYHONMN3LMZME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When using a photo alone, the doctors were right about 61 percent of the time.

class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you’ve been sniffling, sneezing, rubbing your itchy eyes and wondering: What is going on this year?! Well, here’s the not-so-great news—seasonal allergies are brutal in 2025.And if you’re living in certain parts of the U.S., it’s like walking into a pollen storm every time you step outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this happening? Two words: climate change. Warmer temperatures and more CO₂ mean longer growing seasons, which means more pollen. Add to that a bit of pollution and urbanization, and you’ve got yourself the perfect sneeze-fest. Pollen becomes stickier, stays in the air longer, and triggers stronger reactions than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious which cities are leading the pack in allergy misery this year? The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) dropped its annual list, and well… let’s just say, some cities are definitely not doing your sinuses any favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Top 10 worst US cities for pollen in 2025&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Wichita, Kansas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wichita takes the top spot for the third year in a row. The combo of open plains, heavy pollen winds, and not-so-great access to allergists makes this city an allergy sufferer’s nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. New Orleans, Louisiana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jumped a whopping 30 spots since last year. Why? That warm, sticky, humid weather means pollen basically never takes a day off. Plus, recent hurricanes added even more moisture—pollen’s BFF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree and grass pollen are off the charts. Add in one of the highest over-the-counter allergy med usage rates in the country, and it’s clear: people here are struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Tulsa, Oklahoma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same deal as Oklahoma. High pollen counts, lots of meds being used, and a big ol’ bowl of allergy soup in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;5. Memphis, Tennessee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grass and weed pollen are worse than average here, and people are loading up on allergy meds left and right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;6. Little Rock, Arkansas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triple threat: tree, grass, and weed pollen. Even with decent access to allergy specialists, it’s a rough ride for sensitive noses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;7. Raleigh, North Carolina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raleigh’s got all three pollen types in full swing—and fewer allergy doctors per capita, which doesn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;8. Richmond, Virginia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pollen levels across the board, though slightly better access to specialists means folks have some support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;9. Greenville, South Carolina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grass and weed pollen are the main culprits here. Med use is high, so clearly people are feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;10. Greensboro, North Carolina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree, grass, and weed pollen are worse than average here too, making outdoor activities feel like punishment for anyone with allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can you actually do about it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live in one of these cities (or even nearby), don’t panic. You’re not doomed to a life of tissues and antihistamine fog. Here’s how to fight back against the pollen army:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start your meds early: Don’t wait until you’re already a sniffly mess. Get a jump start with antihistamines before peak season hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your windows shut: Yes, even if the weather’s perfect. Run the AC instead—it filters the air and keeps pollen out of your house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shower when you come in: Pollen loves to cling to skin and hair. Give yourself a rinse after being outside, especially during high-pollen hours (usually morning and early evening).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the pollen forecast: Sites like Pollen.com or even your weather app give you daily pollen updates. Plan your outdoor time when counts are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to an allergist: Seriously, don’t suffer in silence. A specialist can set you up with a treatment plan, which may include allergy testing or even long-term solutions like immunotherapy (a.k.a. allergy shots).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The content in this article is intended for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

			&lt;p&gt;Ever felt like a song really resonates with you? That may be more true than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new theory suggests that we don't just listen to it; our bodies physically resonate with music, as our brains' natural oscillations synchronize with structures like rhythm and pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is often thought of as a '&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/music-could-be-a-universal-language-we-all-understand"&gt;universal language&lt;/a&gt;' – people across cultures will bust out similar moves, and young kids will instinctively bop to a beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to neural resonance theory, it's not just that we learn to expect and predict what's coming; aspects like harmony in the music we make and enjoy sound&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/music-sends-a-pleasurable-chill-through-the-brain-and-scientists-can-see-it"&gt; so good to us&lt;/a&gt; because they're in sync with the brain's resonant patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This theory suggests that music is powerful not just because we hear it, but because our brains and bodies become it," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/study-suggests-we-dont-just-hear-music-become-it-365203"&gt;says Caroline Palmer&lt;/a&gt;, neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada. "That has big implications for therapy, education, and technology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not a coincidence, of course. As humans messed around with music over millennia, we figured out what sounds best without necessarily understanding why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural resonance theory (NRT) has now been formally described by Palmer and co-authors in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;perspective paper&lt;/a&gt; reviewing the literature on musical neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160576" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160576" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-642x370.jpg" alt="Music Literally Resonates With Our Brain Rhythms, New Theory Says" class="wp-image-160576 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-642x370.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-720x415.jpg 720w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-768x443.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-1536x886.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-600x346.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2.jpg 1809w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160576" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human brain oscillations synchronize with musical structures. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key suggestions of NRT is that neural oscillations synchronize with external audio at different rates. On the slower end of the timescale is what we call rhythm, with distinct beats you can dance or bang a drum to. Neurons in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"&gt;cortex&lt;/a&gt; oscillate at frequencies that resonate with those pulses in the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher frequencies, from about 30 to over 4,000 Hertz, are perceived as pitch. Gamma-frequency oscillations in the cortex sync up with the lower end of that, while the auditory nerve, brain stem, and cochlea resonate at the higher pitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all comes together to make music pleasurable regardless of musical background – from young children to classically trained pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Statistically universal structures may have arisen in music because they correspond to stable states of complex, pattern-forming dynamical systems," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that there's no learned factor to appreciating music; the team says that aspects like pulse and more complex structures like meter can vary widely based on culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple pulses, like one you might clap to or bounce a baby on your knee to, develop more quickly and become stronger over time, but more complex structures are culture-specific. Over time, the brain oscillations showed bias towards those learned structures, called attunement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other aspects covered by NRT include groove, which is basically the urge to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/music-humans-cant-even-hear-makes-us-dance-more-experiment-shows"&gt;move your body to music&lt;/a&gt;. When a beat doesn't follow a predictable pulse but falls between pulses to a degree, the brain has to fill in the blanks – which the team calls nonlinear resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"High groove ratings" required just the right amount of this nonlinear resonance. Of course, music that's too disjointed isn't groovy enough to dance to either. Understandably, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hit-songs-do-something-to-your-brain-and-it-could-be-the-future-of-music"&gt;pop music&lt;/a&gt; tends to fall right in the middle of that range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also explores how NRT explains various other aspects of music, and what we can learn by applying it to this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-adorable-sea-lion-can-keep-a-beat-better-than-some-humans"&gt;universal joy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"NRT can provide insights into both neuroscience and human behavior, as well as the link between the two," the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;researchers write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Such insights can shed light on the interconnectedness of brain and body, the ability of music to communicate affect and emotion, the role of music in interpersonal bonding, and applications of music to brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perspective was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Reviews Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Is it OK to mix and match meals if there’s one I don’t like?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18003/lifestyle-diets/vegan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based recipes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 359 to 419 calories while the lunches span 354 to 496 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item " data-ordinal="3"&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200 calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_192-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plant-based diets are linked with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;number of health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. They’re particularly beneficial for heart health since they tend to be low in saturated fat and high in fiber. Plant-based diets can also help lower your risk of type 2 diabetes and certain kinds of cancers.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The fiber, antioxidants and other nutrients in plant foods help promote a healthy gut microbiome, which improves insulin sensitivity, reduces inflammation and supports gut health.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t have to cut out animal products entirely to reap these benefits. For example, the Mediterranean diet includes small amounts of dairy, eggs, fish and poultry, and it’s linked with loads of health benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, prioritizing plant foods can make a difference when it comes to your health.

Pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's happening? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers from the Barrow Neurological Institute tracked Parkinson's diagnoses in Olmsted County, Minnesota, over a 24-year span, cross-referencing patient addresses with the locations of 139 nearby golf courses. The &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/residential-proximity-golf-courses-linked-parkinsons-disease-2025a1000bau" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; revealed a clear pattern: the closer someone lived to a golf course, the higher their odds of developing Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And it's not just air exposure. Residents whose tap water came from groundwater sources near a golf course had nearly double the risk of developing the disease. Those living in "vulnerable groundwater regions" — where rainwater can carry chemicals through porous bedrock more easily — faced even greater odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This isn't about golf," said Dr. Michael Okun, national medical adviser for the Parkinson's Foundation. "It's about pesticides, environmental exposures, and preventable risks hiding in plain sight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this concerning? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Parkinson's disease is a serious progressive condition that impacts movement, speech, and cognitive function. There's no cure — and cases are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As Newsweek &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/parkinsons-disease-linked-golf-courses-new-study-2070602" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:covered;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Okun recently posted to X, formerly Twitter, saying, "Parkinson's cases are exploding. We now face 11.8 million cases globally, and the numbers are climbing fast. Despite this reality, we still spend just 2 to 3 cents of every Parkinson's dollar on prevention. That has to change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While genetics do play a role, environmental factors like pesticide exposure are increasingly being linked to the disease. Chemicals such as paraquat and rotenone — often used to maintain lush greens — have been shown to trigger Parkinson-like symptoms in animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And the U.S. has pesticide risks up to 15 times higher on golf courses than &lt;a href="https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2023/03/pesticide-dangers-at-golf-courses-much-higher-in-the-us-than-europe-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:European countries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;European countries&lt;/a&gt; do, according to Beyond Pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting our outdoor environments, especially in urban and suburban areas, may not be as safe as they seem — especially when aesthetics are prioritized over health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's being done about it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the study doesn't explicitly call for people to move away from golf courses, experts say there's a clear need to reevaluate how pesticides are used in public spaces. Cities and states can take action by tightening regulations on chemical applications near residential areas and upgrading municipal water treatment in high-risk zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For those living near golf courses, consider reaching out to local environmental health agencies to learn about pesticide transparency laws and groundwater safety initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As Dr. Okun noted, "This is a warning we can't ignore.

        &lt;hr class="custom-gradient-background my-6 h-[6px] max-w-[75px] border-0"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Skinny” is such an outdated concept; too diet culture for 2025. “Flat belly” sounds better, but we’re tired of that, too. What is the trend-dependent online influencer culture to do? Enter “gut health,” the current euphemism for having a thin waist—this time with extra wellness baggage. It &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; like it’s all about a science-based journey toward better nutrition, but really it’s more bullshit. So let’s explore the most questionable gut health hacks out there. Grab a towel, because it’s time for your internal shower!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="taking-an-internal-shower"&gt;Taking an 'internal shower'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "internal shower" is meant to clean you from the inside. The metaphor evokes more than just relieving constipation, and implies that your guts are dirty and need to be made sparkling clean. That's not how gut health works—things should keep moving, sure, but there's no need to fully clean everything out unless you're preparing for a colonoscopy (which has its own protocol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though “internal shower” sounds fancy, it's really just a drink that contains two full tablespoons of chia seeds, plus a squeeze of lemon. Chia seeds swell in water, forming a lumpy, gel-like texture. (This is both what makes them good in pudding, and what allows them to adhere to the terra-cotta planters of &lt;a data-ga-click="1" data-ga-template="Opinions" data-ga-module="content_body" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-event_label="Chia Pet" href="https://zdcs.link/QVX4K3?pageview_type=Standard&amp;amp;template=Opinions&amp;amp;module=content_body&amp;amp;element=offer&amp;amp;item=text-link&amp;amp;element_label=Chia%20Pet&amp;amp;short_url=QVX4K3&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fsilliest-gut-health-trends&amp;amp;event_label=Chia%20Pet" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"&gt;Chia Pet&lt;/a&gt; fame.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why drink them? Well, they’re high in fiber, and you also consume a glass of water in the process. In other words, it’s a trendier version of Metamucil. Be warned: the sudden increase of fiber in your diet can lead to bloating and diarrhea if you’re not used to it, but isn’t likely to be harmful otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="avoiding-cheese"&gt;Avoiding cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that a diverse diet with plenty of plant foods is probably better for your gut than a crappy diet—but not for any game-changing, gut-specific reason. Your gut is healthy when your body is healthy, and a varied diet involving fiber and other nutrients is good for your gut microbes and for the rest of you. This amounts to “eat your vegetables,” and is thus not an exciting viral tip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut health advice often gives you a list of foods not to eat, or demonizes specific foods. There are no common foods known to be particularly destructive to gut health—we're built to handle just about anything—but influencers often target processed foods and dairy foods. This means that cheese has emerged as a mythically problematic food, when in fact it's probably fine—and &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250303/Cheese-isnt-just-foode28094ite28099s-a-microbiome-booster-study-confirms.aspx" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;some studies suggest that it may even be particularly beneficial.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="taking-l-glutamine"&gt;Taking L-glutamine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of “gut health” has led influencers to tell you that you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to go out and get some L-glutamine (available in any store’s supplement aisle) to heal or prevent your leaky gut. Some of these videos include actual scientific facts about what we understand glutamine to do in the body. But that itself should set off alarm bells: When somebody talks about the mechanism of how something is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to work, without presenting data on whether it &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; works for the intended outcome, chances are you’re on the wrong path. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L-glutamine is an amino acid that our body can usually make for itself. There is evidence that supplementing it is helpful for people with serious bowel diseases, sepsis, injuries like extensive burns, and immune disorders. The Canadian Society for Intestinal Research &lt;a href="https://badgut.org/information-centre/health-nutrition/glutamine/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that you should consult a physician if you think you have conditions serious enough to affect your body’s ability to make enough glutamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anything-called-an-elixir"&gt;Anything called an "elixir" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s an incredible depth and breadth of "gut health elixir" recipes available on TikTok and other platforms. There are gut health elixirs with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danalholden/video/7132270278515789102" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;aloe juice and coconut water&lt;/a&gt;, or with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pamicakess/video/7476892094813113646" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;olive oil and lemon&lt;/a&gt;, or with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@emselement/video/7262353622904786222" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;hibiscus and kombucha&lt;/a&gt;, or with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eatplantswithalana/video/7455452717121817902" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;turmeric and ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt;. What do any of these have in common? Gut health, of course. What a silly question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="washing-our-fruit-for-gut-health"&gt;Washing our fruit (for gut health)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washing your fruit is fine. Believing that unwashed fruit is the only thing standing between you and a snatched stomach—that I can't get behind. The idea is that fresh produce has pesticides on it, and those pesticides are killing your good gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; a good idea to &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/wash-all-your-fruit-even-the-kind-you-peel-1844248118" target=""&gt;rinse fruit before you eat it&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s no link between the barely-detectable trace amounts of pesticides on fruit and the health of your gut or the size of your waistline. This isn’t a gut health tip, it’s just sensible food prep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="pilates-for-gut-health"&gt;Pilates (for gut health)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilates is low-key strength training. It can be good for you, as almost any exercise can, but it doesn't work miracles. I've already covered &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/why-do-so-many-tiktok-influencers-want-us-to-do-pilates-1849072506" target=""&gt;the trend of TikTok influencers making up imaginary benefits of Pilates&lt;/a&gt;, but “gut health” is a stretch. Influencers claim (as in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@darcieratcliff/video/7237160382400400666" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;) that the breathwork and twisting motions of Pilates "massage" your gut to cure constipation, sometimes also referencing the &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/tiktok-gut-health-trend-1850844490" target="_blank"&gt;complete myth&lt;/a&gt; that we have pounds of "stuck" poop inside our guts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pogoClear relative my-10 border-b-[1.5px] border-t-[1.5px] border-dashed border-black py-5 sm:my-14 sm:border-0 sm:py-0" data-ga-click data-ga-template="Opinions" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-cloak x-data="{ commentsCount: null, hasComments: false }" x-init="commentsCount = await window.openweb.getMessagesCount(01JV31AQ0WPNGQ1D1R9YESP272);

            &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eating-30-plants-a-day"&gt;Eating 30 plants a day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually like this as a hack for increasing the diversity of your diet: count up the number of plant species you eat each week, and aim to get more than you currently do. Lettuce and tomato on your sandwich? Add the wheat from the bun and you’re already up to three. This idea got its start with &lt;a href="https://www.wcrf-uk.org/our-blog/could-you-eat-30-plant-based-foods-each-week/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;research from the American Gut Project&lt;/a&gt;, which found people who ate a more varied diet had a more diverse gut microbiome—although there is no specific link to health, and scientists still haven’t found a way of determining what a “healthy” microbiome looks like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all of that has mutated quite a bit on social media. In one clip I remember watching, the narrator tells us that the difference between her before and after pictures is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; due to “cardio and a restrictive diet.” But she has clearly lost fat. Gut health is just the new code word for losing fat. Nearly every one of the videos I’ve highlighted here starts with a before-and-after of somebody’s soft, then toned, tummy. If it were really about “bloating,” you’d be able to see the same abs in both pictures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="going-for-a-walk-every-morning"&gt;Going for a walk every morning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walks are good! Morning routines are good! And it’s true that your gut has its own “clock” for telling what time it is. Some influencers get it backwards, though, when they suggest getting morning light to set your gut’s clock. In truth, the gut sets its clock &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867408010672" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;based on when you feed it&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to set your gut’s clock in the morning, try eating breakfast. Like a whole, actual breakfast, not a glass of &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/lemon-water-doesn-t-do-anything-1822932908" target=""&gt;lemon water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going for a walk may help your digestion—that's the whole idea of the "fart walk," a walk taken after dinner that &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/what-is-a-fart-walk" target="_blank"&gt;may relieve feelings of bloating&lt;/a&gt; and that can also help your body to control glucose levels. Feel free to take one after breakfast instead of waiting until dinnertime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="oil-pulling"&gt;Oil pulling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; old thing? (I need to stop being surprised when old health trends make a comeback.) Oil pulling is when you swish coconut oil around your mouth, sometimes for up to 20 minutes, in addition to (or in place of) brushing your teeth. &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/oil-pulling-doesnt-out-clean-mouthwash-or-cure-all-you-1687355453" target=""&gt;It’s not particularly good at that job&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s no reason to believe it will &lt;em&gt;do anything for your gut health or your abs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="chewing"&gt;Chewing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another archaic one that keeps popping up. The idea of over-chewing your food always reminds me of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wmimhqPHkc" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;that scene in &lt;em&gt;The Road to Wellville&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where the dining hall erupts in a chorus of “Chew chew chew, that is the thing to do/Chew chew chew, good food is good for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, your mouth produces salivary amylase to help break down your food. But there is plenty of amylase in your small intestine as well. Studies have shown potential, subtle effects of extended chewing on satiety (how hungry you feel), but the idea that you’ll get a TikTok flat belly by spending more time chewing is unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;May 12 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; U.S. health officials are advising patients using the drug Ixchiq to hold off while authorities seek newer information on vaccine results in the global fight against chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pause for U.S. patients was initiated Friday by the FDA and CDC while the two federal agencies investigate "postmarketing reports of serious adverse events, including neurologic and cardiac events, in individuals who have received the vaccine" Ixchiq, otherwise known as live "Chikungunya Vaccine," according to a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/fda-and-cdc-recommend-pause-use-ixchiq-chikungunya-vaccine-live-individuals-60-years-age-and-older" target="_blank"&gt;safety communication&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Food_and_Drug_Administration/" target="_blank" title="Food and Drug Administration" class="tpstyle"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2023, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2023/11/10/FDA-vaccine-chikungunya-virus/8071699627394/" target="_blank"&gt;approved Ixchiq for&lt;/a&gt; the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in patients age 18 years and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, health officials said the FDA will conduct an updated benefit-risk assessment for the use of Ixchiq in individuals 60 years of age and older after over 80,000 doses of Ixchiq were distributed worldwide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the start of this year, roughly 80,000 cases and 46 CHIKVD-related deaths have been reported in 14 countries or territories, &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/chikungunya-monthly#:~:text=Twelve-month%20Chikungunya%20virus%20disease,population,%20April%202024-March%202025&amp;amp;text=1%20Apr%202025-,Since%20the%20beginning%20of%202025,%20and%20as%20of%20March,%20approximately,department%20and%20region%20of%20France)." target="_blank"&gt;says the&lt;/a&gt; EU-backed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA officials said as of Wednesday that 17 "serious adverse events" were reported globally in people over age 62 who got Ixchiq, with two reported deaths. Of the 17 reports, six were U.S.-based, but American health officials did not indicate if any of those deaths were in the United States.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, officials pointed out that reported adverse events "may not be causally related to vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and the symptoms &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;can last anywhere&lt;/a&gt; from one week to several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2024/06/25/cdc-health-advisory-dengue-fever/6631719366612/" target="_blank"&gt;dengue fever&lt;/a&gt;, chikungunya virus causes high fever, rashes, headache and joint pain. And while most patients recover with days, the joint pain can persist for months that can be managed with pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while it has the potential to temporarily disable a victim, it does not often result in death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single-dose shot approved November 2023 by the federal government was for use in adults with an increased risk of exposure to the chikungunya virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes can infect people with Zika and chikungunya viruses at the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2016/11/14/Mosquitoes-can-spread-Zika-Chikungunya-at-the-same-time/8681479181450/" target="_blank"&gt;research has suggested&lt;/a&gt;, and may &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/11/30/Mosquito-borne-chikungunya-may-cause-fatal-brain-infection/5381448917779/" target="_blank"&gt;cause fatal brain infection&lt;/a&gt; which hit 24 victims by November 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus was &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/06/19/Georgia-woman-infected-with-chikungunya-virus-describes-pain/5711403179228/?spt=hn&amp;amp;or=1" target="_blank"&gt;observed and described in&lt;/a&gt; U.S. patients who traveled from the Caribbean area to Georgia and North Carolina as chikungunya &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2014/06/19/Mosquito-borne-virus-spreads-to-Cuba/7011403207907/" target="_blank"&gt;hit Cuba around&lt;/a&gt; May 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya, an illness caused by a virus spread via mosquito bites but not by person-to-person contact, was &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/05/02/Chikungunya-spreading-to-other-countries-in-the-Caribbean/4561399051386/" target="_blank"&gt;first detected in the&lt;/a&gt; Americas near the end of 2013 as it swiftly spread to other Caribbean nations, Africa and Asia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, no cases have been reported on Europe's mainland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday's federal advisory on Ixchiq arrived amid a crackdown on vaccine use and its pertinent studies lead by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/01/29/robert-f-kennedy-confirmation-hearing/8251738077750/" target="_blank"&gt;known critic of&lt;/a&gt; effective and long-existing vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In real-life analysis of 1,000 children under 16 with severe obesity over a number of years, about a quarter of patients in 2023 were given the weight loss drug liraglutide in addition to receiving intensive health behaviour and lifestyle treatment at the National Childhood &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; Centre in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The clinicians found that nearly a third of these children dropped enough weight to improve their health, compared with about 27% in earlier treated groups with no access to the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Patients starting the programme in 2024 have been given semaglutide but results from these children are not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Semaglutide, better known as Wegovy, and liraglutide, sold as Saxenda, are both GLP-1 receptor agonists, which help curb appetite. In the UK they are available on the NHS only for adults with a BMI above 35 with a weight-related condition, although in certain circumstances specialist paediatric clinics can prescribe them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Annika Janson, of Karolinska university hospital in Sweden, the lead author of the study, whose findings were presented at the European Congress on Obesity, said the beneficial impact of weight loss jabs on children’s weight could accelerate in future years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Only a fraction of the children had GLP-1 drugs and most of those who did started on them six to 12 months into the treatment programme. Longer-term treatment may lead to greater improvements in BMI,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In addition to helping to curb hunger, families reported reduced conflicts around food and improved capacity for other lifestyle adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It was . Portions could be downsized. For some children, not being hungry all the time is a new feeling,” Janson said. “GLP-1 receptor agonists are clearly beneficial to many children with severe obesity and, while they won’t help in all cases, more children should have access to these important medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;NHS England has announced it is rolling out “smart scales” that monitor children’s weight remotely in an attempt to “nudge” behaviour towards healthier eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="27d30384-d0da-43c5-a81b-7ce6dcb3b565" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Being overweight as a young child could double risk of adult obesity, research shows","elementId":"27d30384-d0da-43c5-a81b-7ce6dcb3b565","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/11/being-overweight-as-a-young-child-could-double-risk-of-adult-obesity-research-shows"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About 350 families are already using the technology in 15 &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/get-involved/cyp/specialist-clinics-for-children-and-young-people-living-with-obesity/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;specialist paediatric weight management clinics&lt;/a&gt;. NHS England said on Monday it would deploy the scales to a further four clinics in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The digital weighing scales connect to an app and have “hidden digits” so families don’t see the specific weight.

&lt;p&gt;Natural remedies for household &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/pests/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with pests"&gt;pests&lt;/a&gt; have gained popularity as homeowners seek alternatives to chemical repellents. Among these solutions, one Mediterranean plant stands out for its exceptional ability to ward off &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/flies/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with flies"&gt;flies&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/summer/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with summer"&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; months. This humble yet powerful herb offers an organic approach to pest control that’s both effective and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rue plant: the natural fly repellent from Mediterranean shores&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The common rue (Ruta graveolens), native to the Mediterranean basin, has become a valuable ally for those battling housefly invasions. This hardy perennial thrives in sunny, rocky terrain and has been cultivated for centuries not only for its medicinal properties but also for its remarkable insect-repelling capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-in-text-1" id="farmi-734428905"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="3843226833" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes rue particularly effective against flies is its distinctive aroma. The plant contains powerful compounds including rutin and natural citronella that flies find deeply unpleasant. Strategically placing rue plants around entry points, windowsills, or outdoor dining areas creates a natural barrier that flies actively avoid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike chemical alternatives, rue offers a sustainable solution that requires minimal maintenance. The plant’s effectiveness complements other natural pest management approaches, such as &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/14/my-neighbor-told-me-about-this-plant-that-he-placed-near-his-rose-bushes-to-keep-pests-away/"&gt;companion planting techniques that protect garden plants from common pests&lt;/a&gt;. Many gardeners discover that integrating rue into their landscape provides dual benefits of fly control and enhanced &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/garden/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with garden"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense-3" id="farmi-443957131"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="9294255259" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense" id="farmi-3723469720"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="4875636047" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why flies become unbearable during summer months&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Summer’s warm temperatures create ideal breeding conditions for houseflies. A single female fly can lay over 500 eggs within days when conditions are favorable. These eggs are typically deposited in organic matter like food waste, improperly sealed garbage, or decaying vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The combination of heat, humidity, and abundant food sources creates perfect conditions for explosive population growth. Within weeks, what started as a few harmless flies can become an overwhelming infestation that disrupts indoor comfort and outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond their nuisance factor, flies pose potential health concerns as they transfer bacteria between surfaces. This makes effective management even more important, especially during peak summer months when families spend more time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While conventional repellents offer temporary relief, they often contain chemicals that raise environmental and health concerns. Natural alternatives like rue provide effective deterrence without these drawbacks, making them ideal for households with children, pets, or &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/10/04/why-you-absolutely-must-grow-this-little-known-but-essential-aromatic-plant-in-your-garden/"&gt;garden enthusiasts who value essential aromatic plants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Growing and using rue for maximum effectiveness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rue thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it perfectly adapted to Mediterranean-like conditions. The plant requires minimal watering once established, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance similar to &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/23/plant-this-succulent-now-and-enjoy-a-sumptuous-flowerbed-until-the-first-frost/"&gt;certain succulents that provide beautiful blooms with minimal care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For fly deterrence, position potted rue plants near windows, doorways, and outdoor seating areas. The plant’s natural oils will create an invisible barrier that flies instinctively avoid. For enhanced effectiveness, gently brush the foliage occasionally to release more of its aromatic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rue’s pest management benefits extend beyond flies. The plant also repels moths, mites, and aphids, making it a versatile addition to any garden. When incorporated into a comprehensive garden plan, rue can contribute to a &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/10/this-dense-plant-cover-turns-out-to-be-the-ideal-solution-against-the-proliferation-of-weeds/"&gt;healthier garden ecosystem that naturally suppresses weed growth&lt;/a&gt; and promotes beneficial insect populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ancient remedy with multiple benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rue’s usefulness isn’t limited to pest control. For centuries, traditional medicine has valued this plant for its diverse therapeutic applications. In various cultures, rue has been used to aid digestion, support liver function, and relieve menstrual discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chilean health authorities recognize rue for its anti-parasitic properties and potential benefits for rheumatism relief. Some traditional practitioners even recommend it for skin conditions like eczema. While modern research continues to investigate these claims, rue’s historical significance in herbal medicine remains undisputed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond its medicinal applications, rue serves as an excellent companion to other plants that require protection from summer pests. Its natural deterrent properties make it an ideal addition to gardens struggling with insect pressure, similar to how &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/03/03/say-goodbye-to-mosquitoes-this-summer-plant-this-herb-in-your-garden-now/"&gt;certain herbs can effectively repel mosquitoes throughout summer months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With its combination of pest-repelling properties and minimal maintenance requirements, the Mediterranean rue offers an elegant solution to summer’s persistent fly problem. This forgotten plant deserves renewed attention from today’s gardeners seeking natural alternatives to chemical pest control.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study reveals that these anesthetics trigger a common signature: increased phase locking at low frequencies, particularly between brain hemispheres, while disrupting local cortical communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that phase alignment—not just brain wave power—may be a universal marker of unconsciousness.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the two drugs have in common, the researchers discovered, is the way they push around brain waves, which are produced by the collective electrical activity of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain waves are in phase, meaning the peaks and valleys of the waves are aligned, local groups of neurons in the brain’s cortex can share information to produce conscious cognitive functions such as attention, perception and reasoning, said Picower Professor Earl K. Miller, senior author of the new study in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain waves fall out of phase, local communications, and therefore functions, fall apart, producing unconsciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding, led by graduate student Alexandra Bardon, not only adds to scientists’ understanding of the dividing line between consciousness and unconsciousness, Miller said, but also could provide a common new measure for anesthesiologists who use a variety of different anesthetics to maintain patients on the proper side of that line during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at the way phase is shifted in our recordings, you can barely tell which drug it was,” said Miller, a faculty member in The Picower Institute and MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s valuable for medical practice.  Plus if unconsciousness has a universal signature, it could also reveal the mechanisms that generate consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If more anesthetic drugs are also shown to affect phase in the same way, then anesthesiologists might be able to use brain wave phase alignment as a reliable marker of unconsciousness as they titrate doses of anesthetic drugs, Miller said, regardless of which particular mix of drugs they are using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That insight could aid efforts to build closed-loop systems that can aid anesthesiologists by constantly adjusting drug dose based on brain wave measurements of the patient’s unconsciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller has been collaborating with study co-author Emery N. Brown, an anesthesiologist and Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Computational Neuroscience and Medical Engineering in The Picower Institute, on building such a system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent clinical trial with colleagues in Japan, Brown demonstrated that monitoring brain wave power signals using EEG enabled an anesthesiologist to use much less sevoflurane during surgery with young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reduced doses proved safe and were associated with many improved clinical outcomes including a reduced incidence of post-operative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists studying anesthesia have rarely paid attention to phase, but in the new study, Bardon, Brown and Miller’s team made a point of it as they anesthetized two animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the animals lost consciousness, the measurements indicated a substantial increase in “phase locking,” especially at low frequencies. Phase locking means that the relative differences in phase remained more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what caught the researchers’ attention were the differences that became locked in: Within each hemisphere, regardless of which anesthetic they used, brain wave phase became misaligned between the dorsolateral and ventrolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, brain wave phase across hemispheres became more aligned, not less. But Miller notes that case is still a big shift from the conscious state, in which brain hemispheres are typically not aligned well, so the finding is a further indication that major changes of phase alignment, albeit in different ways at different distances, are a correlate of unconsciousness compared to wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increase in interhemispheric alignment of activity by anesthetics seems to reverse the pattern observed in the awake, cognitively engaged brain,” the Bardon and Miller team wrote in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determined by distance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance proved to be a major factor in determining the change in phase alignment. Even across the 2.5 millimeters of a single electrode array, low-frequency waves moved 20-30 degrees out of alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the 20 or so millimeters between arrays in the upper (dorsolateral) and lower (ventrolateral) regions within a hemisphere, that would mean a roughly 180-degree shift in phase alignment which is a complete offset of the waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dependence on distance is consistent with the idea of waves traveling across the cortex, Miller said. Indeed in a 2022 study, Miller and Brown’s labs showed that the anesthetic propofol induced a powerful low-frequency traveling wave that swept straight across the cortex, overwhelming higher-frequency straight and rotating waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new results raise many opportunities for follow-up studies, Miller said. Does propofol (another anesthetic) also produce this signature of changed phase alignment? What role do traveling waves play in the phenomenon? And given that sleep is also characterized by increased power in slow wave frequencies, but is definitely not the same state as anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, could phase alignment explain the difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Bardon, Brown and Miller, the paper’s other authors are Jesus Ballesteros, Scott Brincat, Jefferson Roy, Meredith Mahnke, and Yumiko Ishizawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. Department of Energy, The National Institutes of Health, The Simons Center for the Social Brain, The Freedom Together Foundation and The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory provided support for the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and consciousness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#533732253a37393c133e3a277d363726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;David Orenstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;David Orenstein – Picower Institute at MIT&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Convergent effects of different anesthetics on changes in phase alignment of cortical oscillations&lt;/a&gt;” by Alexandra Bardon et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convergent effects of different anesthetics on changes in phase alignment of cortical oscillations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many anesthetics cause loss of consciousness despite having diverse underlying molecular and circuit actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the convergent effects of these drugs, we examine how anesthetic doses of ketamine and dexmedetomidine affect bilateral oscillations in the prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both anesthetics increase phase locking in the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, within and across hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the nature of the phase locking varies. Neighboring prefrontal subregions within a hemisphere show decreased phase alignment with both drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local analyses within a region suggest that this finding could be explained by broad cortical distance-based effects, such as large traveling waves. In contrast, homologous areas across hemispheres become more aligned in phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that both anesthetics induce strong patterns of cortical phase alignment that are markedly different from those during waking and that these patterns may be a common feature driving loss of responsiveness from different anesthetic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 21:51:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBIeS1uOGROYnZRVFdKYW9UZjc5UVZULVpvUmI1SDNzaHFwMm91S0pCamV5T2dEcnZjRGFPc1ZWSFNTUzR2MUZOMDhsWERVQVpNdUxIeHhjeFgwUV90R3U3XzRadm9OWmdsWTBRbA</guid></item><item><title>“我们在莱姆中心” ：马里兰州兽医警告宠物主人蜱虫的威胁- WTOP | ‘We’re in Lyme central’: Maryland veterinarian warns pet owners about the threat of ticks - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxON0tXTkwtMmlFV0MtaXE2NXE3aHNCemZ6NDJWTFgxanVSbnNKeENndDlOdl91VzMtdjJCXzNMalpsU1RvUXNTeDh0YUZZR3BNVVl4NngzR05rNk5UNHE2cWNFZlVFNlVRTVlvc0p2V25uWE5aRlh2ZXo2NnNyYmZ5ZjNBb2lyUldfZGVtdg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;As the weather turns warmer a lot of us are spending more time outside, which means dog owners are on the lookout for ticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weather turns warmer, a lot of us are spending more time outside, which means dog owners are on the lookout for ticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While people think of the spring and summer as tick season, a Maryland-based veterinarian said he sees more ticks in the fall months of October, November and December than he does in July and August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ticks come out all year round,” said Dr. Victor Katz, of &lt;a href="https://www.mbvets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Muddy Branch Veterinary Center&lt;/a&gt; in Gaithersburg. “If it gets to 32 degrees frost, they might be a little dormant, but as soon as it warms up to 35-37 degrees, they start moving around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dog’s ambient temperature is 101 degrees. Ticks want to be warm and can sense temperature, humidity and movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They basically hatch out and basically attach to the dogs. They just want to be warm,” Katz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several tick-related diseases prevalent in the D.C. region, including Lyme, ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They moved the epicenter for studying Lyme disease from Hartford, Connecticut, to Derwood, Maryland, about seven years ago,” Katz said. “We are in ‘Lyme central.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katz pointed to monthly oral preventive medication, such as Simparica, Bravecto and NexGard, as the best way to keep your dogs safe from tick borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It does not put a bubble around the dog where it basically shoots the tick with laser beams or something like that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if a tick bites a dog that’s on an oral preventive, it will die in about four to six hours. Transmission of some of these diseases often takes up to 10 to 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, it’s basically wiping the tick out before they get a chance to transmit enough of the disease to harm the dog,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is data, according to Katz, that shows the preventatives might increase seizure potential in some dogs. He recommended for those dogs, using a Seresto tick collar that lasts about six months and, he said, “works really well.”&lt;/p&gt;

Hall at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, Erica Greenberg, MD and Kevin Gipson, MD, MS, at Massachusetts General Hospital, and colleagues also report evidence that dopamine and GABA—primary neurotransmitters in CSTC circuitry—are dysregulated in patients with these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of how CSTC dysregulation relates to sleep disorders could lead to more effective treatments, the reviewers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review also confirms subjective reports of poor sleep and insomnia with CSTC-conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviewers used PubMed, Google Scholar, PsychInfo, and Web of Science to search for relevant English-language articles published before August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They defined OCSDs as including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), body-focused repetitive behavior (BFRB) disorders, and hoarding disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic tic disorders include Tourette syndrome and chronic/persistent motor or vocal tic disorder. The team identified 42 papers: 23 on OCSDs, eight on CTDs, 10 on ADHD, and one on both CTDs and ADHD. They refer to these disorders collectively as CSTC-conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-occurring objective sleep movement disorders were consistently reported in adults with CTDs or OCD, and similar subjective findings were documented for children with OCD, ADHD, or CTDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although only a small number of studies included polysomnographic data, there was evidence of a sleep disturbance pattern with OCD, BFRB disorders, and CTDs. Subjective sleep latency problems and objective sleep spindle disruption were both common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The evidence reviewed in this paper supports a bidirectional, additive increase in sleep and CSTC-condition symptoms,” the reviewers write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to evidence that disordered sleep may be intrinsic to these CSTC-conditions, poor sleep can also impair functional connectivity and may result in structural changes in the fronto-striatal circuitry, likely further exacerbating CSTC-condition symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining treatments for sleep-related complaints in patients with CSTC-conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three potential approaches to treating sleep disturbances in patients with CSTC-conditions, the team notes: (1) treatment of the condition, which may indirectly treat sleep-related concerns; (2) treatment of sleep, which may indirectly treat symptoms of the CSTC-condition; and (3) treatment of both approaches simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective approach, however, may differ from person to person, contingent on the specific condition(s) and sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviewers say careful treatment selection is particularly important for children taking medication for CSTC-conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians must weigh “the potential long-term effects of an altered sleep architecture against the substantial risks of untreated psychopathology, which comes with its own significant sequelae,” they emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying medications that mitigate core symptoms while stabilizing or improving sleep architecture, as opposed to exacerbating existing sleep disturbances, is a critical avenue for future research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, the reviewers cite selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

&lt;p&gt;A gene variant that helps protect people from HIV infection likely originated in people who lived during the span of time between the Stone Age and the Viking Age, a new study of thousands of genomes reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It turns out that the variant arose in one individual who lived in an area near the Black Sea between 6,700 and 9,000 years ago," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/simon-rasmussen" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/simon-rasmussen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Simon Rasmussen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioinformatics expert at the University of Copenhagen and co-senior author of the study, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/researchers-map-7000-year-old-genetic-mutation-that-protects-against-hiv/" target="_blank" data-url="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/researchers-map-7000-year-old-genetic-mutation-that-protects-against-hiv/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

However, attempts to identify its origin and trace its spread have previously come up short, since ancient genomes are often extremely fragmentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the research team identified the mutation in 2,504 genomes from modern humans sampled for the 1000 Genomes Project, an international effort to catalog human genetic variation. Then, they created a model to search 934 ancient genomes from various regions of Eurasia ranging from the early Mesolithic period to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/viking-history-facts-myths" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/viking-history-facts-myths"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Viking Age&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from roughly 8000 B.C. to A.D. 1000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-6DtrKGFueCiAvELXT6UAo8" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-6DtrKGFueCiAvELXT6UAo8 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By looking at this large dataset, we can determine where and when the mutation arose," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/kirstine-johanne-theresia-ravn" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/kirstine-johanne-theresia-ravn" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kirstine Ravn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's genetic detective work revealed that the person who first carried this mutation lived near the Black Sea around 7000 B.C., around the time &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/who-were-the-first-farmers" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/who-were-the-first-farmers"&gt;&lt;u&gt;early farmers arrived in Europe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via Western Asia. The researchers also discovered that the prevalence of the mutation exploded between 8,000 and 2,000 years ago, suggesting it was extremely useful as people moved out of the Eurasian steppe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's findings contradict previous assumptions that the mutation emerged more recently. For instance, this means that the increase in the frequency of the mutation did not result from medieval plagues or from Viking exploration, which may have introduced pressure for humans' immune cells to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it's not being ransacked by HIV, the CCR5 protein helps control how immune cells &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819895947" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819895947" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;respond to signals called chemokines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, likely helping direct cells to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5133339/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5133339/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sites of inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that people who carried the special CCR5 variant had an advantage. "People with this mutation were better at surviving, likely because it dampened the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system"&gt;&lt;u&gt;immune system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during a time when humans were exposed to new pathogens," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/leonardo-cobuccio" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/leonardo-cobuccio" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Leonardo Cobuccio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen, said in the statement.

Of course, this is a hypothesis; the exact pressures that lead to the variant's increase aren't known for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="stone-age-quiz-what-do-you-know-about-the-paleolithic-mesolithic-and-neolithic-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/stone-age-quiz-what-do-you-know-about-the-paleolithic-mesolithic-and-neolithic" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/stone-age-quiz-what-do-you-know-about-the-paleolithic-mesolithic-and-neolithic"&gt;Stone Age quiz&lt;/a&gt;: What do you know about the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic?&lt;/h2&gt;

A new review reveals how each hemisphere processes the opposite side of your field of vision, not only early on but even in higher-level cognition like attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This separation gives us a “bilateral advantage,” increasing our capacity to track multiple objects across the visual field. The brain seamlessly coordinates the handoff of information between hemispheres, avoiding confusion as objects move across our gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bilateral Advantage:&lt;/strong&gt; Dividing visual input across both hemispheres improves object-tracking capacity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatial-Only Split:&lt;/strong&gt; The hemispheric divide applies to spatial info, not features like color or shape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless Coordination:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain hemispheres “handoff” visual targets like cell towers switching a call.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People have a lot of misconceptions about what the brain’s left and right hemispheres do, but one well-known aspect of this division may be even more true than people realize: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain not only splits up visual spatial perception—processing what’s on our left in the right hemisphere and what’s on our right in the left hemisphere—it takes cognitive advantage of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title="The Brain’s Hemispheres and the Architecture of Perception" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tvTmM9h15yg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new review by MIT neuroscientists explains what the field has learned about this division of labor, the trade-off it involves and how the brain ultimately bridges the divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People hear all these myths about the left brain being more analytical and the right brain being more artistic, or people being right-brained vs left-brained. Ninety-nine percent of that is nonsense,” said paper co-author Earl K. Miller, Picower Professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You think with your whole brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to visual spatial perception, the brain has evolved separate neural resources for the right vs left sides of gaze even in later stages of cognitive processing, Miller said. Why? To optimize its capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s for good reason,” said Miller, who co-authored the new review in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychologia &lt;/em&gt;with Picower Institute research scientist Scott Brincat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perceptual capacity is limited—you can only take in so much at once. If you’re your capacity is fully tied up on the right side of your gaze, you might miss a threat approaching on the left. Splitting resources between both sides helps avoid dangerous perceptual blind spots”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separated sight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Miller was in graduate school, he said, he was taught that the brain neatly divided its visual perception of space between hemispheres until the information reached the prefrontal cortex where it became seamlessly blended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experiments by Miller and Brincat, as well as many other researchers, have been accumulating evidence to refine that view over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies have shown that even in the prefrontal cortex, neural encoding of information about where an object is, is still biased toward the “contralateral” hemisphere, or the hemisphere opposite of where the object appears in the field of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, the two hemispheres appear to function surprisingly independently, even for high-level cognitive functions like attention and working memory,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence is apparent in measurements of the brain waves produced by coordinated networks of neurons in each hemisphere. Gamma frequency wave power increases in frontal brain hemispheres when they consider the visual stimuli that appear on the contralateral side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, studies for decades (including one in 1971) have shown that people and animals can remember more things if their presentation is split between hemispheres rather than presented all on one side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists call this the “bilateral advantage,” though it is not perfect. People don’t track multiple things, even if split across both sides, as well as they track just one thing on either side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also exhibit individualized differences in perceptual capacity across the visual field. Miller has founded the startup company SplitSage to measure these differences with the goal of helping people with visually oriented complex tasks to improve their performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the studies that Brincat and Miller review in the new paper show that the split bias between hemispheres applies only to spatial information—the &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; something is. Other features like color or shape are processed by both hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless sight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the brain maintains a separation in its processing of spatial visual perception, even at the stage of allocating attention and juggling objects in working memory, why aren’t we confused or surprised when a bird flying from our left passes into the right side of our field of view? We also easily handle cases where our shifting gaze moves an object from one eye’s field of view to the other’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We experience a seamless world,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the brain accomplishes the “handoff” from one hemisphere to the other much like two cellular towers do for your phone as you drive around, according to neural activity measurements in studies such as one in 2014 and one that Brincat and Miller led in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a tracked target approaches the visual midline, the hemisphere about to receive the target shows a ramp-up of activity well before the crossing time, as if it is anticipating the target,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further, activity in the sending hemisphere remains high well after the crossing. Thus, for up to a second or more, neural signals reflecting the target are shared across both hemispheres. It is as if both hemispheres are holding the baton.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the “bilateral advantage,” there is a small performance cost when this transfer happens, studies show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deficits in interhemispheric connectivity or synchrony are apparent in neurological and psychiatric diseases including Alzheimer’s, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorders, the authors note. Brincat and Miller’s review emphasizes that such disruptions could affect cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A foundational understanding of interhemispheric processing, combined with interventions translatable to human patients offers hope for developing novel network-level treatments,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#640005120d000e0b24090d104a010011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;David Orenstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;David Orenstein – Picower Institute at MIT&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2025.109153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cognitive independence and interactions between cerebral hemispheres&lt;/a&gt;” by Scott Brincat et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuropsychologia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive independence and interactions between cerebral hemispheres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two cerebral hemispheres can often operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But interactions between them are critical for cognition and have been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurophysiological studies have long focused on a single hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we review recent studies showing neurophysiological evidence showing both independence and interactions between the hemispheres during complex behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

However, there are some things that, though seemingly small, may require a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; spoke to Dr Lori Solomon, chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at New York Medical College, and Dr Estelle Williams, ​​medical director for CityMD for the southern New Jersey region to get their thoughts on which symptoms should really not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going to the bathroom too frequently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waking up in the middle of the night needing to pee is totally normal, Solomon tells &lt;em&gt;The Independent.&lt;/em&gt; But if that’s something you’re doing two or three times per night – every night – that might be indicative of a more serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over-frequent urination can be a &lt;a href="/topic/symptom"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. “When your sugar is high, one of the ways the body tries to get rid of the sugar, is to get rid of it through the urine,” Soloman says. “During the day, you just go to the bathroom more often, but at nighttime, you often have to wake up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 eGgKya"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/22/iStock-1768701808.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/22/iStock-1768701808.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/22/iStock-1768701808.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Simple things such as needing to go to the bathroom frequently at night, or pain that causes you to wake up, may be a sign of something more serious that should be checked out by a medical professional" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-36957"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Simple things such as needing to go to the bathroom frequently at night, or pain that causes you to wake up, may be a sign of something more serious that should be checked out by a medical professional&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams agrees, adding that other worrying signs can be feeling more thirsty and a significant increase in appetite. “Those are the types of things I think need to be checked sooner rather than later,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain in the night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any pain that wakes you up during the night could be a problem. While pulled muscles, physical injuries, or other discomforts may hinder someone getting to sleep – they shouldn’t be disturbing you once you’re asleep, Solomon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're waking up in the middle of the night with a headache, you've got a problem… because usually we don't wake up with headaches in the middle of the night,” she says. “If that's waking you up at night – I'm a little bit more worried about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden headaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headaches are “super common,” and shouldn’t necessarily be considered worrisome, Solomon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if a headache is accompanied by other things such as vision changes, nausea tingling in the extremities, weakness – those may be a sign that something neurological is going on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams cautions those who jump to label sudden, severe headaches as &lt;a href="/topic/migraines"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;. “A migraine is actually a very specific &lt;a href="/topic/diagnosis"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and headache pattern, requiring neurologic evaluation,” she says. “It's good that you get evaluated if you're having a headache that's unusual for you, if it’s very intense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 jIjruH"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/41/iStock-2132184395.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/41/iStock-2132184395.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/41/iStock-2132184395.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Headaches are super common, but if you’re experiencing extra symptoms including nausea, vision changes or weakness this can be a sign of something else.

I was just doing my regular activities and I became very winded and short of breath,’ get that checked,” she says. “I would also say, if you take a deep breath and you develop pain in your chest or your back that you've never had before, that can sometimes be a soft sign for a &lt;a href="/topic/blood-clot"&gt;blood clot&lt;/a&gt; in the lungs, called a pulmonary embolism, that we certainly want to see for sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/fatigue"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; too – while common in many people due to hectic work schedules or other lifestyle commitments – should not be significantly interfering with things you would do day-to-day such as exercising, Solomon adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In very severe cases, fatigue can be symptomatic of &lt;a href="/topic/heart-disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, sleep apnea, and even some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indigestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one less obvious and very typical symptom of heart disease. “It's very common for people who are having a &lt;a href="/topic/heart-attack"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; to think they're having indigestion,” Solomon says. “If you’re taking a walk and all of a sudden you feel like, ‘Oh, I’ve got some indigestion’, and then it gets better when you stop walking, that's your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of fatigue and indigestion, unconnected to a big meal, is something that people should see the doctor about, she says. It could be due to a lack of blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams says that bouts of indigestion-like symptoms – pressure or tightness – that last for 15 minutes or 20 minutes can be telling, especially for those who do not typically suffer from indigestion or heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people think ‘Oh, I just ate something weird, and I must have a bubble of gas in my chest,” she says. “That sensation of indigestion is something that can be an indicator of heart disease… It can be a masker of something more serious.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood in your stool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor your bowels, says Williams, because being constipated or having diarrhea is something that's different is worth getting checked out. And while it may seem obvious, seeing blood in either your poop or pee is definitely something to see a doctor about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re having a change of bowel habits – if you see black stool or a lot of blood when you’re using the restroom, I feel like that's perhaps not a subtle sign,” William says. “That's something a little more concerning that means you should come in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often associate blood in the stool as a hemorrhoid, but should not be ignored as it can be a common presentation for &lt;a href="/topic/colon-cancer"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, according to Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general you generally don't want to see blood in the urine either,” she says. “But that's usually &lt;a href="/topic/kidney-stones"&gt;kidney stones&lt;/a&gt; or urinary tract infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon also warns people to pay attention when things just don’t clear up on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there's a cough lasting more than four weeks, you generally want to see somebody about that,” Solomon says. “There's lots of reasons you can have a cough, but generally, if you have a cough after a cold, it generally goes away in a few weeks. So if it lasts longer than a month, we generally want to know about that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams agrees, adding that things that have been happening for months that may seem innocuous may still be worth investigating. Losing weight unintentionally is definitely something worth mentioning to your primary care doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 ccMPxj"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/56/iStock-1715472524.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/56/iStock-1715472524.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/56/iStock-1715472524.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="There are many reasons that a person can get a cough, though most generally go away in a week or so following a cold.

&lt;p&gt;Dry eye disease, which occurs when tears are unable to adequately lubricate the eyes, is a common symptom of not only Sjögren’s but a number of other conditions, the researchers noted. Here, the use of eye drops with MSCs was tested in a study in China involving patients with and without Sjögren’s whose symptoms did not respond to other treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are promising, per the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have demonstrated that MSC eye drops might offer clinical efficacy and manageable safety in treating refractory [dry eye disease] for the first time, potentially bringing a new perspective on the treatment of such patients,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial findings were detailed in “&lt;a href="https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-025-04292-8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A first-in-human, prospective pilot trial of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell eye drops therapy for patients with refractory non-Sjögren’s and Sjögren’s syndrome dry eye disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” a study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Stem Cell Research &amp;amp; Therapy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of dry eye disease can include eye irritation and dryness, blurred vision, and the sensation of a foreign body in the eyes. Sjögren’s, a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the glands that produce tears and saliva, is a common cause of dry eye disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatments such as artificial tears, topical corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapies are available. However, the researchers noted, their efficacy “varies significantly among individuals,” and can “[cause] sight-threatening side effects,” with the outcomes for patients “often falling short of satisfactory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a team from the Affiliated Hospital of Medical School at Nanjing University sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MSC eye drops in adults with dry eye disease who did not respond to current treatments; these patients were considered to have refractory dry eye disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A type of stem cells, MSCs can grow and give rise to other cell types in the body, such as those making up muscles, bones, cartilage, and fat. These cells can be isolated from several tissues, as well, including fat, bone marrow, and the umbilical cord. MSCs also can influence the activity of other cells, most notably immune cells, by releasing certain signaling molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team conducted an open-label clinical trial (&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05784519"&gt;NCT05784519&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojEN.html?proj=165917"&gt;ChiCTR2200058115&lt;/a&gt;) testing the stem cell eye drops in these patients, with follow-up at four weeks, or at about one month, and at one year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This clinical trial represents a groundbreaking exploration into the preliminary therapeutic potential and safety of umbilical cord MSC eye drops for patients with refractory [dry eye disease],” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five study participants had been &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/diagnosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;diagnosed with Sjögren’s&lt;/a&gt;, and 11 had dry eye disease but didn’t have Sjögren’s. All received eye drops with MSCs isolated from the umbilical cord, given twice daily for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;This clinical trial represents a groundbreaking exploration into the preliminary therapeutic potential and safety of umbilical cord MSC eye drops for patients with refractory [or hard-to-treat dry eye disease].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers used OSDI, or ocular surface disease index, scores as a patient-reported measure of eye discomfort. Tcorneal fluorescein staining (CFS) scores were used for evaluating eye surface damage. Additional assessments for tear quality and quantity included the Schirmer I test (SIT), tear meniscus height (TMH), and noninvasive break-up time (NIBUT), which measures the stability of the tear film on the eye’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the MSC eye drops significantly eased most signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in patients with and without Sjögren’s at four weeks, per the researchers. Benefits were particularly seen in terms of tear production, as measured by SIT and TMH, and reduced eye surface damage, as measured by CFS. Average NIBUT scores and self-reported OSDI scores also improved, but reached statistical significance only in patients without Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant improvements across all measures were also seen one year after treatment in the group of patients who did not have Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Analyses suggest drops work by reducing inflammation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also assessed the function of the meibomian glands, which produce a fat-like substance that overlays the eye surface to prevent tear film evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At four weeks, the MSC eye drops had significantly enhanced the protective fatty layer and reduced meibomian gland obstruction in both patient groups, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an analysis of tears before and after treatment, the stem cell eye drops significantly reduced the levels of two pro-inflammatory immune signaling proteins, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-17A, in all patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with patients without Sjögren’s, those with the disease had significantly lower levels of MUC5AC before treatment. MUC5AC is a protein found in human tear film that helps maintain eye surface lubrication. After treatment, the levels of MUC5AC rose significantly in Sjögren’s patients, per the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analyses suggested that MSC eye drops worked by reducing inflammation caused by a type of immune cell called Th17 cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some patients experienced treatment-related adverse reactions, most were mild in severity and had a minimal impact on daily life. The most frequently reported adverse events were eye surface discomfort, such as foreign body sensation and stinging eye pain, all of which resolved within two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study validated that the treatment of refractory [non-Sjögren’s dry eye] and [Sjögren’s dry eye] patients with MSC eye drops is a feasible and safe application method, particularly showing good and enduring efficacy for tear deficiency and meibomian gland blockage,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team noted the small trial size as a key limitation of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To further validate the therapeutic efficacy and explore the underlying mechanisms of treatment, it is necessary to conduct randomized controlled clinical trials with a larger sample size and an extended follow-up period,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIG HARBOR, Wash. — The Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department is investigating a suspected norovirus outbreak that sickened dozens of students and staff at a Gig Harbor elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple students at Discovery Elementary School in Gig Harbor showed signs of gastroenteritis on Thursday, according to the Peninsula School District. Staff sent the ill students home and notified the health department when the number of absences reached the reporting threshold.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50 students were absent or sent home on Friday, the district said. Staff were also affected by the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Norovirus&lt;/a&gt; is a contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It’s spread through direct contact with an infected person, eating or drinking contaminated food or touching contaminated surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department is still investigating the cause of the outbreak, although it determined the school kitchen was not the source, according to the school district.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a precaution, the school kitchen was temporarily closed to be sanitized. Meals will be prepared at another school, and bag lunches will be served at Discovery Elementary on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitchen staff must remain symptom-free for 48 hours before the kitchen can reopen, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school district said it implemented enhanced cleaning protocols throughout the building and scheduled restrooms to be periodically closed during the school day for extra cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department recommended that students and staff should stay home until they have been symptom-free for 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected with norovirus will develop symptoms within 12 to 48 hours of being exposed, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norovirus can be prevented by washing your hands often, cooking shellfish thoroughly, washing fruits and vegetables, disinfecting surfaces and staying home if symptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

The research was led by a team of scientists from &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt;, who constructed FaceAge, an AI tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts trained the tool on almost 60,000 images of healthy individuals and then tested it on more than 6,000 patients who were starting radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the typical cancer patient appeared about five years older than their birth certificate suggested, and that each additional year shortened their life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-selfie-to-biomarker"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From selfie to biomarker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge is a deep-learning network. It studies fine details – skin texture, muscle tone, and eye shape – then translates those patterns into a single number: your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-biological-age-may-predict-dementia-risk-better-than-birth-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process is automatic. If FaceAge receives a head-and-shoulders photo, it can predict an age that reflects the body’s wear and tear better than the chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How old a person seems has long guided doctors informally. Frail features can steer therapy toward gentler options; youthful vigor can justify aggressive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet such judgments are subjective. FaceAge puts a more objective figure on that impression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-face-age-and-cancer-prediction"&gt;AI, face age, and cancer prediction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, patients whose biological age topped 85 fared worst, even after the authors adjusted for sex, tumor site, and chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can use artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate a person’s biological age from face pictures, and our study shows that information can be clinically meaningful,” said Hugo Aerts, the director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) program at Mass General Brigham. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work demonstrates that a photo, like a simple selfie, contains important information that could help to inform clinical decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How old someone looks compared to their chronological age really matters – individuals with FaceAges that are younger than their chronological ages do significantly better after cancer therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faceage-captures-hidden-signals"&gt;FaceAge captures hidden signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predicting how long a terminal patient has left is difficult. The researchers asked ten clinicians and scientists to view one hundred portraits of people who were receiving palliative radiotherapy, and to guess whether each person would be alive within months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when the panel knew chronological age and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-thrives-on-human-stress-as-it-spreads-throughout-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; type, their accuracy barely beat chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding FaceAge shifted the odds. With the AI number in hand, the group’s predictions improved markedly, suggesting FaceAge captures hidden signals that physicians miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teaching-ai-to-see-face-age"&gt;Teaching AI to see face age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators began with public image banks that held 58,851 faces, each tagged with an age. Those photos came from everyday contexts, so the network first learned to recognize normal aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next the team applied FaceAge to clinical snapshots taken during routine treatment setup. Linking those pictures to medical records let the algorithm discover how appearance, disease, and outcome connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge still needs validation in larger and more diverse populations. The study cohort came from only two centers, and lighting or camera angles could skew results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosmetic surgery, heavy makeup, or cultural differences in skin care might also confuse the model. The team plans to follow patients over time to see whether the FaceAge number changes as therapy progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-early-detection-system"&gt;An early detection system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens the door to a whole new realm of biomarker discovery from photographs, and its potential goes far beyond cancer care or predicting age,” said co-senior author Ray Mak, a faculty member in the AIM program at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we increasingly think of different chronic diseases as diseases of aging, it becomes even more important to be able to accurately predict an individual’s aging trajectory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope we can ultimately use this technology as an early detection system in a variety of applications, within a strong regulatory and ethical framework, to help save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge illustrates how artificial intelligence can turn everyday data into medical guidance. A single selfie may soon complement blood tests and scans, giving oncologists a faster, less biased picture of a patient’s resilience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If further trials confirm the findings, clinics could upload photos and receive instantaneous biological age estimates that fine-tune treatment plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faceage-beyond-cancer-care"&gt;FaceAge: Beyond cancer care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging underlies &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-remains-the-leading-cause-of-death-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, dementia, and more. An image-based biomarker could therefore aid many specialties by identifying people who need lifestyle changes or preventive therapy years before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key will be strict oversight. Algorithms trained on limited datasets risk embedding bias, and patient consent will be vital when personal images feed predictive models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, FaceAge remains a research AI tool. Yet its promise is clear: the face you present to the camera may hold clues to how your body is coping with illness and time. Harnessed responsibly, that knowledge could guide decisions that extend life and improve its quality – one snapshot at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589750025000421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 17:52:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOVVk2VDdza1QtZEd0SHpOck94ZDVTSDdRZFZvS2luVEZLY2tmVzMxYlZqWE5TMVlhUjlHOWh4eldhSGl6Wkw5WUl2SGpSOWV2LUJwR3dpbEpLSUxFMEJVX0d3NHNkeDVNcDFlZDd0bDVvWVdHaThweGFrTlJYM3FWR1d3</guid></item><item><title>人工智能如何改善帕金森的护理-《今日帕金森新闻》 | How artificial intelligence could improve Parkinson’s care - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxQN2VJT3ZoX1FVMXRDc3g4al9ET3UwdWtiT3BxckNGS1Z6RWJnVUQtb0IwZkxpUmNtYlBId3Y4U1NKVEJaMmFwZEZmMUI5WnE0TGhqTlZ4M0ZVam5NVGlZV2ZEM1dzV1Y1dmgzZ1hKaWtrYjJycGFBOVBOMjFhVHp5MFpoNW5uSWtCTkpmV1JyYk5kTm9rbGloMjdNZEVZLXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence, or AI, is everywhere today. You hear about it on the news, at work, from your friends and family. There are stories of it being used to create everything from a sixth grader’s essay to a doctoral thesis. I’m using a tool with AI right now to write this column. It corrects my spelling and grammar, suggests the next word I might want to use, and rewrites sentences for clarity. AI can feel scary, but one of its most exciting uses is in the medical field, and what it can do for &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; is good at taking large amounts of information and finding patterns in it. It’s also good at filling in gaps — sometimes with accurate information and sometimes with things &lt;a href="https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/basics/addressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias/"&gt;it makes up&lt;/a&gt;! That’s why AI must always be used in concert with human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, its ability to recognize similarities and patterns in movement has great potential to help &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/"&gt;treat Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. One example of that is a new software called &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/ai-video-analysis-tool-helps-clinicians-assess-parkinsons-symptoms/"&gt;VisionMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This software, which is open-source and available for free, uses AI to analyze video taken right from the built-in camera on a computer or a phone to detect changes in &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. That’s important because assessing progression in Parkinson’s disease can be inconsistent. Many neurologists use the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale to compare different stages of the disease. This scale can be subjective based on who’s doing the exam, and humans can miss subtle changes that AI can detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the software is still new, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-025-00876-6"&gt;paper published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;npj Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt; found that the software’s ratings were even more consistent than those from experienced neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/ai-technology-parkinsons-trial-help-monitor-gait-freezing/"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; being conducted at Emory University’s Movement Disorders Center in Georgia is using AI’s data-processing capabilities to understand what causes &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/columns/mind-vs-brain-gait-freezing-perplexing-parkinsons-symptom/"&gt;gait freezing&lt;/a&gt; and to test treatments and ways of managing this common &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;Parkinson’s symptom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology is being used in a clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of gamma sensory flicker, a noninvasive therapy originally developed to treat &lt;a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/what-is-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;. It’s based on the theory that flickering sound and light can potentially disrupt brain signals and ease symptoms. The study leads touted the “precision and consistency” of AI-powered symptom tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another application is one I’ve personally experienced. I went to see one of my doctors the other day, and they had new AI transcription software. The program recorded the appointment, developed an accurate transcription, summarized the discussion, and suggested links to preapproved content on our treatment plan, which my provider texted me before I could get to my car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study found that doctors spend as much as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7661623/#:~:text=Using%20EHR%20access%20logs%20from,telephone%20encounters%20and%20other%20activities."&gt;one-third of their time&lt;/a&gt; writing notes. By using AI, doctors can reduce time on paperwork and make visits more productive. If you’re anything like me, remembering everything you talk about in an appointment is difficult. After this visit, I had an instant summary and follow-up materials to help me remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like the idea of using AI to monitor symptoms like gait issues. That’s long been a challenge for me, and it’s hard for me to see gait changes in myself. Having a consistent and objective “eye” could be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI cannot be used alone in diagnosing or treating a disease like Parkinson’s. But if it can help extend the reach and consistency of evaluations and give patients more accurate assessments of their disease, I welcome it.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal98tnk001b3b76b5ihju9o@published"&gt;One of my best friends is going through a difficult patch in her marriage. They have two young kids, both work full-time, and she definitely carries the mental load. She has said they don’t communicate well, and that she is open to marriage counseling. However, she said it’s one thing too many for her to take on, so for them to go, he has to make the effort to do it. Apparently, he has suggested counseling in the past but never followed through. I think if they don’t, they are headed toward divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal98tpk001c3b76z6mngq1s@published"&gt;Should I tell my friend’s husband he needs to do this, or stay out of it and watch them struggle? I’m not really friends with him, but we are cordial when we see each other. I don’t really want to get in the middle of it, but I also know she will lean heavily on me if they ever did get divorced, so part of me feels like I should tell him for my own sake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="8" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal98tuh001f3b76d6c8v541@published"&gt;Nope. Don’t say anything. For a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;ol data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-list/instances/cmal98ysa001j3b76ci2ii4zk@published" class="slate-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While counseling can be great, it isn’t a magic fix for a marriage, and it doesn’t guarantee that a couple will stay together. If it’s going to help, both people have to be invested in the process. Your friend and her husband lack the collective energy or willingness to make an appointment, which suggests they’re at least a bit checked out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is sort of like how a high school student who needs major hand-holding to schedule their SATs, write essays, and apply may not actually be ready to succeed in college, where they’ll have to manage all their work independently. This couple’s failure to book an appointment without outside encouragement makes me think neither of them is currently in the right frame of mind to work hard to repair their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He probably wouldn’t take your suggestion anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a secret you then have to keep from your good friend is asking for trouble. Especially a secret that involves private conversations with her husband. Even if your intentions are pure, there’s a lot of potential for it to become messy and hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if he opens up and tells you that for him to want to stay married, she’d need to get rid of two-thirds of the throw pillows in the house, or stop leaving so much hair in the bathtub? Are you going to keep passing messages back and forth indefinitely? You could get in over your head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9a3zd001o3b76qihfdgdc@published"&gt;What you should do instead is develop a plan for how you want to be there for your friend during this time, whether it turns out to be a long rough patch in her marriage or a divorce. I can tell you’re worried she’ll demand too much of you, or will expect you to help her figure out how to set up her new life if they split up. So think about what kind of support you’d like to provide—meaning, what will make you feel good and not resentful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9a9th001t3b763pin6ukb@published"&gt;Get ahead of the situation and do that now, before you’re exhausted from your 12th session with her as an unpaid therapist or before she’s asked to come sleep on your couch while she looks for a new place, needs money for a lawyer, or is newly single and wants you to be her wing woman when she goes out looking for dates. Do it instead of just bracing for her overwhelming need.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="145" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9bjxs00233b76r7bgigkl@published"&gt;I’m a 24-year-old woman and was born as the product of my dad’s affair with my mom. His wife, “Ava,” took him back after finding out because she said they had to stay together for their children. I lived with Mom most of the time and spent occasional weekends and holidays at Dad’s with Ava and my half-sisters. Ava hated me. She fed me food I was allergic to multiple times or fed me nothing if I wouldn’t eat the allergens, screamed at me for every little thing, and would give my half-sisters extra love, attention, and random gifts while smirking at me. She told me regularly I was going to be a failure like my mother (and this is how I learned of my mom’s drug problems!). Dad was useless and only spoke nicely to me when the others were out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9bjxt00243b76qc5jpcxg@published"&gt;The only person who was kind to me was “Katherine,” my half-sister, who is near my age. She shared her presents and food, and we saw each other independently as teens. She’s a wonderful person, and we’re close as adults. We’re true sisters. Her older sister never acknowledges me. My mom died last year of an overdose and has left me a surprisingly large sum of money along with her house. It seems she won a lot gambling after I moved out at 18, because we were poor growing up. It’s been a lot to take in, honestly—my grief is complicated after years of neglect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9bjxu00253b767qucnyqq@published"&gt;So far, I’ve used the money to pay off debts, and I mean to buy a house. Katherine has been really struggling since the unplanned birth of her child, and I wanted to help her, so I’ve given her $10,000 along with letting her stay in my mom’s old house while she finds her feet. It feels great to pay back her kindness! The problem is that Dad and Ava have found out. They want “their share” of the money and feel my mom owed them for years of free child care. Ava called me first, pretending to be friendly, then threatening legal action against me! Dad has called me crying, wanting to know why I don’t care about my family anymore. He keeps bringing up that he gave me his old car in my teens as proof that he’s done a lot for me, and talking about all the child support he paid “despite how it hurt Ava.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmala9bua00563b760ydbksno@published"&gt;Prudie, I don’t owe them anything, right? Should I give a one-off gift to stop them from harassing me? Ava has sobbed to me that I don’t understand how hard it was for her, and that she’s sorry for taking things out on me. She says I can’t hold on to long-ago grievances forever. Is there any merit to this point, and can you advise on how I move forward?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="149" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9bjxx00283b76anr9mqi3@published"&gt;You can hold on to long-ago grievances for a lifetime, if you choose. Especially if they’re about the way you were mistreated as a child. Even if you didn’t have this grievance, your dad and Ava wouldn’t be entitled to your money. You don’t owe people for raising you, and especially not for raising you on occasional weekends and holidays during which they intentionally fed you food that would trigger your allergies. The fact that they call what they did “free child care” when you were just a kid spending time with her father says a lot about how they see you: not as their child or a real member of their family. It’s also worth noting that your dad and Ava didn’t show any interest in repairing their relationship with you until they thought it might lead to a windfall for them. Their gold-digging couldn’t be more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmal9bjxz00293b76lqa4akwn@published"&gt;Absolutely do not give them a cent. And block their numbers. I don’t say that lightly, but the absence of any real relationship combined with their threats of legal action makes this a pretty easy call. Enjoy your new house, your relationship with Katherine, and your savings account.&lt;/p&gt;

But a more effective tactic, if you’re actually hoping the noise will stop, might be a note that says, “Hi from upstairs! I wanted to let you know that I can hear your nightly fights, including ones about some very personal subjects. I know apartment living means putting up with some noise, but if there’s any way you could keep your voices down, I would appreciate it. And I imagine there are some topics you don’t want the whole building to know about. &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;Thanks!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The 10th- and 12th-graders’ use of pouches in the 12 months and 30 days before the surveys also increased year to year.

Among them: malaria, dengue fever, West Nile virus, yellow fever, and Zika virus. More than 700,000 people die each year from vector-borne diseases, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SJHRTU6YEJAQPGAFILDBHJP7EY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Controlling them is key to keeping Florida survivable for 23 million residents and 143 million annual visitors. The Anastasia Mosquito Control District of St. Johns County, founded in 1948, is one of the best-known agencies dedicated to mosquito control.

The district’s board said it makes sense to educate the public about things people can do to control mosquitoes: clean birdbaths every few days, empty the dog’s outdoor water bowl daily, dump out anything that holds standing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDIGQDK7G5E33JLRCVACA6KOOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To get past the consternation over what critics called a bug museum, the name became the Disease Vector Education Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5YH2R4KIJ5A57DRBIWAE3ILPVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Monzon said more than 11,000 people visited in the first year, many of them part of school groups.

He likes the final results.

			&lt;p&gt;A migraine drug called ubrogepant doesn't just reduce the severity of a migraine attack – it also dials down the non-headache symptoms in the prodrome: the hours leading up to the main event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the conclusion reached after a large  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="161019" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; tested hundreds of migraine patients taking the medication at the onset of prodrome symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ubrogepant-oral-route/description/drg-20481621"&gt;ubrogepant&lt;/a&gt; might be effective for treating the entire migraine as it evolves, rather than just the head pain – and narrows down the mechanisms behind the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migraine is a neurological affliction that affects an estimated &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-022-00763-1"&gt;14 to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the global population, yet it remains poorly understood, and difficult to treat effectively. It's known for its searing, debilitating head pain, but the anatomy of a migraine is much more &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/symptoms-causes/syc-20360201"&gt;complex and longer-lasting&lt;/a&gt; than just the head pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly, a migraine consists of three to four stages: the prodrome, during which the patient experiences symptoms such as light sensitivity, nausea, neck pain, and brain fog; aura, characterized by vision disturbances, including blind spots and flashing lights; the headache attack itself; and the postdrome, characterized by brain fog and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oBvGbn1MuPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put together, this sequence of events can last up to &lt;a href="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/how-long-does-a-migraine-attack-last/"&gt;more than a week&lt;/a&gt;. It's quite unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most treatments focus on the headache portion, since it's the most debilitating. Even studies on treatments designed to be taken during the prodrome phase have concentrated on blocking the headache, rather than treating the prodrome itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by neurologist Peter Goadsby of Kings College London, a team of researchers has now conducted a trial on whether or not ubrogepant, a migtainte treatment available in the US under the brand name Ubrelvy, also works on the prodrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists want to know not just how to treat the entirety of a migraine – although that's a desired goal – but to help determine what drives a migraine attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It has long been argued whether migraine is primarily a disease of the brain or of peripheral, specifically vascular, origin," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03679-7"&gt;the researchers write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;. "The new data firmly support a brain origin for migraine attacks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubrogepant is a drug that does not prevent migraine attacks, but reduces the severity of the pain associated with an attack. It belongs to a class of drugs called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin_gene-related_peptide_receptor_antagonist"&gt;calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists.&lt;/a&gt; Ubrogepant, and other drugs belonging to the same class, block the action of CGRP, a peptide associated with migraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goadsby and his colleagues recruited hundreds of migraine patients for a double-blind study. The 438 study participants, aged between 18 and 75, and all with at least a one-year history of migraine, were put in groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group was given ubrogepant at the onset of prodrome symptoms; the other was given a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="161019" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. Then, during a second event at least seven days later, the groups switched. The patients initially given the drug were given the placebo, and vice versa. Neither the researchers nor the participants knew which group was receiving which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking the drug or the placebo, the participants were tasked with reporting changes in their symptoms, which included photo- and phonophobia, dizziness, fatigue, neck pain or stiffness, and brain fog. The patients taking the drug experienced a significantly higher reduction in their symptoms than the patients taking the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_nA-IfOyp8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hour after taking ubrogepant, patients reported brain fog easing. After two hours, photophobia, or sensitivity to light, decreased. After three hours, neck problems eased. Between four and 24 hours after taking the drug, phonophobia (sensitivity to sound) and dizziness lessened, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that CGRP receptor antagonists might be effective at treating prodromal migraine symptoms, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As premonitory symptoms can be disabling, their treatment alone is clinically relevant, beyond the consideration that treatment during the prodrome prevents headache onset and improves function over 24 to 48 hours, as demonstrated in the primary analysis of the study," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03679-7"&gt;the researchers write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition: "Broadly, the findings of the clinical trial support imaging studies that have identified central nervous system sites as the locus of initiation of a migraine attack."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several routes forward from here. The study didn't look at the effects of ubrogepant on the aura and postdrome phases of migraine, which could warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future work could also probe further to try and narrow down the cause of migraine, and determine whether CGRP receptor antagonists might offer relief for the entire course of a migraine event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03679-7"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ancient tomb in Greece does not hold the remains of Philip II, the father of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/39997-alexander-the-great.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/39997-alexander-the-great.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alexander the Great&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as some scholars think it does, a new study suggests. Instead, it contains the remains of a younger man who died before Philip II did, archaeologists propose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the July 2025 issue of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106234" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2025.106234" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of Archaeological Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also revealed that the tomb is the burial place of a young woman and six infants. Prior to this study researchers knew of the existence of the man, woman and at least one infant in the tomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have long scrutinized the tomb, which was discovered in 1977 at the site of Vergina (also called Aigai), in northern Greece. Known as "Tomb I," it is located beneath a large tumulus (burial mound) that has a shrine on top. It's near several other tombs, which are thought to hold other members of Alexander the Great's family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scholars have suggested that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1510906112" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1510906112" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tomb I held the burial of Philip II&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although many other scholars believe that he was most likely &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.2307/630280" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.2307/630280" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;buried in Tomb II&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was not studied in the newly published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that Tomb I has no doorway and was sealed off in ancient times, it's likely that the man and woman were buried together, at the same time, the researchers noted. Radiocarbon dating of their remains indicates that the man and woman lived sometime between 388 and 356 B.C., the researchers wrote in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of their bones and teeth suggested that the man in the tomb was between 25 and 35 years old at the time of his death. Philip II, in comparison, was assassinated in 336 B.C., at about age 46.

Namely, the researchers wondered, who are the man and woman buried in the tomb? To investigate, the team did a strontium and stable carbon analysis of the skeletal and tooth remains, which can provide information on a person's diet and where they lived as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man likely spent his childhood away from the Macedonian capital of Pella, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast of Vergina, the isotopic tests revealed. The woman — who died between the ages of 18 and 25, according to an anatomical analysis — likely spent her childhood living in or near Pella. Although their identities remain unknown, the tomb's opulence indicates that they were elite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We assume that he must be a Macedon King who ruled and died decades before Philip II's assassination," Maniatis said. It's unclear which king that was, but candidates include Alexander II (reigned circa 370 to 368 B.C.) and Perdiccas III (reigned from 365 to 359 B.C.), the team wrote in the study. Both rulers had tumultuous reigns that dealt with war and infighting within the ancient kingdom of Macedon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="where-is-philip-ii-buried-3"&gt;Where is Philip II buried?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maniatis said the team is not certain where Philip II is buried. Many scholars have suggested that Tomb II at Vergina holds his cremated remains. Previous research done by other scholars has shown that Tomb II is a "two-chamber vaulted tomb found unlooted, with all the grave goods intact, containing the cremated remains of a male" who was around 44 years old when he died, Maniatis noted. However, he emphasized that Tomb II was not studied as part of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://duth.academia.edu/AntonisBartsiokas" target="_blank" data-url="https://duth.academia.edu/AntonisBartsiokas" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Antonis Bartsiokas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor emeritus of physical anthropology and paleoanthropology at the Democritus University of Thrace and one of the researchers who has &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-tomb-really-does-hold-alexander-the-greats-father-controversial-study-claims" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-tomb-really-does-hold-alexander-the-greats-father-controversial-study-claims"&gt;&lt;u&gt;suggested Philip II is buried in Tomb I&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told Live Science that he and other supporters of this theory will reply in a journal article of their own and don't want to comment further at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to answer first to the journal," Bartsiokas told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="alexander-the-great-quiz-how-well-do-you-know-the-famous-king-and-conqueror-from-the-ancient-world-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/alexander-the-great-quiz-how-well-do-you-know-the-famous-king-and-conqueror-from-the-ancient-world" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/alexander-the-great-quiz-how-well-do-you-know-the-famous-king-and-conqueror-from-the-ancient-world"&gt;Alexander the Great quiz&lt;/a&gt;: How well do you know the famous king and conqueror from the ancient world?&lt;/h2&gt;

Using single-cell RNA sequencing on over 430,000 cells from 59 patients, researchers identified three new glioblastoma cell states and classified tumors into three overarching cellular ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of samples before and after treatment showed how genetic factors and therapy shape tumor progression and resistance, with some tumors becoming more aggressive or hypoxic. These findings offer a roadmap for future therapies targeting glioblastoma’s adaptive strategies and cellular diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Cell Precision:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 430,000 tumor cells revealed new glioblastoma states and ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolving Resistance:&lt;/strong&gt; Tumors adapt between diagnosis and recurrence, often becoming more aggressive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may guide therapies targeting radiation or chemo-resistant cell states.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pair of research articles published May 9 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/em&gt; shed new light on the cellular complexity of glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain cancer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team of scientists, including researchers at the Yale Cancer Center, analyzed tumor samples from 59 glioblastoma patients to better understand how diverse cell types within a tumor change over time and in response to standard therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109807"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Glioblastoma is different from patient to patient and its cellular composition is varied even within the same tumor. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings identify previously unrecognized patterns of cancer cell activity and may help guide future treatment strategies for this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work described in the two articles was supervised by five senior researchers including Roel Verhaak, PhD, Harvey and Kate Cushing Professor of Neurosurgery at Yale School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His research has long focused on the identification and characterization of gene expression subtypes in glioblastoma. The current articles build on Verhaak’s prior research by leveraging the latest genomic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using high-resolution technologies that enable us to measure gene expression at the single-cell level, we are now able to specifically pinpoint characteristics of glioblastoma cells and the mechanisms behind disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new work applies these technologies at scale, revealing the heterogeneity and evolution of this aggressive disease,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The multilayered transcriptional architecture of glioblastoma ecosystems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first article presents a detailed analysis of 121 primary and recurrent glioblastoma samples from the 59 patients to discover cancer cell types not previously identified in earlier, smaller studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The large data set included about 430,000 cells and led to the identification of three novel glioblastoma cell “states,” in addition to confirming previously identified ones, that may contribute to a glioblastoma’s ability to adapt and evade therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is different from patient to patient and its cellular composition is varied even within the same tumor. Despite this variability, the researchers found some common cellular programs across patients that are influenced by specific gene mutations and a tumor’s surrounding cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These common patterns define three overarching “ecosystems” that reflect distinct cellular communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By dissecting glioblastoma at the single-cell resolution, we’re beginning to understand how individual cancer cells function collectively as an ecosystem. Mapping this cellular landscape gives us critical insights into how glioblastomas develop, evolve, and ultimately resist treatment,” says Kevin Johnson, PhD, research scientist in the Department of Neurosurgery at Yale School of Medicine and co-first author of the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Deciphering the longitudinal trajectories of glioblastoma ecosystems by integrative single-cell genomics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second article examined how the glioblastoma cellular ecosystems change between a patient’s initial diagnosis and disease recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings both added to, and reinforced, the existing complex picture of varied glioblastoma cells and how they evolve and develop resistance to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recurrent glioblastomas retain the cellular makeup associated with the primary tumor, but some do not. For example, tumors with higher levels of the gene &lt;em&gt;MGMT&lt;/em&gt;, which is related to chemotherapy resistance, can transition to a more aggressive form when they recur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another subgroup, with genetic patterns linked to therapeutic radiation resistance, displayed a low-oxygen (hypoxic) profile in the recurring tumor that may assist glioblastoma cells in surviving standard radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the insights from these articles mark a major step toward decoding glioblastoma’s notorious complexity and treatment resistance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The articles noted that further genetic studies are still needed to reveal additional recurrence patterns that could inform treatment decisions that improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for this work was sourced worldwide and includes the GBM CARE initiative; the National Cancer Institute through the National Institutes of Health (awards R01CA237208, R21NS114873, R21CA256575, and P30CA034196); the Luxembourg National Research Fund; and Yale University.

Instead, she was forced to sleep upright in a recliner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lying down, they cautioned, could trigger more ruptures and internal bleeding that might flood her lungs with fluid — ultimately suffocating her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Loyda Cordero Galiero, 39, was left fighting for her life after she switched from smoking to vaping, believing she had made a healthy choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also could not do any exercise in case the strain burst the air-sacs, even something as simple as cooking or carrying groceries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lungs are made up of tiny balloon-like structures called alveoli, or air sacs, which are responsible for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When these sacs are damaged or burst — as can happen with severe inflammation or pressure changes — it can lead to bleeding, fluid buildup, and a dangerous loss of lung function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Galiero said she was a pack-a-day smoker before switching to vaping. But once she started using e-cigarettes, she would puff 'like crazy'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'With a cigarette, you can put it out and do what you've got to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But with a vape it's like a cell phone — it's literally stuck in your hand 24/7 and you're hitting it even when you don't want to hit it just because it's there.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'It's horrible. Vaping is 100 percent more dangerous than cigarettes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say vaping can be healthier than smoking because it doesn't involve burning tobacco, which is what produces the most harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But physicians also say that using vapes regularly — particularly those not approved by the FDA — can cause complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoke from the devices contains propylene glycol — made from petroleum — that can inflame the airways, leading blood to leak into the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Galiero didn't say what brand she was using, or what flavors — but many are attracted to vapes for their appealing and often fruity tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that she was 'so proud' when she had made the switch from smoking to vaping, and was never once warned about the potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After she was rushed to the ER in March this year, when she choked on a sip of a drink, doctors diagnosed her with pulmonary bullae — or when large air-filled spaces open up in the lungs when lung tissue is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was told she would need to quit vaping before having surgery, which would likely involve removing fluid-filled areas of her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Galiero, from New York state, is pictured above in her hospital bed after doctors said that vaping had put her life at risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After quitting, she underwent surgery on April 30 — and is still there now recovering from the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Galiero said: '&lt;span&gt;My doctor said that my lung collapsed because they were building up with the liquid from my vape and one of the pulmonary bullae ended up rupturing.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added: &lt;/span&gt;'My esophagus is out of place to where the pulmonary bullae sac is putting pressure onto that and if that ruptures, it could cause... internal bleeding which could kill me instantly.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking before the surgery, she added: 'It's causing a lot of problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I lay down when sleeping instead of sitting up I can choke to death on my own spit or I can suffocate and die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I literally have to sit up in bed or on a recliner when I sleep because I'm no longer allowed to sleep lying down until after the surgery — it's pretty much a life or death situation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say that it is healthier not to use cigarettes or vapes than to use either of the devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They warn that many vapes sold in the US are not FDA-approved, and have been shipped into the US from other countries — often China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The mother-of-two underwent grueling surgery to repair her lungs, and is now recovering from it in the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaping was initially approved in the US as a method to help people quit smoking, with some experts saying it was '95 percent less dangerous'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this is dependent on how often people use the devices, with many reporting that they puff on them far more than they ever smoked cigarettes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 6.5 percent of US adults vape, according to the CDC, equivalent to about 16.7million people in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It isn't clear how many are sickened by the devices every year, but the CDC reports that between 2019 and 2020 there were 2,800 hospitalizations and 68 deaths due to lung damage from the devices. Numbers now are likely much higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FDA has authorized 34 tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarette devices to date, which underwent rigorous scientific review. It has not approved any vapes with fruity flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 14:11:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQZVcwTnN2TzZCRlF1Wm9VaGtKbWxxb19iU0JobTIzMVJCOUEyMU5MX3JobmxqUXp2SjlfcnF3SzhBakFxT3NHT0RFOUZjRHJqTGpRMlM3VHV6QVJhSi1kZUNqbGlyVGRqdlRuOVJOVDZobGdsMWpDNi1Zb193TkVUYldLdUNjak1odHR1dklDczBGeEJqSUsxOVhjM2V3cmxxZWlpMlh1RkZvRDFfb253TmJNb9IBuAFBVV95cUxNS1NuOWhUdDR3S3lVbGZ1UkROTFZlZ0ZBY0l2NmhwVDJiZ3ZNLTN2N194bzh4N0FMWmhlTS00WlFJNHAwYnBuWjZDY3hIQ0phN2lZVFB6Y3dYSWNpSWhuX2tDcE5LVTMtZXFSd3NqVFhuajFRNC1FMlNLWHJ4RlB3S2x0Y2VzemR2TkRZRi1INURxOF83TWdSc1BHQWI5OU9WX2llM3NaT3ltYXQyMHlEWEowWm9WUkxT</guid></item><item><title>15个月大的婴儿可以为他们从未见过的物体学习单词- SciTechDaily | 15-Month-Old Babies Can Learn Words for Objects They’ve Never Seen - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPeUN0U2EwSFd5cFVMSFFmVEsyUlA2OVk0SDRVV2RiNlVEZTB3QkRMYlZ2ZjVpSnRydFg5c3ZhWG0xNXlKV1I4MU5obnlfemEzd3RjWWFRMVg0RzF0Mm5zRl9DaDdCMkJsdWlncEJrQl9rZEVGQmFYS3FFNGdSTEdRQmxMbHJOZ1A1Z2l3YXdoLW5yUWUtOWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 14:06:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPeUN0U2EwSFd5cFVMSFFmVEsyUlA2OVk0SDRVV2RiNlVEZTB3QkRMYlZ2ZjVpSnRydFg5c3ZhWG0xNXlKV1I4MU5obnlfemEzd3RjWWFRMVg0RzF0Mm5zRl9DaDdCMkJsdWlncEJrQl9rZEVGQmFYS3FFNGdSTEdRQmxMbHJOZ1A1Z2l3YXdoLW5yUWUtOWc</guid></item><item><title>吃更多与更高健康风险相关的超加工食品-神经科学新闻 | Eating More Ultra-Processed Food Linked to Higher Health Risks - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE5tOHNLUUJIVWxnRkF2c3l2NTREQ0g4SWxSQkxmRVJ3dHlCMmxuMVpuWUNfOE1MTzhwVWVWM25wdk1mYXRPcUtJampvYjd2cnkzdzRqNGx6WnZ1MzMxeFNhc1c2UlZIbTJSRzhOQW5KcWVIeEt5ZUpV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A major new analysis of over 8 million adults reveals that each additional 100 grams per day of ultra-processed food intake significantly raises the risk of hypertension, cardiovascular events, digestive disease, cancer, and death. Ultra-processed foods—like sugary drinks, chips, and packaged snacks—are high in sugar, salt, and additives, and low in essential nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found a clear dose-response relationship: the more consumed, the greater the risk. Experts call for clearer labeling, public health education, and a shift toward minimally processed, nutrient-rich diets to counter this trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every 100g/day adds risk:&lt;/strong&gt; +14.5% for hypertension, +5.9% for heart events, +19.5% for digestive disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low in nutrients, high in additives:&lt;/strong&gt; These foods are calorie-dense but nutritionally poor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global review:&lt;/strong&gt; Analysis included data from 8.3 million adults across four continents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American Academy of Cardiology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumption of ultra-processed foods, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, potato chips and packaged cookies, may be associated with adverse health outcomes, according to research being presented at the ACC Asia 2025, together with SCS 36&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Annual Scientific Meeting taking place May 9-11 in Singapore. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This risk for hypertension, other cardiovascular events, cancer, digestive diseases, mortality and more, increased with every 100 grams of ultra-processed foods consumed each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109803"&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;According to the researchers, common examples of ultra-processed foods include commercially produced breads, sugar-sweetened beverages, potato chips, chocolate confectionery, candy, packaged cookies, etc. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultra-processed foods are characterized by high sugar, high salt, and other non-nutritive components, exhibiting low nutritional density yet high caloric content,” said Xiao Liu, MD, with the department of cardiology at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These products may contribute to adverse health outcomes through multiple mechanisms, including but not limited to dysregulation of blood lipid profiles, alterations in gut microbiota composition, promotion of obesity, induction of systemic inflammation, exacerbation of oxidative stress and impairment of insulin sensitivity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The systematic review included 41 prospective cohort studies spanning the Americas, Europe, Asia and Oceania assessing the association between ultra-processed foods and health outcomes prior to April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the studies involved a total of 8,286,940 adult patients aged 18 years or older from the general population (30.8% male, 69.2% female).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All included studies used the Nova food classification system to define ultra-processed foods as industrially manufactured food products derived from natural foods or other organic constituents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These products undergo extensive multi-stage processing and typically contain significant quantities of food additives, including preservatives, colorants and flavor enhancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, common examples of ultra-processed foods include commercially produced breads, sugar-sweetened beverages, potato chips, chocolate confectionery, candy, packaged cookies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found ultra-processed food consumption was associated with hypertension, cardiovascular events, cancer, digestive diseases and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each additional 100 g/day of ultra-processed food consumption was associated with a 14.5% higher risk of hypertension, 5.9% increased risk of cardiovascular events, 1.2% increased risk of cancer, 19.5% higher risk of digestive diseases and 2.6% higher risk of all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also observed increased risk of obesity/overweight, metabolic syndromes/diabetes and depression/anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence included in the analysis. GRADE assessment indicated high to moderate certainty for most outcomes, except low certainty for metabolic syndrome/diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clinicians should clearly explain that ultra-processed foods are typically high in added sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats, while being low in fiber, essential vitamins, and other protective nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This nutritional imbalance contributes to a wide range of adverse health outcomes,” Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Emerging evidence suggests a dose-response relationship between ultra-processed food consumption and negative health outcomes—meaning the more ultra-processed foods consumed, the greater the health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, reducing ultra-processed foods intake, even modestly, may offer measurable health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, governments may consider implementing measures to reduce the consumption of ultra-processed foods and mitigate the associated health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some suggested measures include establishing stringent food labeling regulations, requiring manufacturers to provide explicit and comprehensive ingredient disclosures—particularly detailing all additives present in ultra-processed foods, Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians should also encourage patients to gradually lower their ultra-processed food intake, replacing them with more nutritious, minimally processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study was limited in generalizability and comparability by different definitions of ultra-processed foods, Liu said the findings are not just about what to avoid, but also about what to embrace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence has linked health benefits to whole foods, simple ingredients, and culturally appropriate healthy eating patterns such as the Mediterranean or DASH diet, he said. High quality studies about this topic are further needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#046e666b7d68656a60446567672a6b7663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julie Boyland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://acc.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julie Boyland – American Academy of Cardiology&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at ACC Asia 2025&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 13:59:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5tOHNLUUJIVWxnRkF2c3l2NTREQ0g4SWxSQkxmRVJ3dHlCMmxuMVpuWUNfOE1MTzhwVWVWM25wdk1mYXRPcUtJampvYjd2cnkzdzRqNGx6WnZ1MzMxeFNhc1c2UlZIbTJSRzhOQW5KcWVIeEt5ZUpV</guid></item><item><title>空腹喝椰子水改变我的消化系统- VOGUE时尚杂志 | Drinking Coconut Water on an Empty Stomach Changed My Digestion - Vogue</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBiN0VMNXNXRWJfaUEyTUVpODBRZFJnR3BYVGZWUlhtSDFIMXlCcmx3d2V1MlBtSk5aemFaRFVwRWlKQnhpdFM5UG1ZczZkcklFaE1QQkowbFBCREZOUUJlQ1ZYQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a kid, summers didn’t mean exotic getaways or amusement park visits. Instead, my family spent time idling in a hammock under a dense canopy of trees, napping in the dappled sunshine. When &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/signs-youre-not-drinking-enough-water" target="_blank"&gt;thirst&lt;/a&gt; (or even &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/dehydrated-what-to-do-about-it" target="_blank"&gt;dehydration&lt;/a&gt;) struck, I’d turn to fresh coconut water, sipped straight from the source, hacked open with a sickle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That memory always flashes through my mind as I rip open a packaged coconut water, one that swears that it’s “not made from concentrate.” The travails of adulthood mean that breakfast has been demoted from a priority of “maybe” to something that actually happens around noon. After countless failed attempts to overhaul my morning routine, I decided that coconut water would be my non-negotiable first sip of the day—keeping my electrolytes up until I could sit down for a proper meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds simple enough—deceptively so. Cycling through the packaged options in the market, I find few that appeal to my palate ("Too sweet!" "Too salty!" "Too… nothing?"). Determined to recreate the magic of my grandfather’s farm, I land on a fresh coconut delivery subscription—and strike gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now reunited with the subtly sweet, slightly nutty taste of real coconut water, it’s become a mainstay in my morning routine. Through stomach upsets and early morning calls, a chilled glass sits steadfastly beside my laptop—the low-maintenance change in my life that has helped me power through the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best time of day to drink coconut water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I spoke of my experience with integrative nutritionist Payal Kothari, she confirmed what I suspected. "When consumed early in the morning on an empty stomach, coconut water helps kickstart digestion, balance pH levels, and detoxify the system," she explains. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38278200/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that the drink is anti-inflammatory and feeds a healthy gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond flushing out toxins from the body, it also serves as a natural treasure trove of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/foods-high-in-potassium" target="_blank"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/magnesium-facts" target="_blank"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, and other essential minerals that support electrolyte balance—all of which help dial down the risk of dehydration “Its hydrating properties can also lead to clearer skin, as it helps maintain skin moisture and support detoxification,” adds Vedika Premani, a clinical dietician at Sir H N Reliance Foundation Hospital in Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With temperatures rising, coconut water is an even handier ally against the summer heat, replenishing fluids lost through the blistering days of summer. “It’s a natural rehydration drink that quickly restores the body's hydration levels,” says Premani. Unlike sugary sports drinks, it keeps you refreshed without the added artificial sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much coconut water is too much?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While coconut water is an easy summer staple, it’s worth remembering that you can have too much of a good thing. Though there’s no strict daily limit, experts recommend keeping it to one or two servings (200 to 300ml each) per day, increasing to three servings in extreme heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 13:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBiN0VMNXNXRWJfaUEyTUVpODBRZFJnR3BYVGZWUlhtSDFIMXlCcmx3d2V1MlBtSk5aemFaRFVwRWlKQnhpdFM5UG1ZczZkcklFaE1QQkowbFBCREZOUUJlQ1ZYQQ</guid></item><item><title>您的洗衣机可能有助于抗生素耐药性细菌的传播- SciTechDaily | Your Washing Machine Might Be Helping Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Spread - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPMlJFWjA0Q1ZlbUd0ZzlsVG42dUtsNjVyNW1UZVkzS0NpbVFBLTRIZmR4SjdrVHpIQjlPSUt5OGczOHE2N3cxSGJPZWlYYVIzRkVYS3hDdV9jRm9aSXVTODlqNnYxR0ttQ0tQZ3REdTJIZ1F0dGV0dUlrbzAtX0I3M1dpLVlkanVnNFFpUGVpRXo3ZFFXM3pIVXp6dFc5OW1MSHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 13:16:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPMlJFWjA0Q1ZlbUd0ZzlsVG42dUtsNjVyNW1UZVkzS0NpbVFBLTRIZmR4SjdrVHpIQjlPSUt5OGczOHE2N3cxSGJPZWlYYVIzRkVYS3hDdV9jRm9aSXVTODlqNnYxR0ttQ0tQZ3REdTJIZ1F0dGV0dUlrbzAtX0I3M1dpLVlkanVnNFFpUGVpRXo3ZFFXM3pIVXp6dFc5OW1MSHc</guid></item><item><title>过敏和缓解过敏的产品可能会产生意想不到的副作用- KHOU | Allergies and products to relieve them could have unexpected side effects - KHOU</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxONmxoOVhyWWdmbWZKM2VMa3FOa1ZPeXNqejUtRXNQanBGQWRsazFyUjZHejJVZlZzNDVybzVCMWZtdTNack1ncDQxZ3pybkkzc3R4UV92aHFSUmFpVWhZSjdnZE9FTnNFTFNzNEpxQUhLWWFaTk5hSDdnSE91bXdQam5IcW5nbDZlak41SWpmVVV3ODRpMUd2VjZGWERNdng4ZzZPQ1pnX0FGQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;If you suffer from allergies, no doubt you feel them in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — This past weekend, the pollen really spiked, so allergy sufferers should stay on top of the meds. For many families, these allergies mean more than just sneezing. It also means turning to inhaler use. But that quick relief can have unexpected side effects.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Eventually, my son's allergies got so bad that he was coughing and couldn't catch his breath and my wife and I didn't know what to do," said Kevin Foux, whose son suffers from allergies. "We ended up in the ER actually, and that's when they prescribed us the inhaler."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In children, there's something called the allergic triad or allergic march," said pediatrician Dr. Janet Pate.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pate said this is when a child starts with allergies that leads to eczema on the skin, then a chronic runny nose and finally to asthma. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians are prescribing inhalers not just for asthma but for allergy-related respiratory issues.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're trying to reduce the inflammation in the lungs to prevent mucus plugs building up in the lungs that can lead to pneumonia and reduce the bronchospasm," she said. "So the spasms of the little airways in the lungs that lead to wheezing and your typical asthma sounds in the nighttime cough reduction in the energy level of the child."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common allergies can lead to greater issues if left untreated, including your teeth and gum care. In Houston, we have pollen all year round, and pediatric dentist Dr. Julie Longoria says allergies aren't your only concern.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We find that our kids with asthma and really high allergies tend to have more cavities because their mouth is drier, so the bacteria is allowed to like really work," she said. "Bacteria love a dry environment, so really we want to make sure that when we're hydrating them, we're doing it with mostly water and also any time they have that medication, that we're rinsing after with water and making sure that our hygiene is really up there, flossing and brushing every single day, twice a day with the brushing fluoride toothpaste." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pate also says if your child has really high allergies and you've tried the antihistamines, it may be time to go see an allergist.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new study highlights a perhaps unexpected way to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease: getting vaccinated against shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/leading-cause-of-death-in-us-claims-a-life-every-34-seconds"&gt;Cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; – involving the heart or blood vessels – is by far humanity's leading cause of death. It kills about 18 million people globally each year, mostly via &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-8-essential-ways-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is a daunting public health problem, medical science has revealed ways to lower risk: A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experiment-reveals-how-the-mediterranean-diet-works-at-the-cellular-level"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; helps, as do exercising daily, getting enough sleep, managing stress, and avoiding smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the new study, covering data on more than 1.2 million people in South Korea over the age of 50, those who received a shingles vaccine showed a 23 percent lower risk of cardiovascular events overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This protection lasted for up to eight years, with the greatest reduction in risk observed two to three years after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect was more pronounced in men, people younger than 60, and those with unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, drinking alcohol, or inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shingles vaccination is already widely recommended for adults over 50 to protect against the viral disease, known for its painful skin rash and blisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shingles is caused by the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_zoster_virus"&gt;varicella-zoster virus&lt;/a&gt; – the culprit behind chickenpox. After people recover from chickenpox, typically in childhood, the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="160775" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; can remain dormant in nerve cells for years or decades, then abruptly reactivate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immediate effects of shingles are bad enough, but while the rash usually fades in a few weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ramsay-hunt-syndrome-justin-bieber-s-rare-medical-condition-explained"&gt;the disease can be insidiously persistent&lt;/a&gt;, explains pediatrician researcher Dong Keon Yon from Kyung Hee University in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Shingles causes a painful rash and can lead to serious complications, especially in older adults and those with weak immune systems," Yon &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/shingles-vaccine-lowers-the-risk-of-heart-disease-for-up-to-eight-years"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "Research shows that, without vaccination, about 30 percent of people may develop shingles in their lifetime."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common complication is &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postherpetic-neuralgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20376588"&gt;long-term nerve pain&lt;/a&gt; that can last for months or years. Shingles near the eyes can also lead to vision loss, and some people develop lasting neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161050" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161050" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/A-Course-of-Shingles-diagram.jpg" alt="An illustration showing a dormant virus awakening and traveling through nerve fibers to skin." class="size-full wp-image-161050" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/A-Course-of-Shingles-diagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/A-Course-of-Shingles-diagram-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/A-Course-of-Shingles-diagram-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161050" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Progression of shingles. A cluster of small bumps (1) turns into blisters (2). The blisters fill with pus, break open (3), crust over (4), and disappear over 4–5 weeks. A painful condition called postherpetic neuralgia can sometimes occur, thought to be caused by damage to the nerves (5). (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_Course_of_Shingles_diagram.png"&gt;Renee Gordon/Public Domain/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggests &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-powerful-link-between-chickenpox-and-stroke-risk-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;shingles also raises stroke&lt;/a&gt; and heart attack risk. "In addition to the rash, shingles has been linked to a higher risk of heart problems, so we wanted to find out if getting vaccinated could lower this risk," Yon &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/shingles-vaccine-lowers-the-risk-of-heart-disease-for-up-to-eight-years"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers merged data from several South Korean government agencies, ultimately studying more than 1.2 million people. Spanning 2012 to 2021, this included information on vaccination status as well as cardiovascular health and other relevant factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vaccines-have-saved-a-staggering-154-million-lives-in-the-last-50-years"&gt;Vaccinated people&lt;/a&gt; had a 23 percent lower risk of cardiovascular events overall, including a 22 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease, a 26 percent lower risk of heart failure, and a 26 percent lower risk of a major cardiovascular event like stroke or heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The shingles vaccine may help lower the risk of heart disease, even in people without known risk factors," Yon &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/shingles-vaccine-lowers-the-risk-of-heart-disease-for-up-to-eight-years"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be big news if confirmed, but makes sense given what we know about shingles' short-term effects on the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A shingles infection can cause blood vessel damage, inflammation, and clot formation that can lead to heart disease," Yon &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/shingles-vaccine-lowers-the-risk-of-heart-disease-for-up-to-eight-years"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. "By preventing shingles, vaccination may lower these risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150628" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150628" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/DiagramOfHowArteriesGetBlockedInHeartDisease.jpg" alt="Diagram showing plaque formation in diseased arteries" class="size-full wp-image-150628" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/DiagramOfHowArteriesGetBlockedInHeartDisease.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/DiagramOfHowArteriesGetBlockedInHeartDisease-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150628" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Plaque buildup narrows the arteries – blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body – which lessens or blocks the flow of blood. (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the largest and most comprehensive of its kind, the study has some limitations, the authors acknowledge. The sample lacks diversity, since all subjects are from South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While we conducted rigorous analysis, this study does not establish a direct causal relationship, so potential bias from other underlying factors should be considered," Yon &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/shingles-vaccine-lowers-the-risk-of-heart-disease-for-up-to-eight-years"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study only addresses the live zoster vaccine, which uses a weakened form of the virus. There's also a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html"&gt;recombinant subunit vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for shingles, featuring just a viral protein, that's increasingly prevalent in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, previous research suggests both shingles vaccines may also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-shingles-vaccine-does-even-better-job-of-delaying-onset-of-dementia"&gt;protect against dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf230"&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419689122"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Multiple sclerosis and gut microbiota: Lachnospiraceae from the ileum of MS twins trigger MS-like disease in germfree transgenic mice—An unbiased functional study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billions of bacteria and other microscopic organisms make their home in the human digestive tract. Collectively known as the gut microbiome, these microbes play important roles in human health and disease that are only beginning to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies have suggested that the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/08/13/ms-gut-microbiome-pattern-similar-us-asia-analysis/"&gt;gut microbiome is altered in MS&lt;/a&gt;. But scientists have struggled to pinpoint specific bacteria that are associated with MS. Individual studies often find different or contradictory results. Part of the issue is that the makeup of the gut microbiome is influenced by many factors, including genetics and lifestyle, which makes it hard to zero in on changes that are related to MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, researchers analyzed the makeup of the gut microbiome in 81 pairs of monozygotic (identical) twins where one twin had MS and the other did not. Since identical twins share the same genetic code and siblings generally have similar lifestyle exposures, this approach aimed to cut down on variability due to factors other than MS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Examining bacteria&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results revealed 51 different types of bacteria whose abundance was significantly altered in the twins with MS, relative to twins without MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to explore the functional relevance of bacteria in the guts of twins with or without MS. To do this, they used a germ-free mouse model, meaning mice that are engineered so that they completely lack their own gut microbiome. In the model that the researchers used, the mice are prone to developing MS-like neurological disease when bacteria are added to their guts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers took gut bacteria from the twins and transplanted them into the digestive tracts of these mice. For these experiments, the researchers used bacteria from two sets of twins, one female and one male. The female MS patient had fairly severe disease, whereas the male patient had relatively mild disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these differences between the two pairs, mice transplanted with bacteria from the twins with MS were significantly more likely to develop MS-like disease than mice given bacteria from the twins who didn’t have MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female mice were also more susceptible to developing MS than male mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that mice that developed MS tended to have high levels of bacteria belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family. This was consistent across both pairs of twins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Taken together, our results show an association of members of the Lachnospiraceae family derived from [gut] material with [MS-like disease] development across two independent and highly [varied] MS twin pairs,” the researchers wrote. The data indicate “that these bacteria might play a crucial role as environmental triggering factors of human MS,” the scientists added, though they stressed that additional research will be needed to test this idea in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;

Over 7.6 million people in the UK are living with heart or circulatory diseases, according to the British Heart Foundation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's also estimated that one in 12 people worldwide are affected by the disease. &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Heart disease&lt;/a&gt; encompasses a variety of &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;conditions&lt;/a&gt; that impact the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's often triggered by fatty deposits in the arteries, which can increase the risk of blood clots. This can also result in damage to the brain, heart, kidneys, and eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; However, symptoms of heart disease can vary from person to person, and some individuals may not recognise the warning signs, reports &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/heart-disease-symptom-legs-46-31034874" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;. A recent survey conducted by &lt;a href="https://onlinedoctor.lloydspharmacy.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor&lt;/a&gt; involving 500 UK adults revealed that only 46 per cent were aware that leg swelling could be a symptom of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In light of February being National Heart Month, Dr Bhavini Shah, a GP at LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor, elaborated on these symptoms and provided practical advice on how to lower your risk. Symptoms of heart disease can include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Extreme fatigue&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Irregular heartbeat&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Swelling of the legs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31623702" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chest pain is a common symptom of heart disease. If you experience chest pain that feels like pressure, tightness, squeezing, or heaviness, it could indicate a heart attack, and it's crucial to call 999 immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the survey, 80 per cent of participants identified chest pain as a symptom, making it the most recognised overall. In addition, 77 per cent of people correctly identified shortness of breath as a symptom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Shah explains that if the heart isn't pumping enough blood throughout the body, fluid may build up in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe and leading to shortness of breath. Irregular heart rhythms can also be an indication of heart disease, which 70 per cent of people were aware of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While this might not be directly linked to a serious condition, it's important to get this checked to understand any underlying issues. Some 66 per cent of surveyed respondents acknowledged that extreme fatigue can also be a symptom, making day-to-day activities or mild exercise exhausting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Shah also says that leg swelling, medically known as oedema, is a less well-known symptom of heart disease and occurs when fluid builds up in the tissue.

The &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; suggests a diet rich in fibre and low in fat, incorporating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables daily, along with whole grains such as oats, rye and brown rice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also advised keeping salt intake below six grams per day and avoiding saturated fats which can hike up cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Staying Active&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Shah advocates for regular physical activity as a preventative measure against heart disease. The British Heart Foundation states that maintaining an active lifestyle can decrease the risk of heart disease by up to 35 per cent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regular exercise also aids in blood pressure regulation and cholesterol reduction. A minimum of 150 minutes of exercise per week is recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether it's a brisk walk, cycling, swimming or attending a fitness class, finding an enjoyable activity could help maintain consistency and promote a healthier lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31623825" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

According to NHS guidelines, both men and women should limit their intake to no more than 14 units of alcohol per week, spread over at least three days rather than consumed all at once.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overindulging in alcohol has been linked to high blood pressure. Consistently exceeding the recommended 14 units a week over a decade can heighten your risk of developing heart disease or suffering a stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get Quality Sleep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ensuring you get a good night's sleep is vital. Insufficient sleep may increase your risk of heart disease. A healthy adult requires between seven and nine hours of sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teenagers, children and babies will need more, ranging from eight to 16 hours. Implementing small yet manageable changes to your daily routine can significantly improve your heart health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have any of these symptoms and are concerned you may be at risk of a heart attack, it's essential to dial 999.

Over 7.6 million people in the UK are living with heart or circulatory diseases, according to the British Heart Foundation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's also estimated that one in 12 people worldwide are affected by the disease. &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Heart disease&lt;/a&gt; encompasses a variety of &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;conditions&lt;/a&gt; that impact the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's often triggered by fatty deposits in the arteries, which can increase the risk of blood clots. This can also result in damage to the brain, heart, kidneys, and eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; However, symptoms of heart disease can vary from person to person, and some individuals may not recognise the warning signs, reports &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/heart-disease-symptom-legs-46-31034874" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;. A recent survey conducted by &lt;a href="https://onlinedoctor.lloydspharmacy.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor&lt;/a&gt; involving 500 UK adults revealed that only 46 per cent were aware that leg swelling could be a symptom of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In light of February being National Heart Month, Dr Bhavini Shah, a GP at LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor, elaborated on these symptoms and provided practical advice on how to lower your risk. Symptoms of heart disease can include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Extreme fatigue&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Irregular heartbeat&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Swelling of the legs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31623702" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chest pain is a common symptom of heart disease. If you experience chest pain that feels like pressure, tightness, squeezing, or heaviness, it could indicate a heart attack, and it's crucial to call 999 immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the survey, 80 per cent of participants identified chest pain as a symptom, making it the most recognised overall. In addition, 77 per cent of people correctly identified shortness of breath as a symptom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Shah explains that if the heart isn't pumping enough blood throughout the body, fluid may build up in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe and leading to shortness of breath. Irregular heart rhythms can also be an indication of heart disease, which 70 per cent of people were aware of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While this might not be directly linked to a serious condition, it's important to get this checked to understand any underlying issues. Some 66 per cent of surveyed respondents acknowledged that extreme fatigue can also be a symptom, making day-to-day activities or mild exercise exhausting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Shah also says that leg swelling, medically known as oedema, is a less well-known symptom of heart disease and occurs when fluid builds up in the tissue. This can worsen throughout the day. Less than half (46 per cent) were aware of this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31623814" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

Many participants described coping strategies like keeping spreadsheets or using voices and clothing to identify others, but these are often exhausting and unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition frequently leads to social anxiety, isolation, and fear of being perceived as rude or unintelligent. Researchers call for greater public awareness, workplace accommodations, and recognition of face blindness as a form of neurodivergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Yet Overlooked:&lt;/strong&gt; About 1 in 50 people have developmental prosopagnosia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Struggles:&lt;/strong&gt; Even “mild” cases can cause social anxiety and impair relationships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodivergence Recognition:&lt;/strong&gt; Experts urge classifying face blindness as neurodivergence for better inclusion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever been ignored by someone you knew when you bumped into them in the street or at an event? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, you probably thought they were being rude. But they might have face blindness – a condition officially known as developmental prosopagnosia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study my colleagues and I conducted, 29 adults with face blindness revealed the daily challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten of the participants said they could not reliably recognise immediate family members, and 12 couldn’t recognise closest friends in out-of-context or unexpected encounters. Yet many felt it was socially difficult to admit these struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the participants didn’t recognise her husband of 30 years when he unexpectedly came to pick her up from the airport. Another described how “when I am off work for a week and come back it’s really hard to figure out who is who”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although public awareness of face blindness is low, there is a high chance that you already know someone with face recognition difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02643290903343149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one in 50 people&lt;/a&gt; have developmental prosopagnosia, a lifelong condition that causes severe face recognition difficulties despite otherwise normal vision, IQ and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers usually describe not being able to recognise close friends and family as a “severe” form of prosopagnosia, but our new study – conducted with a colleague at Dartmouth College in the US – shows that even people classified as having “mild” prosopagnosia can have serious difficulties in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that prosopagnosia diagnosis should consider real-life experiences, not just lab tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most face-blind participants who took part in the research had tried various strategies to recognise people. However, these methods required huge mental effort and often didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, keeping detailed notes, or even spreadsheets, with descriptions and cues about people they have met. Or mentally trying to associate a name with a personally distinctive feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, participants admitted their strategies were often “exhausting” and were particularly difficult to use at work when they were busy, concentrating on a task, or because colleagues wore uniforms or similar work clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some prosopagnosics said they used unusual ways to recognise others, for example, by smell. Another said that worrying about a face distracted them, so they found it more helpful to look at people from behind to work out who they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosopagnosics told researchers how their condition caused them considerable difficulties at school, at work and in everyday social situations. Two-thirds of the prosopagnosics said they could recognise fewer than ten familiar faces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30305434/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; suggests most adults recognise around 5,000 faces, so this difference is huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A widespread worry among people with face blindness was being misjudged as rude, uncaring, or even “a bit dim” by others who didn’t understand the condition. This concern often led to social anxiety and reduced self-confidence in social situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common coping strategy was to avoid social gatherings or to deliberately keep social circles small to limit the number of faces people had to try and learn. But these strategies sometimes had a downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back on their lives, some people felt that their face recognition difficulties had left them socially isolated, or with “poorly developed” social skills because they hadn’t mixed much with others while growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosopagnosics were asked what they thought future research into face blindness should focus on. Their top priority was improved awareness and understanding that this condition exists and how it affects people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They thought this was particularly important for employers, schools and medical staff – but also for the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that many simple things could make life much easier for people with face recognition difficulties. Providing large name badges at events and conferences is a simple but helpful adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants said they found it a huge relief when meetings started with a round of introductions, the chair always addressed people by name, or they were given seating plans. Hot desking causes problems, so keeping a regular seating plan in a workplace or classroom can help face-blind people learn who usually sits where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are meeting a face-blind friend, sending a quick message beforehand to let them know what you are wearing and exactly where you are sitting can also help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A form of neurodivergence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I believe that developmental prosopagnosia should be considered a type of neurodivergence. This term describes someone whose brain works differently from what is considered typical. It usually includes people with autism, ADHD, dyslexia and dyspraxia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising face blindness as a form of neurodivergence isn’t just about awareness, it’s about dignity, inclusion and making everyday life easier for thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this prosopagnosia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/judith-lowes-2355221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Judith Lowes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Judith Lowes – The Conversation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0322469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;This condition impacts every aspect of my life: A survey to understand the experience of living with developmental prosopagnosia&lt;/a&gt;” by Judith Lowes et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This condition impacts every aspect of my life: A survey to understand the experience of living with developmental prosopagnosia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mixed methods study examined the real-world experiences of living with developmental prosopagnosia (face blindness), a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that severely affects the ability to recognise faces despite otherwise normal vision, IQ and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine UK based adults with confirmed face recognition difficulties completed an online survey describing and quantifying their experiences of living with poor face recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the majority (62%) of participants reported being able to recognise their immediate family, e.g., parent, partner, or child, strikingly 35% reported being unable to reliably recognise their immediate family members &lt;em&gt;out of context&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even fewer (45%), reported always being able to recognise their three closest friends when encountering them unexpectedly, highlighting that DP commonly affects the recognition of highly familiar faces with whom individuals have close emotional relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, participants who reported being able or unable to recognise their immediate family showed no significant difference in objective face memory ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two thirds of participants (65.5%) reported being able to recognise fewer than 10 familiar faces (with the most common response being none), far below typical abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thematic framework analysis highlighted how low public, professional, and employer awareness of developmental prosopagnosia presented challenges across multiple domains including seeking diagnosis, social and family relationships and workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driven largely by concerns about negative evaluation by others, most participants employed a range of highly effortful, though error prone, strategies to disguise and compensate for their face recognition difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the strategies described may help explain why many individuals can perform within typical norms on laboratory face processing tests despite their clear difficulties in everyday life and highlight the need for ecologically valid tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ highest priorities for future research were improved awareness of developmental prosopagnosia and interventions to improve their face recognition ability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254644/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 12:36:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9JTUpjM01mZ3lMXzVsbTB3X1NNeUpUcVpraG42YjhmbGlmTk5sY0xZVzY5UjRxcmxGanZLRUotNnVnZ2NZM1dwZWpVVnVIMEhPdlV1TnFxZE5JSUREd1VuV1RDYmdqR1kyZ1BwVjV4bVlJdw</guid></item><item><title>胃肠道癌：吃鸡肉会缩短寿命吗？ -今日医学新闻 | Gastrointestinal cancer: Can eating chicken shorten lifespan?

Image credit: Maryanne Gobble/Stocksy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study found that eating 300 grams of poultry per week was linked to an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer and death from all causes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;The findings have caused concern among consumers as they challenge traditional beliefs that poultry such as chicken and turkey is a healthier choice of protein.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; speaks to experts to investigate whether these findings lack nuance or whether there is a genuine need for more caution regarding diets and cancer risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study conducted in southern Italy presented some surprising findings that linked the regular consumption of poultry to potential increases in gastrointestinal cancers and all-cause mortality. This has caused one question to arise — is eating chicken really as healthy as we think it is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study’s findings indicated that exceeding the weekly recommended amounts — that is, eating more than 300 grams (g) of poultry, such as chicken and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/285736/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt;, per week — resulted in a 27% higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to eating moderate amounts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the research suggested that higher poultry intake was linked to a 2.3% increase in the risk of gastrointestinal cancers, with a higher observed risk among men at 2.6%. The findings were published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/8/1370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has concerned consumers is that these findings contrast with current established dietary guidelines, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324221" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, of which poultry is an important component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, should such results make people reconsider their diets? Could the results be overestimated? What should consumers watch out for when interpreting the results of similar studies on nutrition? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; spoke to two experts — &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/wael-harb?__cf_chl_tk=m.yLQsTqKKXm9mowC3g_mO5jY902.CI1wcKSRPtBHb0-1746795664-1.0.1.1-yupgdWPQS7rq0WH2djh1CwDgKfVoYld4AN._tzLy4bo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Wael Harb&lt;/a&gt;, MD, board certified hematologist and medical oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA, and &lt;a href="https://www.kristinkirkpatrick.com/meet-kristin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Kristin Kirkpatrick&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic Dept of Department of Wellness &amp;amp; Preventive Medicine in Cleveland, OH, and senior fellow at the Meadows Behavioral Healthcare in Wickenburg, AZ, to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both experts reiterated that an association from an observational study is not enough to draw definitive conclusions about a dietary item and its links to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings are interesting, but as this is an observational study, it doesn’t prove causation. The broader body of evidence still supports moderate poultry consumption as part of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153998/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;a balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;,” Harb told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harb underscored that poultry played an important role in healthy diets and advised caution when interpreting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study raises important questions, but we need to interpret it with caution. Poultry has long been a core part of healthy eating patterns like the Mediterranean diet, which is associated with reduced cancer and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/heart-disease-ct-scans-may-be-best-for-predicting-risk-during-middle-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart disease risks&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br&gt;— Wael Harb, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important point to consider is that cancer, as a disease, is very complex and multifactorial, meaning it is hard to pinpoint its causes to one factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies show that the development of cancer from one person to another is complex and encompasses multiple factors, including but not limited to genetics, environment, diet, physical activity, exposure to toxins, and even age and inflammation. Therefore, we need to look at any study and try to assess how it can be translated to our lifestyle,” said Kirkpatrick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you smoke, for example, the first step before cutting chicken out may be quitting smoking. This is just one example of how we can assess data,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How food items are cooked or whether other additives such as oils and spices are added can change the ‘healthiness’ of a food source. The two experts said the potential cancer risks associated with eating poultry could be more closely connected to those aspects, rather than the poultry itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“When poultry is grilled, fried, or cooked at high temperatures, it can form compounds like heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have been linked to cancer risk. However, these compounds also occur in red meat and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318630/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;processed meats&lt;/a&gt;, so the issue may lie more in cooking methods than the type of meat itself,” Harb explained, highlighting that how a good is cooked could result in the release of cancer-causing chemicals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirkpatrick further explained how a food item is processed and cooked can impact the potential benefits or risks of consuming it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, a frozen chicken nugget may be considered ultra-processed, and breaded and fried chicken &lt;hl-trusted-source source="BMJ" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.k5420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;may pose risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; from the process of high-heat frying as well. Both may differ in their impact on health when compared to a plain &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326767/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;chicken breast&lt;/a&gt; that is baked,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;White vs. red meat: Which is healthier?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has also fed into a long-standing debate about whether white meat is healthier than red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In fact, a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522011492?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found that white and red meat may both have similar effects on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315900/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;blood cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, specifically LDL or “bad” cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apoB).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study also fails to identify the specific type of poultry consumed and its links to heightened cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study was not able to identify the specific type of poultry (for example, was the consumed protein processed deli meat or was it a grilled chicken breast). The processing of meats in general may change their health risks. We would need more studies assessing various types of poultry and various types of red meat to truly assess significant differences between the two,” Kirkpatrick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did have several limitations, such as not accounting for the sources of the poultry consumed, the potential impacts of pesticides on plant and animal crops, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/10278/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;antibiotic&lt;/a&gt; and hormone usage in industrially raised poultry, as well as cooking methods, meat preparation, and dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Limitations the authors cited was lacking information on specifics of the poultry consumed/ cooking methods, as well as lack of data on physical activity — which shows positive impact to mortality from other studies,” Kirkpatrick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harb said that the type of follow-up research needed would have to address multiple unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need well-designed prospective studies that account for cooking methods, levels of processing, and overall dietary habits. It would also help to examine biological markers of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-is-a-carcinogen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;carcinogen&lt;/a&gt; exposure in people with high poultry intake. Given that the risk was higher in men, gender-specific research would be important too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirkpatrick said that these results are not enough to change current recommendations for healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study would not cause me to stop recommending poultry to my patients, especially in those patients that are making other beneficial lifestyle changes alongside poultry consumption — such as a dietary pattern high in fruits, vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/fiber-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323255/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322295/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, and other forms of protein such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt; and lentils, or wild fatty fish,” she told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding what is considered healthy and safe by the United States, Harb reminded that current guidelines recommend no more than 300 g per week as a limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on what we know, the current guideline of 300 grams of poultry per week is reasonable — especially if the poultry is skinless, minimally processed, and not cooked at high temperatures.”&lt;br&gt;— Wael Harb, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for those with certain health conditions or a family history of cancer, a lower intake may be more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For those who are particularly health-conscious or have a family history of cancer, staying closer to 200 grams per week and incorporating more fish, legumes, and plant proteins may be a prudent option,” Harb said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News

&lt;p&gt;We've seen reports of infections in cats, but new research from the University of Maryland in the US suggests feline cases – and the risk of transmission from cats to humans – is not being taken seriously enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Bird flu is very deadly to cats, and we urgently need to figure out how widespread the virus is in cat populations to better assess spillover risk to humans," airborne infectious disease researcher Kristen Coleman &lt;a href="https://sph.umd.edu/news/bird-flu-study-points-risk-another-pandemic"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly crucial as birds in the United States make their springtime migrations, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/unprecedented-spread-of-bird-flu-exacerbated-by-climate-crisis-experts-warn"&gt;potentially spreading the virus further afield&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As summer approaches, we are anticipating cases on farms and in the wild to rise again," Coleman &lt;a href="https://sph.umd.edu/news/bird-flu-study-points-risk-another-pandemic"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149636" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149636" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/hpai-mammals-map.jpg" alt="map of the united states showing locations where detections of HPAI in wild and captive mammals have been confirmed" class="wp-image-149636 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/hpai-mammals-map.jpg 1920w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/hpai-mammals-map-642x390.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/hpai-mammals-map-683x415.jpg 683w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/hpai-mammals-map-768x466.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/hpai-mammals-map-1536x933.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/hpai-mammals-map-600x364.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149636" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Detections of H5N1 in wild and captive mammals in the US, May 2022 to January 2025. (USDA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coleman and her co-author, animal scientist Ian Bemis, analyzed peer-reviewed research published between 2004 and 2024, finding 607 reported cases of bird flu infection in cats globally. Across 18 countries and 12 species (ranging from house cats to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cdc-detects-bird-flu-mutation-in-human-amid-new-infections-in-cats"&gt;zoo tigers&lt;/a&gt;), 302 deaths were associated with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that a lack of monitoring means these numbers are a serious underestimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They noticed that in 2023, reports of pet cat infections increased drastically. In 2023 and 2024, there was a spike in the number of pet cats infected with, and killed by, bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most cases can be attributed to the deadliest strain of bird flu, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, which had a 90 percent case fatality rate within the data. However, this rate may not reflect the actual risk of death to cats if infected, since testing has been very limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors urge authorities, veterinarians, and pet owners to increase surveillance of cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want to help protect both people and pets," Coleman &lt;a href="https://sph.umd.edu/news/bird-flu-study-points-risk-another-pandemic"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no confirmed cases of cat-to-human transmission for this particular strain of bird flu, although &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-york-officials-report-the-first-ever-case-of-bird-flu-spread-from-cat-to-human"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the outbreak of a different strain among cats in New York City animal shelters did result in cat-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human-to-human transmission is yet to be recorded, but &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00245-6"&gt;researchers are concerned&lt;/a&gt; this ability &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-mutation-could-bring-bird-flu-a-critical-step-closer-to-a-new-pandemic"&gt;may only be a few genetic mutations away&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcZo8PaPpns?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Coleman and Bemis note that owners of farm cats, free-roaming cats, veterinarians, zookeepers, and animal shelter volunteers may have a higher risk of exposure to bird flu through interspecies transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunting is in a cat's nature. A free-range cat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/outdoor-cats-kill-110-native-animals-a-year-in-australia"&gt;can kill around 186 animals each year&lt;/a&gt;. Besides &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-an-indiscriminate-killer-stalking-your-yard-study-confirms"&gt;protecting wildlife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/15-ways-to-keep-your-cat-happy-inside-because-allowing-them-outside-isn-t-safe"&gt;saving on vet bills&lt;/a&gt;, this might be another good reason to transition your beloved companion to an indoor lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cats become infected by hunting and eating infected wild birds and mammals, or by consuming &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bird-flu-confirmed-in-cat-deaths-linked-to-raw-pet-food-milk"&gt;infected raw pet food or raw cow's milk&lt;/a&gt; – including products sold commercially. They can also catch the virus from other mammals they live alongside, including cats in the neighborhood and, potentially, their owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our future research will involve studies to determine the prevalence of high pathogenicity avian influenza and other influenza  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="160656" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; in high-risk cat populations such as dairy barn cats," Bemis &lt;a href="https://sph.umd.edu/news/bird-flu-study-points-risk-another-pandemic"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaf261"&gt;Open Forum Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Not only that, but it may be attracting mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With their durable roots, bamboo plants have hollow stalks that easily collect and hold water, which the disease-spreading pests love. These small crevices are the ideal vessel for them to lay their eggs. But that's not all. You may think pesticides would do the trick of getting rid of these biters, but because of how small and deep some of these shoots are, mosquitos can be shielded from the spray and live on. To make matters worse, harsh chemicals from pesticide solutions can end up harming your other plants around the bamboo. However, you can still enjoy privacy on your property without pesky mosquitoes flying around by planting other plants, such as Chinese snowball bush (Viburnum macrocephalum) in your yard instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/herb-consider-growing-garden-healthy-090000947.html" data-ylk="slk:The Herb You Should Consider Growing In Your Garden For Healthy Soil;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;The Herb You Should Consider Growing In Your Garden For Healthy Soil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Chinese Snowball Bush Is The Better Alternative For Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blooming Chinese snowball bush with white flowers in front of brick wall - Photos By R A Kearton/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While Chinese snowball bush is a great alternative for privacy that doesn't attract mosquitoes, there are also many other major benefits, like its eye-catching look, ability to attract pollinators, and pest- and disease-resistant capabilities. Over multiple seasons, expect beautiful displays from your Chinese snowball bush. As a &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1376885/garden-hydrangea-vs-snowball-viburnum-pro-cons/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plant that's commonly mistaken for a hydrangea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;plant that's commonly mistaken for a hydrangea&lt;/a&gt;, it has similar-looking round groups of white or pink flower petals that add a decorative flair to your home in spring. In the fall, it has a visually appealing look with its deep autumn colors of red to burgundy foliage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thanks to its beautiful flowers, expect pollinators like butterflies to hang around your Chinese snowball bush — instead of pesky mosquitoes. Luckily, you don't have to worry about your beautiful privacy screen being prone to many plant problems since it is disease-resistant. However, it is ultimately a plant, so it can still get powdery mildew and leaf spots. Ensure proper watering and spacing when planting this flower bush. These white flower-blooming plants are great if you're looking to not only keep people from looking in through your windows but also deter pests. Chinese snowball bush is also not super attractive to deer or rabbits, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To add extra protection against prying eyes and mosquitoes, bee balm (Monarda spp.) is the perfect companion plant under snowball bushes. It has a visually appealing look with its vibrant red, pink, or purple flowers, which easily pair with the white petals on the snowball bushes. Together, the layered plants can offer privacy without the mosquito-attracting qualities of bamboo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Enjoyed this article?

This organ, which weighs about 3 pounds, performs over 500 functions, including the digestion of proteins, mineral storage, bile production, and blood filtration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/liver-health" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Liver health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is vital for overall well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/dr-joseph-salhab" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Dr. Joseph Salhab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a gastroenterologist with over 1.3 million followers on Instagram, has shared a list of snacks he munches on to maintain a healthy liver. Known online as Dr. GI Joe, he specializes in digestion, liver, pancreas, and nutrition. His snack recommendations combine some interesting foods, and you might absolutely enjoy them! Who knew eating yummy food could boost your liver health! Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. GI Joe likes to munch on watermelons, but with an interesting twist. He squeezes a lemon on to it, for a refreshing, liver-supporting snack. Watermelon is rich in citrulline, an amino acid that supports healthy blood flow. Both fruits provide antioxidants and vitamin C, and these compounds help the liver to combat oxidative stress, a key factor in liver damage, and promote efficient detoxification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine eating an &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/why-avocado-is-considered-the-ultimate-brain-food-5-reasons-to-consume-it-daily/photostory/121051528.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; toast to keep your liver healthy! Instead of regular bread, use sourdough. This combination leverages gut-friendly fermentation and healthy fats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/is-sourdough-better-than-the-everyday-bread-here-are-the-health-benefits-of-the-traditional-loaf/articleshow/119295640.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Sourdough’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; fermented properties support gut health, which is closely linked to liver function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocado’s monounsaturated fats aid the liver in processing sugars and storing fat effectively, and reduce the risk of fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next on Dr. Salhab’s list is kimchi paired with sweet potato. If you enjoy kimchi, you have really won the jackpot. Kimchi, a fermented dish, delivers probiotics that enhance gut health, while sweet potato’s resistant starch nourishes beneficial gut bacteria. Together, they reduce the risk of fat accumulation in the liver, a precursor to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of walnuts and almonds is a go-to snack for the gut doctor. These nuts are packed with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E, both of which have been shown to decrease liver fat and shield liver cells from oxidative damage. This nutrient-dense snack supports long-term liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to the basics - berries and dark chocolate. If you fancy some sweet treat, combine dark chocolate with berries. Both are rich in flavonoids, powerful antioxidants that protect the liver from scarring and maintain healthy blood vessels. This pairing offers a delicious way to reduce inflammation and support liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwi and Greek yogurt are a power couple. The nutrient-packed duo is great for liver health. Kiwi contains vitamin C and potassium, both essential for liver metabolism, while Greek yogurt’s probiotics support gut health. This combination enhances the liver’s energy production and detoxification processes, keeping it functioning optimally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Pregnant Kiara's Bold Met Debut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprinkle some cinnamon on the apple slices to indulge in a lip-smacking and healthy snack. Apples are high in fiber and antioxidants, which studies show can reduce liver fat buildup. Cinnamon has anti-inflammatory compounds that protect the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 11:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1gFBVV95cUxQWnYwMmdqc0N2Zjh6WWdNQXltZDROaUo0eUtsVld1QzlEbmNNdlVLZnF3aXlCTzBBU0ZBdjRfaTU5VkFOcUFjYzlzemd3SklOUExkMV9Fc3V6cWEtUVRzZ2xjNDQ2cUVJR3ZzeUpKamNtRXZlN2JQWGpDRHprTWtPZGhsMjd5VnZJQ1p4bzl1akwtVk96WWVjMnc1TnJIMjZqbmZMOTlpaW5wWmpVdG5IekpDY3RTYnI1RFhMWElYa081N201UXVWZ1ljcV9UYU0xY24tN2JR</guid></item><item><title>这个古老的杀手正在迅速对抗生素产生抗药性，使其比以往任何时候都更加致命-银河日报 | This Ancient Killer Is Rapidly Becoming Resistant to Antibiotics, Making It Deadlier Than Ever Before - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxNajFFSkF0dVprY1FSaEhfdVc4bkZVd3E4VHAwcFFKeThOSDVLLWZyWUhaUDZHeW9MMHE4LXpURjN6QUd0ZjhaQkhkQnV3OHg0R3dYdkY3NkhNV1psMTFub29idTZrR3RwWDRwTlNFYzRsZVItdEJTaHdtZ195RlBvUk0zUFRaeFVqQzNCaWc4OGVsam04WkhTemRPYTVwMjkyd1JNeDFzdUNTV3VMQnRTUUJwNjQ1bDg3NmlLcUROYVJWX1N5NVZiLU1WM2VPZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typhoid fever&lt;/strong&gt;, a disease once largely under control, is rapidly evolving into a dangerous global health threat. The bacterium responsible for this illness, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi&lt;/em&gt; (S Typhi)&lt;/strong&gt;, is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Although it is rare in developed countries, typhoid remains a persistent problem in developing regions, especially South Asia. According to a study published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Microbe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this ancient pathogen is evolving resistance to antibiotics, making it harder to treat and posing a growing risk worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rising Drug Resistance in South Asia&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the past three decades, the resistance of &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; to antibiotics has been growing and spreading. The study, which sequenced the genomes of 3,489 &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; strains collected between 2014 and 2019 in &lt;strong&gt;Nepal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;India&lt;/strong&gt;, found a concerning rise in &lt;strong&gt;extensively drug-resistant (XDR)&lt;/strong&gt; typhoid strains. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research indicates that &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; is not only resistant to &lt;strong&gt;frontline antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;ampicillin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;chloramphenicol&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole&lt;/strong&gt;, but also to &lt;strong&gt;fluoroquinolones&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;third-generation cephalosporins&lt;/strong&gt;. These new strains, which are now widespread in South Asia, are evolving faster than previously anticipated, replacing less resistant strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In their report, researchers emphasized the alarming speed at which these resistant strains have spread. “The speed at which highly-resistant strains of &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; have emerged and spread in recent years is a real cause for concern,” said infectious disease specialist &lt;strong&gt;Jason Andrews&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Stanford University&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the study’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Growing Global Threat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the majority of XDR typhoid cases originate in South Asia, particularly in &lt;strong&gt;Nepal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;India&lt;/strong&gt;, these resistant strains have already started spreading across the globe. Since 1990, nearly 200 cases of international spread have been identified, with these strains showing up in &lt;strong&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/africa-is-breaking-apart-a-new-ocean-is-forming-at-breakneck-speed-faster-than-expected/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="78626" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;East and Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and even in more developed regions such as the &lt;strong&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;United States&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Canada&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This rapid spread underscores the global nature of the problem, signaling that no country is safe from the consequences of resistant typhoid. The international transmission of these superbugs highlights a serious public health issue. “The recent emergence of XDR and azithromycin-resistant &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; creates greater urgency for rapidly expanding prevention measures,” the authors of the study wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This global distribution of resistant strains suggests that without intervention, more countries could soon face outbreaks that may be difficult to control.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Shrinking Treatment Options&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the battle against typhoid fever becomes increasingly difficult, the number of effective treatments is steadily shrinking. Historically, &lt;strong&gt;azithromycin&lt;/strong&gt; was the last remaining oral antibiotic effective in treating typhoid fever. However, the study reveals that &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/physicist-claims-pandemic-virus-mutations-prove-were-living-in-a-simulated-universe/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="77040" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mutations&lt;/a&gt; conferring resistance to azithromycin are now spreading in parts of South Asia. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these mutations have not yet fully developed in XDR strains, the research warns that if these &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/mice-with-a-human-gene-mutation-start-talking-differently-and-it-might-be-why-we-speak/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79893" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mutations spread further&lt;/a&gt;, “threatening the efficacy of all oral antimicrobials for typhoid treatment,” it would leave healthcare systems with few viable options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The emergence of resistance to azithromycin has raised serious concerns, especially given that untreated typhoid fever can lead to fatal outcomes in up to 20% of cases. Currently, there are 11 million cases of typhoid annually, making this increasing resistance a critical issue for global health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vaccination as a Critical Measure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The urgency of expanding vaccination efforts has never been greater. In countries where antibiotic resistance is rampant, &lt;strong&gt;typhoid conjugate vaccines&lt;/strong&gt; could play a crucial role in controlling the spread of the disease. &lt;strong&gt;Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt; has already become a leader in this area, being the first nation to implement routine immunization for typhoid. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts argue that increasing access to these vaccines could significantly reduce the incidence of typhoid. A study in &lt;strong&gt;India&lt;/strong&gt; estimated that vaccinating children in urban areas could prevent up to &lt;strong&gt;36%&lt;/strong&gt; of typhoid cases and deaths, a potential lifesaver in regions most affected by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In their study, the authors stress the need to expand vaccination programs in countries where antimicrobial resistance is high, but also to ensure global access to these vaccines. “Such measures are needed in countries where antimicrobial resistance prevalence among &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; isolates is currently high, but given the propensity for international spread, should not be restricted to such settings,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to prevent typhoid, especially in light of the dwindling effectiveness of antibiotics. The researchers and health experts emphasize that swift and widespread vaccination efforts are essential to prevent future outbreaks and to curb the global spread of drug-resistant typhoid.&lt;/p&gt;

This is because, just like the flu, COVID-19 mutates quickly and vaccines need to be updated to ensure the season’s shot is targeting the right virus strain. This happens for both the flu shot and the COVID-19 shot, which is why new jabs are available roughly every September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in recent weeks, the future of the anticipated fall COVID-19 boosters has been questioned. There are rumors of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-placebos-covid.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a potential delay in distribution due to testing changes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf004e4b0a178bbffda1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-placebos-covid.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;a potential delay in distribution due to testing changes&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="many experts call unnecessary" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf004e4b0a178bbffda1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;many experts call unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;, and potential changes to the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fda-chief-downplays-covid-boosters_n_681bb14be4b0f8cbd16d40f4" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="recommendations regarding who actually" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf004e4b0a178bbffda1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="681bb14be4b0f8cbd16d40f4" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;recommendations regarding who actually&lt;/a&gt; needs the shots. This is all part of the Trump administration’s major changes to health care infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth knowing that COVID booster shot uptake in the U.S. has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="been very low" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf004e4b0a178bbffda1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;been very low&lt;/a&gt;, but the shots remain an important protection measure for everyone, especially for older adults and immunocompromised people who are more at risk of death or hospitalization from a COVID infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the future of COVID boosters is not clear right now&lt;em&gt; (so, don’t panic)&lt;/em&gt;, experts say a delay in vaccine availability or narrowing of eligibility could be dangerous. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s unclear if the new COVID shots will be delayed, but if they are, there will be more sickness and more death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, COVID shots are updated every season (just like flu shots), so they best protect against the virus strain that’s currently circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The plans were, as we did last year, to update the COVID vaccine to keep up with the changing COVID virus. This has been done very efficiently because we have enough information about the vaccines and how they work so that we don’t have to do a prospective clinical trial with the influenza vaccine, and we have not, at least in the past, had to do that with COVID vaccine,” said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. William Schaffner" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf004e4b0a178bbffda1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventive medicine in the department of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="now been suggested" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf004e4b0a178bbffda1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;now been suggested&lt;/a&gt; by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary that there isn’t enough data on COVID vaccines and that additional testing may be required before the shot is available. “To do that with the COVID vaccine, I think that notion would be disputed by most of the people in the vaccine community, including myself,” Schaffner noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is problematic because additional trials and testing take more time, so by the time the testing is done and analyzed, we could be way past the optimal time for COVID vaccination, which is the fall, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, a certain kind of testing that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="RFK Jr. is calling for" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf004e4b0a178bbffda1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;RFK Jr. is calling for&lt;/a&gt;, known as placebo testing, goes against medical ethical standards when it comes to the COVID booster (plus, the original COVID shot was already placebo tested).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It does not meet our ethical standards to enroll people into a trial and say, we’re going to give half of you nothing, withhold a vaccine from you, and the other people are going to get a vaccine when we already know the vaccine works, and we’ve got years worth of data to support that,” said &lt;a href="https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=jodie-guest-276" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jodie Guest" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf004e4b0a178bbffda1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=jodie-guest-276" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;Dr. Jodie Guest&lt;/a&gt;, the senior vice chair of the department of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So that violates our human subject research ethics, and ultimately, it will delay vaccine for everyone,” Guest noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, if the COVID vaccine were to be delayed or unavailable ... that would put a large segment of the population at risk of COVID,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly the case for people over 65 and those who are immunocompromised, added Guest. “It will mean more hospitalizations. It will certainly mean more sickness. And we know that people in those categories are more likely to need hospital support if they do get COVID and get sick,” said Guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deaths could increase, too. This past January when COVID levels were higher, there were nearly &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="1,000 deaths each week" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf004e4b0a178bbffda1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;1,000 deaths each week&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, added Guest. And currently, more than than 6,000 people have died of COVID in the U.S. in the past three months, said &lt;a href="https://www.epidemiologistkat.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Katrine Wallace" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf004e4b0a178bbffda1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.epidemiologistkat.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;Katrine Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Illinois Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are not at risk for those severe complications from COVID, but there are a lot of people who are, and we are all going to know and love people who are in those higher-risk categories. And we really need to be thinking about that,” Guest said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Catherine Delahaye via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Catherine Delahaye via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Wearing a mask remains an important way to keep yourself and others protected from COVID-19.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s unknown, but there could be changes to the COVID vaccine recommendations. Meaning, it may not be recommended to everyone 6 months and up anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s also unclear is who would be eligible for a new COVID shot this fall. Meaning, the recommendation guidelines could change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee that decides who’s eligible for the COVID vaccine (and any immunization, for that matter) is debating whether the COVID vaccine recommendations should stay as-is (everyone 6 months and older can get the jab) or if the recommendations should focus on high-risk people instead, Schaffner said. He noted that some other countries handle COVID vaccinations this way, and the committee is looking at that data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guest said that with less severe disease and complications from COVID, she’s not surprised that there is talk of changing vaccine recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we should restrict who is eligible for COVID vaccine boosters, but I do think we should be prioritizing who we want to make sure get them. And that’s a very common thing to do,” Guest said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, it’s unclear whether the vaccine recommendations will change at all, but if they do, Wallace said, she’s concerned about what that would mean for health insurance coverage for those who want the vaccine but aren’t eligible since health insurance doesn’t cover things you aren’t eligible for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, that would be a problem for some people who want it,” Wallace added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s also the issue of long COVID, right?” Wallace said. “We have post-COVID conditions that happen to young people. That’s not something that only happens to the elderly or people with pre-existing conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anybody can get long COVID, and it’s really hard to predict who’s going to get it,” Wallace said. One thing that does decrease the likelihood of long COVID is the COVID vaccine, which is concerning if recommendations are changed to exclude some folks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No matter what happens with the COVID booster shots, this back and forth is sowing distrust in the vaccine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current conversations from the leaders at Health and Human Services, the FDA and more are only sowing distrust in the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s making people question if they really need them or not. And we want to ask questions appropriately all the time in science, but we don’t want to intentionally sow distrust,” Guest said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to be really careful about how we’re eroding the way people think about it, and how important these vaccines have been, and how remarkable they have been in saving our lives,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of these conversations are going to discourage the uptake of vaccines ... the current conversations about questioning the need for the vaccines and changing the way they’re testing them, or what they might require, suggests that things were not done correctly originally, and that’s not accurate,” Guest added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And it’s going to sow further distrust in the vaccines, and that is going to be a very unfortunate outcome,” Guest said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would just reiterate that we have now given the available vaccines against COVID in the millions upon millions of doses around the world,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Put aside the notion that they are ‘new’ or ‘experimental’ — no, they’re not. They have been studied as carefully as any other vaccine that was ever used around the world,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

It’s also a good idea to test before gatherings, particularly if you’re going to be around high-risk folks, Wallace said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner added that if you are at high risk of severe disease or take care of someone who is, you can consider getting another COVID shot this spring or summer (before the new fall shots come out) for additional protection. If you’re considering getting another COVID shot, it’s best to talk to your doctor for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 11:00:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQd19LWUJvem40MzNlMHJMUmdMN0wtWUdmdFZ0cHFQbl9zcHJKcXBUUWROVlA5bktiT1NSTHVwQzBwV0VtMTNhV003TXZybjQ1R2NKaFF0b3Zqa0t2RGdEcG1JWlNPZG9aQ1RMcXR2Ukh2VlRzM2FVOGJJRkx2NW5mcmxReGNaVzhNM1HSAY8BQVVfeXFMUFpzTzllNTVoNHI3Ym9KWHBxTk9qWnJUNVY0VTN2Y3JPMDgyR29tbEIweEhOaDNVYzA4SjFVTG50cFNZYlBwT29MeTVDNTN1T0lLQ2g5dHNsdWc4cUtjWk9FanlOVzY0aEp4ZlhIRVZ1M0tJc3VFX0RaTXpNSDB2aVpyS2o1MWM0UlhWNnNRUFU</guid></item><item><title>营养师说，每天吃这1种食物，以始终实现你的纤维目标- TODAY.com | Eat This 1 Food Daily To Always Hit Your Fiber Goal, Dietitian Says - TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNY2FnN2F5VnNBV25fN0tfS2hTVzNteHVVdG8tN2RTNkxLdWpubHhha0dJRWFRMWdIMk5EYWZQSG5oUHZUTXRKQ182WWtHOGwzSTdIM2FEVVlITFAzdHptNXJhRTBRbnhvT3dMWGJwSXVNZng3aVpCeFJCMFRhcWdKSERtdkxuOGxJX21MWC1aZi3SAVRBVV95cUxNZFhMdXRxOFg4MzBnTkNZWVlTbWVxcDBZTTR4NUJBSzR0RTJSNWRLNENfVFY1YTBkcDVFdHExU2FfMGI5OGFSNER6V2JXS3ZUSVY2VjE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;You likely know fiber is one of the most important macronutrients, and you need to eat a fair amount of it every day to maintain a healthy gut, which feeds into many aspects of your wellbeing. Turning to fiber supplements may seem tempting, but it's almost always better to try to get important nutrients from whole foods first, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Plant-based dietitian and TODAY nutrition editor Natalie Rizzo used to struggle to meet her fiber goals. The recommended daily value is 28 grams for the average adult — the amount you'll find in about 2 cups of cooked lima beans. But then she started eating this one fruit every day and she's never missed it since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian tip of the day: Eat a pear to hit your daily fiber goal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Who doesn’t love a sweet and juicy pear? This delicious fruit is my secret weapon for meeting your fiber goals," Rizzo says. "Just one medium pear has 6 grams of fiber, which is about 20% of the amount you need each day. Plus, they are a good source of immune-boosting &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fruits-with-high-vitamin-c-rcna192810" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;. They are also 85% water, which helps you hit your hydration goals and plays a role in keeping you regular." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Fiber is the "street sweeper of your system," registered dietitian Grace Derocha &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-to-increase-fiber-intake-rcna123178" target="_blank"&gt;previously told TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There are two types of fiber: soluble, which moves food through your gut, and insoluble, which "actually (scrapes) the insides to get the gunk out of your system," she adds. Together, they remove waste from your body, which reduces inflammation and helps you absorb more nutrients from your food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Fiber can also help manage cholesterol, blood sugar levels and weight overall, and reduce constipation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To start eating more pears, Rizzo recommends taking one with you to work as a snack, adding a chopped pear to a salad or grain bowl for a little sweetness, or roasting one in the oven or air fryer to bring out the natural sugar of the fruit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.
