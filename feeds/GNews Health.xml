&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1k01t63/comment/mnaoaas/" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;: The conversations about vaccines rarely come up. I have tried to talk to them about it once in regard to my younger siblings. However, they are pretty resistant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the COVID-19 vaccine was rolling out, I tried to have a serious conversation with them about it, but it ended up in a big fight, which is not worth it to me. I think it's important to meet people where they're at and support them on their journey without being forceful because that can lead to more resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

The lawsuit said about four months later, Engel was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION, a condition in which a loss of blood flow to the optic nerve causes sudden and irreversible vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;NAION occurs in up to about 10 out of every 100,000 people over age 50, according &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/naion-diagnosis-and-management" target="_blank"&gt;to the American Academy of Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ozempic and others in the same class of drugs, called GLP-1s, were designed for Type 2 diabetes and have become wildly popular for weight loss in recent years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-may-linked-condition-causes-blindness-research-needed-rcna159991" target="_blank"&gt;Some studies have indicated&lt;/a&gt; that patients prescribed semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, for diabetes or weight loss may be at &lt;a href="https://increased%20risk%20of%20developin/" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk of developing NAION&lt;/a&gt;. Experts say while evidence is growing that there is an association between Ozempic and NAION, it’s still too early to know definitively if semaglutide raises the risk of developing the condition — especially because diabetes itself is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3786911/" target="_blank"&gt;a risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for NAION and &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticeyeproblems.html" target="_blank"&gt;other eye issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The lawsuit, filed late Thursday in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County, accuses Novo Nordisk of negligence and said it had a duty to provide patients and physicians with information about the risk of serious eye problems. It said Novo Nordisk had access to information dating back as early as its Ozempic clinical trials that identified cases of NAION yet chose not to list the condition on its warning label. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Nothing was or is stopping Defendant from adding a warning regarding the risk of NAION,” the lawsuit said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk said NAION is not an adverse drug reaction to Ozempic and other GLP-1s. Novo Nordisk said its benefit-risk profile of semaglutide “remains unchanged” after a thorough evaluation of studies from the University of Southern Denmark and an internal safety assessment, which didn’t suggest a causal relationship between GLP-1 use and NAION.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The company added that it takes reports of adverse events seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes. Any decision to start treatment with prescription-only medicines should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional who should do a benefit-risk evaluation for the patient in question, weighing up the benefits of treatment with the potential risks,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Jonathan Orent, an attorney for Engel who works for plaintiff litigation firm Motley Rice, said Engel first experienced loss of vision in one eye before eventually becoming legally blind in both. The eye problems forced him to resign from his job as a motor equipment operator for his county’s public works department, made it impossible for him to drive and have forever changed how he interacts with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg" alt="Todd Engel and his wife, Shelley."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Todd Engel and his wife, Shelley.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Todd Engel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He made a comment to me about how it’s painful to know he’s never going to see his wife smile again, but he knows her voice so well, he can tell when she is smiling,” Orent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He said if Engel had known Ozempic had a possible link to blindness, he would have considered other treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are a wide number of medications that can be used to treat diabetes, and treat it effectively,” Orent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The lawsuit is not the first of its kind. Another law firm recently filed a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/parker-waichman-llp-files-one-of-the-first-naion-eye-injury-cases-against-novo-nordisk-in-the-superior-court-of-new-jersey-middlesex-county-302429606.html" target="_blank"&gt;similar suit against Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The litigation comes amid ongoing questions over the link between the drug and NAION. A&lt;a href="https://%202024%20study/" target="_blank"&gt; 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found that people with diabetes who take semaglutide are over four times more likely to be diagnosed with NAION than people with diabetes who had not been prescribed it. Those who were overweight or obese and did not have diabetes were over seven times more likely to be diagnosed with NAION than those who had not been prescribed it, the study found. But the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-may-linked-condition-causes-blindness-research-needed-rcna159991" target="_blank"&gt;cautioned that more studies are needed&lt;/a&gt; to determine whether there is a causal link between the irreversible vision problems and the drugs, especially because it was a study based on an analysis of six years’ worth of medical records from patients in the Boston area, not a randomized clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In February, a JAMA Ophthalmology &lt;a href="https://study/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggested a more modest increase in the risk of NAION among people with Type 2 diabetes who take Ozempic, and also suggested further investigation was necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration declined to respond to questions about reports of a possible association between Ozempic and NAION, saying it does not comment on pending litigation. On the FDA’s Adverse Events Reporting System, a public dashboard, there are hundreds of reports from 2024 of eye disorders tied to Ozempic, though the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fdas-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers/fda-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers-public-dashboard" target="_blank"&gt;FDA warns the dashboard data&lt;/a&gt; may contain duplicates and the data has not been independently verified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Andrew Lee, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and a neuro-ophthalmologist at Houston Methodist Hospital, said he is eager for more research to come out on semaglutide, particularly on whether it raises the risk for life-altering eye diseases such as NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a super important question to be able to answer whether Ozempic or any semaglutide causes NAION,” he said. “There’s just so many people on this drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But patients who are concerned should not rush off the drug without speaking to their doctors, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“How many people would you harm if they weren’t on it because they got a stroke or a heart attack or got some other problem?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Engel’s lawsuit seeks damages and a jury trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Hopefully his story will show that there’s another side to this drug that has bought the reputation as being a miracle drug,” Orent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 00:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPTG1hd05HdElPM21xUkc1OXlHaGxNUXRFV3A0U2YteHY1LU9qVnFkOE1IbzFQWW0ydFBRSVFVUGY0and6TUh5c0E3M0FSSXR6LXlGX2JCbWplbTB0VWpzN0ZrOXAwYmxCRzNQVktUc05ER0JXR2RLb1AyMndZNDEwWElmdDNOd3FjaUQxRzZTbUE3VWJLb1E5eHE5OGc4RmlLakd3VFNJUQ</guid></item><item><title>大规模研究将15个因素与早期痴呆风险联系起来- ScienceAlert | Massive Study Links 15 Factors to Early Dementia Risk - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQWDBMTEVrWmdlMUtPT2lJZDJ2WTN0TjJTeG9zdkJEMnhTbFJtZnZtMlVLdVluYWstdUZ1WjNfSENheHo3OGctVTNSalFIN2JkRzBFbC1oaDAxcU9wTXI5eDNaN3hfcmZHNkFVWEVGc1RrRW93ZTd5UV9HWHRITmZiU3VrYVlkanVhWEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;While dementia is much more common in older adults, hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/young-onset-dementia"&gt;young-onset dementia&lt;/a&gt; (YOD) each year, and an extensive study published in 2023 sheds some considerable light on why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1533317514545825"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; in this area has looked at genetics passed down through generations, but here, the team was able to identify 15 different lifestyle and health factors that are associated with YOD risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the largest and most robust study of its kind ever conducted," &lt;a href="https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-health-and-life-sciences/risk-of-young-onset-dementia-could-be-reduced-through-targeting-health-and-lifestyle-factors/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist David Llewellyn from the University of Exeter in the UK, when the results were published in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Excitingly, for the first time it reveals that we may be able to take action to reduce risk of this debilitating condition, through targeting a range of different factors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data collected on 356,052 people aged under 65 in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149333" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149333" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/Flowchart-of-Included-Participants.jpg" alt="Flowchart " class="size-full wp-image-149333" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/Flowchart-of-Included-Participants.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/Flowchart-of-Included-Participants-600x347.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149333" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Flowchart of included participants.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="159293" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Vitamin&lt;/a&gt; D deficiency and high levels of the C-reactive protein (produced by the liver in response to inflammation) also meant a higher risk, as did having two of the ApoE4 ε4 gene variants (a genetic scenario already &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-genetic-form-of-alzheimers-identified-in-people-with-common-risk-factor"&gt;linked to Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers described the relationship between alcohol and YOD as "complex".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_146115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146115" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-642x429.jpg" alt="Different hands holding drinks" class="wp-image-146115 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-642x429.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-146115" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Ketut Subiyanto/Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-easy-strategy-to-reduce-alcohol-intake-scientists-say"&gt;alcohol abuse&lt;/a&gt; led to an increased risk, moderate to heavy drinking correlated with a reduced risk – possibly because people in this second group are usually healthier in general (bear in mind that those who abstain from alcohol often do so on medical grounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/education-seems-to-protect-the-gut-not-just-make-you-smarter"&gt;formal education&lt;/a&gt; and lower physical frailty (measured through higher handgrip strength) were also associated with a lower YOD risk. This all helps to fill in some of the knowledge gaps around YOD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We already knew from research on people who develop dementia at older age that there are a series of modifiable risk factors," &lt;a href="https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-health-and-life-sciences/risk-of-young-onset-dementia-could-be-reduced-through-targeting-health-and-lifestyle-factors/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; neuroepidemiologist Sebastian Köhler from Maastricht University in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition to physical factors, mental health also plays an important role, including avoiding chronic stress, loneliness, and depression."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the results don't prove dementia is caused by these factors, they help build a more detailed picture. As always in this kind of research, knowing more about the causes can help develop better treatments and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-popular-new-weight-loss-drug-may-help-prevent-dementia"&gt;preventative measures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these factors are modifiable, which offers more hope for those working to find ways to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bodybuilding-supplement-shown-to-stave-off-dementia-in-mice"&gt;beat dementia&lt;/a&gt; rather than just manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;Colorado on Friday reported its fifth incidence of measles this year, and, for the first time in the spate of cases, the infection was in a person who had been vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person, an adult living in Denver, had recently traveled to the Mexican state of Chihuahua, which is seeing an outbreak of measles. Two other cases identified in Colorado — one in a baby in Denver and another in a Pueblo resident — were also connected to travel to Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment identified one location where people may have been exposed to the virus as a result of this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was at the Kaiser Permanente urgent care clinic at 8383 W. Alameda Ave. in Lakewood between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Saturday, April 19, should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days and consider avoiding public gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you may be sick with measles, call ahead to your doctor’s office or emergency clinic before going in to allow the staff to make sure you can be seen without risk of exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-about-breakthrough-measles-infections"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About “breakthrough” measles infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new case is unusual because it is in someone who has verified proof of MMR vaccination. But that doesn’t mean such a so-called &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-breakthrough-cases-vaccination-important/story?id=120276354"&gt;breakthrough infection&lt;/a&gt; is unexpected, said Dr. Ned Calonge, CDPHE’s chief medical officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two doses of MMR vaccine are considered 97% effective at stopping an infection — one dose is considered 93% effective. That means on average three out of every 100 vaccinated people who are exposed to the virus will get sick.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When that happens, the illness is likely to be more mild, and that is exactly what occurred in the latest Colorado case, Calonge said. He said the infected person is reported to be feeling well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated people who develop an infection are also less infectious toward others, Calonge said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Calonge emphasized that this breakthrough infection does not mean the virus has mutated dangerously or become more adept at evading the immune system. Rather, he said, in rare cases people will not respond to the MMR vaccine or their immunity will wane over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faster-notification"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster notification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While state officials are optimistic about the health system’s readiness to respond to measles infections, some of the earlier cases &lt;a href="https://coloradosun.com/2025/04/24/denver-measles-case-public-health/"&gt;saw long delays&lt;/a&gt; in reporting suspected infections. That caused CDPHE to send out reminders to clinics and labs that possible measles cases need to be reported promptly to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, via Flickr)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latest case, it took nearly a week from the time the person visited the clinic to when the public was told about the confirmed case of measles. But Calonge said the clinic did inform CDPHE right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delay in publicly reporting the infection was because health officials looked at the vaccination status of the person and weren’t certain the test result to confirm a measles infection would come back positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The decision was, based on the vaccination history, that the likelihood was low,” Calonge said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Calonge said anyone who has been tested for measles should isolate themselves until the test result comes back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adult patient — Colorado’s fifth confirmed measles case this year — visited the Kaiser urgent care clinic at 8383 W. Alameda Ave. People who spent time in the clinic between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Saturday could have encountered the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other four cases in Colorado this year, the latest patient — who had visited an area of Chihuahua, Mexico — had received the measles vaccine, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. One dose of the vaccine is about 93% effective and two are 97% effective, meaning that some people can still get sick after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cases like this are very rare,” Dr. Ned Calonge, the state health department’s chief medical officer, said in a news release. “Staying up to date on vaccinations and being aware of health risks when traveling are important ways to protect yourself and your community. We’re sharing this information out of an abundance of caution to support early detection and limit the risk of further spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who get a breakthrough case are less likely to spread the virus than unvaccinated people, but anyone exposed to the virus should watch for symptoms, including a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, Calonge said. If an exposed person develops symptoms, they should call ahead before seeking medical care, so the clinic can keep them away from susceptible patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles patients can spread the virus for about four days before and four days after the characteristic rash develops. Symptoms can show up seven to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent case is the fourth in Colorado linked to travel to Mexico, where the virus is spreading after an outbreak in Texas spilled across the border. The other three patients were a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/31/colorado-measles-pueblo-outbreak-public-health-mmr-vaccine/"&gt;Pueblo County adult&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/08/denver-health-measles-emergency-room/"&gt;Denver infant&lt;/a&gt; and a person of unspecified age who &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/23/denver-measles-case-colorado/"&gt;lived in the same home as the baby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Archuleta County adult also developed measles. That person didn’t travel, and health officials &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/08/denver-health-measles-emergency-room/"&gt;aren’t sure where they got the virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, 29 states have reported a combined 884 measles cases this year, which is more than triple the total last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html?utm_source=Healthbeat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=af7cea22dd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_27_08_56&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-af7cea22dd-1297580565&amp;amp;mc_cid=af7cea22dd&amp;amp;mc_eid=6818060210#cdc_data_surveillance_section_8-previous-years"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority — 646 — are in Texas, where an outbreak in the western part of the state that’s approaching the three-month mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children died from measles-related illnesses in the epicenter in West Texas, and an adult in New Mexico who was not vaccinated died of a measles-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;As of Friday, April 25, the US has confirmed over 900 measles cases since the start of the year. The cases are across 29 states, but most are in or near Texas, where a massive outbreak continues to mushroom in close-knit, undervaccinated communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 24, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had tallied &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;884 cases across the country&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the Texas health department updated its outbreak total, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;adding 22 cases&lt;/a&gt; to its last count from Tuesday. That brings the national total to at least 906 confirmed cases. Most of the cases are in unvaccinated children and teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Texas has identified 664 cases since late January. Of those, 64 patients have been hospitalized, and two unvaccinated school-aged children with no underlying medical conditions have died of the disease. An unvaccinated adult in New Mexico also died from the infection, bringing this year's measles death toll to three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases and deaths are breaking records. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_5-yearly-measles-cases"&gt;In the past 30 years&lt;/a&gt;, the only year with more measles cases than the current tally was 2019, which saw 1,274 cases. Most of those cases were linked to large, extended outbreaks in New York City that took 11 months to quell. The US was just weeks away from losing its elimination status, an achievement earned in 2000 when the country first went 12 months without continuous transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, vaccination coverage of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine among US kindergartners has only fallen. National rates fell from 95 percent in 2019—the threshold considered necessary to keep measles from spreading—to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;92.7 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the 2023–24 school year, the most recent year for which there's data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On the brink&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, amid the record annual case tally, cases had only reached &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6817e1.htm"&gt;a total of 704 by April 26&lt;/a&gt;. With this year's tally already over 900, the country is on track to record a new high. Before 2019, the next highest case total for measles was in 1994. That year, the country saw 899 cases, which 2025 has already surpassed.&lt;/p&gt;

This connection was most evident among men and those classified as underweight or overweight. The findings, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.11.066" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that the distribution of body fat—not just overall body weight—may play a meaningful role in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While obesity and depression are known to often co-occur, many past studies have relied on body mass index (BMI) to define obesity. But BMI doesn’t distinguish between fat and muscle, nor does it capture where fat is located in the body. This limitation has led to mixed results in previous research. The current study aimed to take a closer look by using more precise tools to measure fat percentage in specific areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from 10,694 adults who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative study conducted in the United States. These participants had completed full-body scans using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), a technology that accurately measures fat, muscle, and bone. The scans allowed the researchers to analyze fat percentage in eight distinct regions: the legs, arms, trunk, head, android (abdominal), gynoid (hips and thighs), subtotal (excluding the head), and total body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess depression, the study used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a validated self-report measure of depressive symptoms. A score of 10 or higher on the PHQ-9 was used as a cutoff for clinically significant depression. Researchers also collected information about participants’ lifestyle habits, socioeconomic status, medical conditions, and biological markers, which allowed them to adjust their statistical models for many possible confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people in the highest quartile for total body fat had a significantly higher likelihood of reporting depression compared to those in the lowest quartile. This association remained even after adjusting for a wide range of demographic, behavioral, and health-related variables. Notably, the strongest associations were found for fat located in the legs, gynoid area, and subtotal region. People with higher head fat percentage also showed a modest increase in depression risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers examined differences by sex, they found that the association between body fat and depression was stronger in men than in women. This was especially true for fat in the legs and total body fat. In contrast, the connection was weaker or absent in women, except for some regions. This suggests that the effects of fat distribution on mood may operate differently depending on biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at whether the association varied across different BMI categories. Among individuals who were underweight or overweight, higher body fat percentages in several regions were consistently linked with increased depression risk. Interestingly, this pattern was not as clear in participants with a BMI in the normal range. This finding challenges the assumption that normal-weight individuals are at low risk for depression related to fat accumulation and highlights the importance of examining fat distribution rather than relying on weight alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest several possible explanations for these patterns. Biologically, excess fat tissue produces inflammatory molecules that may interfere with brain function and mood regulation. Hormones like leptin, which help control hunger and metabolism, can also become dysregulated in people with higher fat percentages, possibly affecting brain systems involved in emotion. Psychosocial factors may also play a role. Individuals with higher body fat, especially in visible areas, might experience greater stigma or body dissatisfaction, both of which can contribute to depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study adds to a growing body of evidence that body composition—and where fat is stored—can affect mental well-being. While BMI has long been the go-to measure in public health and clinical settings, this study shows that it may be too blunt an instrument to capture the nuances of how body fat influences mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths, the study has some limitations. Because it was cross-sectional, it cannot determine whether higher body fat leads to depression or whether depression contributes to changes in body composition. Depression itself can influence eating habits, physical activity, and metabolic processes, which could alter body fat levels over time. The study also relied on a single self-report questionnaire to assess depression, without clinical interviews or additional mental health screenings. Moreover, since the research focused on a United States population, the findings may not apply to other cultural or healthcare settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could address these limitations by following participants over time to explore how changes in fat distribution might influence mental health. It would also be useful to examine how interventions that reduce specific types of body fat—through diet, exercise, or other means—might affect depression symptoms, especially in men or in people whose weight falls outside the typical range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.11.066" target="_blank"&gt;Association between body fat percentage and depression: A cross-sectional study of NHANES&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Wenjun Gu, Kunming Bao, Xiaoming Li, Shaohang Xiang, Junhao He, Jinning He, Lixin Ye, and Zhidong Huang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 22:03:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPRFhPNURvT3JXQmdNdTV0Si02NXVCakg2WXNCWERqVndIMlVEaHdlc19VX3hKcGRRSm11Y2Fucm5FbUtXYmdZajBKYTYtOWxfQ05aUXNCb1FmZkc2Nmd5WkltN2hsb2pfN1BnZ2xVbFZHc2hUMXlMcVhwNktKa0VyNXAxeDVTc2xTeUFDSFFR</guid></item><item><title>Austin Public Health表示，当地报告了第二例麻疹病例- KUT | Second measles case reported locally, Austin Public Health says - KUT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQR0t1dkhPSzhjRG9LNnc0VlJ3N05sN3ZFaGZSMG8tZjBPRGh4M3JMY3pndlN5VEVZTnhYUHFwRWFETXFETG9ZT2RJRHV3UTZIMmFTVUFtcVZRS1diMWZ6X2NBel9JWXNpZnFBUXFjbmxiUnpKOUEwUmhabXBSX1lhemRtdWVDYW5oUlpKWEwtcVRndjR0cG5qdg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArtP-articleBody"&gt;
                                        &lt;p&gt;A Travis County adult is isolating after testing positive for measles, Austin Public Health officials announced Friday. It is the second confirmed local case of the virus this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APH &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/austintexas/second-measles-case-reported-in-travis-county?e=b0a255979d" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;representatives said&lt;/a&gt; the sick individual may have been exposed to the virus while traveling in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient visited a state outside of Texas that is experiencing a rise in measles cases," APH spokesperson William Malm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual was reportedly vaccinated against measles, a highly contagious disease that can have severe complications. Typically, two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine offers 97% protection against the measles virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While a vaccinated person can still get measles, they are more likely to experience mild symptoms and are less likely to spread it,” Dr. Desmar Walkes, Austin-Travis County health authority, said in a statement. “We consider measles to be one of the most contagious viruses we know and getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walkes said people who are vaccinated should check with their doctors to see if they should get a booster dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APH shared locations where the sick person may have exposed others. Those include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Office building at 300 Colorado St., Wednesday, April 16&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maaribu Coffee Shop, 1413 S. First St., Thursday, April 17, 8:45 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curra’s Restaurant, 614 E. Oltorf St., Thursday, April 17,  5:45 – 9:30 p.m. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starbucks 1920 E.

Riverside Drive, Suite A110, Sunday, April 20, 8 a.m. - 12 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;APH said more locations could be added to the list as contact tracing continues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were at the listed locations during the timeframe identified should monitor for symptoms including rash, cough and fever, through May 11, APH said. Those who are pregnant and unvaccinated, or generally immunocompromised, and visited those locations during those times should contact their doctors now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late February, APH announced a measles case in an unvaccinated infant, who contracted the virus while traveling internationally with family. No additional exposures were announced following that case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a measles outbreak is ongoing in West Texas, where more than 600 people have tested positive this year. Sixty-four of those individuals have been hospitalized. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, the vast majority of those cases involve people who were not vaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;

Using AI, the team revealed that PHGDH has a hidden DNA-binding function unrelated to its known enzymatic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This malfunction triggers early Alzheimer’s development, offering a new target for prevention.

While some particular genes, when mutated, can lead to Alzheimer’s, that connection only accounts for a small percentage of all Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of patients do not have a mutation in a known disease-causing gene; instead, they have “spontaneous” Alzheimer’s, and the causes for that are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discovering those causes could ultimately improve medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, treatment options for Alzheimer’s disease are very limited. And treatment responses are not outstanding at this moment,” said study senior author Sheng Zhong, a professor in the Shu Chien-Gene Lay Department of Bioengineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Zhong and his team took a closer look at phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which they had previously discovered as a potential blood biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study, they later found that expression levels of the PHGDH gene directly correlated with changes in the brain in Alzheimer’s disease; in other words, the higher the levels of protein and RNA produced by the PHGDH gene, the more advanced the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That correlation has since been verified in multiple cohorts from different medical centers, according to Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by this reproducible correlation, the research team decided to investigate in this latest study whether there was a causal effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice and human brain organoids, the researchers found that altering the amounts of PHGDH expression had consequential effects on Alzheimer’s disease: lower levels corresponded to less disease progression, whereas increasing the levels led to more disease advancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the researchers established that PHGDH is indeed a causal gene to spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In further support of that finding, the researchers determined—with the help of AI—that PHGDH plays a previously undiscovered role: it triggers a pathway that disrupts how cells in the brain turn genes on and off. And such a disturbance can cause issues, like the development of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Moonlighting role&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHGDH creates an enzyme key for the production of serine, an essential amino acid and a neurotransmitter. Because PHGDH’s enzymatic activity was its only known role, the researchers hypothesized that its metabolic function must be connected to an Alzheimer’s outcome. However, all their experiments designed to prove so failed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At that time, our study hit a wall, and we didn’t have a clue of what mechanism it is,” said Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But another Alzheimer’s project in his lab, which did not focus on PHGDH, changed all this. A year ago, that project revealed a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease: a widespread imbalance in the brain in the process where cells control which genes are turned on and off to carry out their specific roles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were curious if PHGDH had an unknown regulatory role in that process, and they turned to modern AI for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With AI, they could visualize the three-dimensional structure of the PHGDH protein. Within that structure, they discovered that the protein has a substructure that is very similar to a known DNA-binding domain in a class of known transcription factors. The similarity is solely in the structure and not in the protein sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhong said, “It really demanded modern AI to formulate the three-dimensional structure very precisely to make this discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After discovering the substructure, the team then demonstrated that with it, the protein can activate two critical target genes. That throws off the delicate balance, leading to several problems and eventually the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, PHGDH has a previously unknown role, independent of its enzymatic function, that through a novel pathway leads to spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ties back to the team’s earlier studies: the PHGDH gene produced more proteins in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients compared to the control brains, and those increased amounts of the protein in the brain triggered the imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While everyone has the PHGDH gene, the difference comes down to the expression level of the gene, or how many proteins are made by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Treatment option&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the researchers uncovered the mechanism, they wanted to figure out how to intervene and thus possibly identify a therapeutic candidate, which could help target the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many current treatments focus on treating the abnormal buildup of the sticky protein called beta-amyloid in the brain, some studies suggest that treating those plaques may be ineffective: essentially by that stage of accumulation, treatment is too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the critical pathway discovered in this study is upstream, so preventing this pathway can reduce amyloid plaque formation in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that PHGDH is such an important enzyme, there are past studies on its possible inhibitors. One small molecule, known as NCT-503, stood out to the researchers because it is not quite effective at impeding PHGDH’s enzymatic activity (the production of serine), which they did not want to change. NCT-503 is also able to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier, which is a desirable characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They turned to AI again for three-dimensional visualization and modeling. They found that NCT-503 can access that DNA-binding substructure of PHGDH, thanks to a binding pocket. With more testing, they saw that NCT-503 does indeed inhibit PHGDH’s regulatory role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers tested NCT-503 in two mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, they saw that it significantly alleviated Alzheimer’s progression. The treated mice demonstrated substantial improvement in their memory and anxiety tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tests were chosen because Alzheimer’s patients suffer from cognitive decline and increased anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers do acknowledge limitations of their study. One being that there is no perfect animal model for spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease. They could test NCT-503 only in the mouse models that are available, which are those with mutations in those known disease-causing genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the results are promising, according to Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now there is a therapeutic candidate with demonstrated efficacy that has the potential of being further developed into clinical tests,” said Zhong. “There may be entirely new classes of small molecules that can potentially be leveraged for development into future therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An advantage of small molecules is that they could even be administered orally, he added, unlike the current treatments that require infusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps will be to optimize the compound and subject it to FDA IND-enabling studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#513d3d3033383e2211243222357f343524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liezel Labios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsd.edu"&gt;UCSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liezel Labios – UCSD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.03.045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Transcriptional regulation by PHGDH drives amyloid pathology in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Sheng Zhong et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcriptional regulation by PHGDH drives amyloid pathology in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtually all individuals aged 65 or older develop at least early pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet most lack disease-causing mutations in APP, PSEN, or MAPT, and many do not carry the APOE4 risk allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises questions about AD development in the general population. Although transcriptional dysregulation has not traditionally been a hallmark of AD, recent studies reveal significant epigenomic changes in late-onset AD (LOAD) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that altered expression of the LOAD biomarker phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) modulates AD pathology in mice and human brain organoids independent of its enzymatic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHGDH has an uncharacterized role in transcriptional regulation, promoting the transcription of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha (IKKa) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in astrocytes, which suppress autophagy and accelerate amyloid pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blood-brain-barrier-permeable small-molecule inhibitor targeting PHGDH’s transcriptional function reduces amyloid pathology and improves AD-related behavioral deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight transcriptional regulation in LOAD and suggest therapeutic strategies beyond targeting familial mutations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 21:27:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9EN1dVRzdCdFhRTGdiemh5NUNQVjNWeDhqLUd2dnRtQTZxcVM5U0lscFlRQ0U2eDQyQjBtSWZJNFB0QmhZMTF6TkNZaUlDQ19SMkVpMjlTZ2FMX2JEQ2M1RTRobUlJZVlxZXc</guid></item><item><title>忙碌周末的高蛋白晚餐（每周计划和购物清单！ ） - EatingWell | High-Protein Sheet-Pan Dinners for Busy Weeknights (Weekly Plan &amp; Shopping List!) - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxQbG42LUZEeHpYTEt2NmxMUFVvMTg2ZWZTeXFsQ0lCdms1SWRReE9NQUFWVGVCNWlObWtBQU5Ea1BEczF0ZVdpSVczdEpPaGpteGZzNl91NjNLbVZmVmJpa2xSdGNmdXd1X29xYWNEUmZhQi14QlVlLWNzZWs1Z1FMUTR0V3JOc2YwZ2tBYkhDYU8xX1VTYUZWTzVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-article-intro_1-0" class="comp mntl-article-intro mntl-block article-content__description"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s something so gratifying about preparing a whole dinner on a single sheet pan. You cook your protein and your veggies all together, so they can absorb each other’s flavors and the flavors of whatever you season or dress them with. And when dinner is done, you just have one pan to clean. What is also satisfying about these sheet-pan dinners is that they’re all packed with protein, delivering 15 grams or more per serving. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; is not only essential for muscle growth and repair but it also helps you feel fuller for longer and supports your immune system, among other benefits.

And choosing a salt-free version adds lots of flavor, negating the need for added salt. Once the chicken has roasted for 10 minutes, you’ll add some broccoli florets and cherry tomatoes to the pan to cook until tender. For a final touch and contrasting creamy texture, sprinkle crumbled feta on top. Serve everything with the pan juices and some whole-grain bread.

Researchers found that clusters of serotonin neurons compete and collaborate, shaping when and how serotonin is released throughout the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery challenges older views of a uniform serotonin signal and may have major implications for understanding mood disorders and how the brain handles binary decisions. The team identified a brain circuit involving the lateral habenula that helps compute “go” or “don’t go” decisions in response to perceived threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serotonin Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Serotonin neurons form interconnected ensembles that regulate dynamic serotonin release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Circuits:&lt;/strong&gt; A newly identified circuit links the lateral habenula to serotonin activity, guiding binary decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; This new understanding could inform targeted therapies for mood disorders like depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our lives are filled with binary decisions – choices between one of two alternatives. But what’s really happening inside our brains when we engage in this kind of decision-making?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine-led study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; sheds new light on these big questions, illuminating a general principle of neural processing in a mysterious region of the midbrain that is the very origin of our central serotonin (5-HT) system, a key part of the nervous system involved in a remarkable range of cognitive and behavioral functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109153"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a person at a cross roads." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The research team’s work has implications for how our brain – an organ with profoundly intricate wiring of neurons with multitudes of enmeshed connections – is involved in day-to-day decision making. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current dominating model is that individual 5-HT neurons are acting independently one from another. While it had previously been suggested that 5-HT neurons may rather be connected with one another, it had not been directly demonstrated. That is what we did here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also identify an intriguing processing role – or a computation – that is supported by this particular type of connectivity between 5-HT neurons,” says Dr. Jean-Claude Béïque, full professor in the Faculty’s Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and co-director of the uOttawa Brain and Mind Research Institute’s Centre for Neural Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international research team’s work involved a mixture of several experimental approaches such as electrophysiology, cellular imaging, optogenetics and behavioral approaches, along with mathematical modeling and computer simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forging advances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean that serotonin neurons clustered together in the brainstem are not independent actors largely keeping to themselves but are actually sending axons to the rest of the brain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my view, the paper’s main takeaway is that the mammalian serotonin system is far more anatomically and functionally complex than what we previously imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is knowledge that could potentially help develop targeted therapeutics for mood disorders like major depressive disorder,” says Dr. Michael Lynn, the study’s first author and a former member of Dr. Béïque’s Faculty of Medicine lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lynn received his PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Ottawa in October 2023. He’s now working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oxford, in the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says the team’s findings are important because it turns out that there are distinct groups of serotonin neurons with their own activity patterns, each controlling serotonin release in a particular region of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has implications for the “winner-takes-all” principle of neuroscience – an idea applied in computational models of neural networks in which neurons essentially compete to get activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new principles uncovered in this paper suggest that these distinct ensembles can interact in some scenarios: ‘winning’ serotonin ensembles with high activity can strongly reduce serotonin release from ‘losing’ serotonin ensembles with lower activity levels,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These imply a more complex, dynamic set of rules about how and when serotonin is released throughout the brain, contrasting with an older view of a more monolithic signal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decisions, decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team’s work has implications for how our brain – an organ with profoundly intricate wiring of neurons with multitudes of enmeshed connections – is involved in day-to-day decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They determined how the lateral habenula, a region that is activated when we are frustrated and that is implicated in major depression, ultimately controls the activity of serotonin neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habenular neurons are also believed to encode the level of threat that is perceived from a particular environment, or perhaps even from our actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Béïque explains it like this: “Do we jump from the high diving board at the pool? Or only from the low one? Do we walk down that very dark alley, or do we avoid it?  When is dark too dark?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Somehow our brain must compute features of our world – including how threatening a particular environment is – and come up with a binary output: you go, or you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think we have identified a circuit that participates in that very computation that guides our everyday decisions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s next for the research team as they build on the advances they have forged over several years with this methodical, innovative examination of the serotonin system? They aim to focus on behavioral studies with mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, the behavioral manifestations of the computation we discovered were somewhat artificial behavior. We’re currently trying to see if we can see similar things when mice are behaving in more naturalistic environments,” Dr. Béïque says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talent-rich research team for the new &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; paper included the uOttawa Faculty of Medicine’s Dr. Richard Naud, a computational neuroscientist who was the senior author on a recent serotonin-related study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, and Sean Geddes, director of Innovation and Partnerships at Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this serotonin and decision-making research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b6c6dad9d1d9c2ded3f6c3d9c2c2d7c1d798d5d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paul Logothetis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uottawa.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Paul Logothetis – University of Ottawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01912-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nonlinear recurrent inhibition through facilitating serotonin release in the raphe&lt;/a&gt;” by Jean-Claude Béïque et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonlinear recurrent inhibition through facilitating serotonin release in the raphe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) receive a constellation of long-range inputs, yet guiding principles of local circuit organization and underlying computations in this nucleus are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using inputs from the lateral habenula to interrogate the processing features of the mouse DRN, we uncovered 5-HT1A receptor-mediated recurrent connections between 5-HT neurons, refuting classical theories of autoinhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellular electrophysiology and imaging of a genetically encoded 5-HT sensor revealed that these recurrent inhibitory connections spanned the raphe, were slow, stochastic, strongly facilitating and gated spike output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features collectively conveyed highly nonlinear dynamics to this network, generating excitation-driven inhibition and winner-take-all computations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vivo optogenetic activation of lateral habenula inputs to DRN, at frequencies where these computations are predicted to ignite, transiently disrupted expression of a reward-conditioned response in an auditory conditioning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California is heading toward another record year for cases of valley fever, the disease caused by fungal spores linked to cycles of drought and precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 3,123 reported cases of valley fever in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first three months of the year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, according to state health officials — roughly double the 10-year average for the first-quarter time period. Cases ranged from a low of 801 in 2016 to 3,011 last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected with the fungus won’t experience symptoms, and their bodies will fight off the infection naturally. Those who do suffer symptoms however are often hard-pressed to recognize them, as they resemble the onset of COVID or the flu, further complicating efforts to address the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by inhaling spores of coccidioides, a fungal pathogen that thrives in the drier and dustier regions of the state. The fungus is released when the dry soil where it grows is disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We actually had sort of seen this coming, just based on the climate cycle of the last few years,” said George R. Thompson, a professor of medicine at the UC Davis School of Medicine and a specialist in invasive fungal infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00202-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;has shown that patterns of drought and precipitation play important roles in the number of valley fever cases in California, said Doua Ge Yang, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Public Health. “When there are several years of drought in California, followed by a wet winter, and then a dry summer,” there are increases in valley fever cases for the following two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said 2023 typified such a scenario, and as predicted, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-12-27/valley-fever-cases-spike-in-california"&gt;2024 resulted in a record-high case count&lt;/a&gt;, with 12,637 cases recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Valley fever is on the rise in California,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the numbers for 2025 are so far higher than any previously recorded first quarter, Yang said health officials can’t predict whether it will remain a record year. She also noted that all the numbers from 2024 and 2025 are considered preliminary — and therefore demographic issues such as age, sex and race cannot yet be reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to patterns of rain and drought, research shows that other factors can play a role in incidents of valley fever — including soil disturbance, such as the kind accompanying construction activity, wild fires and even archaeological digs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction workers, firefighters and archaeologists working in the dry, arid regions of the state are at increased risk of getting the disease — especially as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/04/30/californias-population-is-increasing/" target="_blank"&gt;Californians move into these previously less inhabited regions of the state.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, at least 19 people who &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-10-02/the-threat-of-valley-fever-is-growing-in-central-california"&gt;attended Lightning in a Bottle, a five-day music and art festival held at Buena Vista lake in Kern County&lt;/a&gt;, came down with the disease — including several who reported severe effects that  included pneumonia-like symptoms, rashes, headaches and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The festival’s organizers will be holding the event again this year at the same location. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.libfestival.org/dustmitigation" target="_blank"&gt;According to the festival website&lt;/a&gt;, organizers will try to reduce dust by applying water to the ground to keep it in place, adding artificial turf in front of the stages for dancing, and reducing the number of motorized vehicles used by staff around the site, and placing additional wood chips over heavy traffic areas to suppress dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because most people clear the infection on their own, the true number of afflicted people is not known. If a person’s immune system is unable to clear the infection  and it is left untreated, it can cause death or permanent disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment varies depending upon severity, but antifungal drugs, such as  fluconazole (Diflucan) or itraconazole (Sporanox, Tolsura), are the most common medications used. However, they come with serious side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, dry skin, dry mouth and chapped lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While several Central and Southern California counties have seen recent increases in their case counts, Monterey’s numbers have ballooned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, there were 22 cases reported during the first quarter in the Central California county; this year, the number is 217.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;County health officials said they began seeing a surge in November of last year, at which point they sent out &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.countyofmonterey.gov/Home/Components/News/News/11080/" target="_blank"&gt;a health advisory&lt;/a&gt; to local medical providers and clinics providing information about the disease and testing guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monterey County spokeswoman Karen Smith said that many residents had experienced severe disease and delays in their treatment and diagnosis. She said rates were highest for people who live in the southern part of the county and in the largely agricultural Salinas Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the county encourages people to reduce their risk of getting the disease by avoiding breathing in dirt and dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson, the UC Davis doctor and researcher, said there has been anecdotal evidence that the disease may be increasing in severity, and there are concerns that it may also have acquired some immunity to the common antifungal medicines used to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some theorize that the widespread use of antifungal chemicals on crops in areas where the fungus is endemic may be contributing to its resistance, but research on the topic is only just getting underway and answers so far are elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there’s a statewide effort looking into these issues, that includes participation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state’s public health department, UC Davis, UC San Francisco, and  Cal State Fresno and Cal State Bakersfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the disease for years had largely been sidelined in public health circles, as attention and funding was targeted at other pathogens that had wider and more severe impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hate to disparage that, but I think with limited resources, public health agencies do have to really prioritize certain pathogens,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:38:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQRVRZbGp5czhTenR5RzQ1RlFvVGg5ODc1ZTd4TVd0dks1dkNwVHlHUFI3TENUXy1sOW81NjI1UEdla09leE9obmtPYkNIcU9RbWstT2VMTmVfbWFWWnVfd1ExWVdFaHFNNzRtd2NPYVEwcFoxTXN0QXVMQkVlM28xSlp0SEpFUQ</guid></item><item><title>详细的性感和厌恶感觉地图揭示了女性如何体验性触摸- PsyPost | Detailed erogenous and aversive sensation maps reveal how women experience sexual touch - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPN2JqZ1JFSGJNUjRucmNCVG9RRHVFUXJQYktydjREU0t5M3hDc1FlRWZqUTRWLUdwWTE0ZlAzdzJ3UWJmNkJLVDFYR0JzRVlSODY2SXJKTXkxbUdZeFI2cDhxSlNuU2dwS3AxQUR3MGkzM1BHS0hEOUF0Q0U1YW82cVJISVlWSHFoQ1ZIVG5tbkhLYWtDdkh4enN4WEVVWko1Qk0zbFdIcEZfb2xzeVpHcDBn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers have created comprehensive maps of women’s erogenous and aversive zones, pinpointing exactly which areas of the vulva, vagina, and breasts contribute most to sexual pleasure—and which are often avoided. Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jsxmed/qdae143" target="_blank"&gt;The Journal of Sexual Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the study offers new insights into sexual sensation and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to fill several gaps in the current scientific understanding of sexual sensation. Past research has often excluded people with vulvas, overlooked internal genital structures, or failed to quantify how important specific areas are to sexual pleasure. Additionally, there has been almost no systematic study of areas that individuals dislike having touched during sex—referred to in this research as aversive sensation zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these gaps, the research team created a detailed anatomical survey, approved by the Cedars-Sinai Institutional Review Board, that asked respondents to indicate which specific areas of the breasts, vulva, and vagina they found pleasurable or aversive during partnered sex. A total of 499 women completed the survey, but only the 441 who reported having had partnered sexual experience were included in the final analysis. Participants were between 18 and 83 years old, with an average age of 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using anatomically precise illustrations of both external and internal genital structures, respondents selected specific zones they found pleasurable during sex and rated how important each zone was to their overall sexual pleasure on a 10-point scale. For aversive zones, they indicated which body parts they disliked being touched and selected from a list of potential reasons, such as pain, oversensitivity, shame, or past negative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequently selected erogenous areas were in the vulva, with 82% of respondents identifying at least one pleasurable zone in that region. The vaginal introitus, periurethral area, and glans clitoris were the top three choices. (The vaginal introitus is the external opening of the vagina, the periurethral area is the region immediately surrounding the urethral opening, and the glans clitoris is the visible, sensitive tip of the clitoris.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glans clitoris received the highest average importance rating of all areas in the study, with a score of 9 out of 10. This supports existing evidence that the clitoris plays a central role in sexual pleasure for many women, but the prominence of the vaginal introitus was an unexpected result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast tissue and nipples were also commonly cited as sources of pleasure. About 58% of participants identified breast tissue as an erogenous zone, while 43% selected the nipples. However, the nipples were also the most frequently selected aversive zone among the breast subareas. Reasons given for nipple aversion included oversensitivity and pain. Notably, younger women were more likely to report pleasure in breast zones, suggesting some age-related variation in sensitivity or preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses regarding the vagina highlighted the superficial anterior wall—often associated with the “G-spot”—as the most pleasurable area inside the vaginal canal. Nearly half of respondents selected this area, giving it a high average importance rating. Fewer people selected the cervix or deep vaginal walls, and these areas were more frequently flagged as aversive, primarily due to pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anus was the most frequently selected aversive zone in the entire study, with 34% of participants reporting that they disliked its stimulation during sex. While 12% did identify it as pleasurable, the overwhelming majority of negative responses reflected not only physical discomfort but also emotional responses such as shame or embarrassment. This pattern persisted across different age groups, suggesting that cultural stigma around anal contact remains prevalent despite its growing visibility in media and sex education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most results were consistent across demographic subgroups, age emerged as a meaningful variable. Younger respondents were more likely to identify a wider range of areas—across the breasts, vulva, and vagina—as pleasurable. This could reflect both generational differences in sexual norms and physiological differences related to hormonal changes. Many respondents were likely in perimenopause or menopause, a life stage known to impact genital sensation and libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings offer potential applications beyond academic research. Erogenous maps could help clinicians, therapists, and surgeons understand individual variability in sexual sensation, especially for people undergoing medical treatments or procedures that affect the genital area. For example, individuals recovering from cancer treatment, gender-affirming surgeries, or pelvic floor trauma may benefit from personalized sensation maps to monitor changes or tailor interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These maps also challenge conventional ideas about which body parts are considered “universally” pleasurable. For instance, while the glans clitoris is often highlighted in discussions about female sexual pleasure, this study suggests that other regions—like the vaginal introitus or the superficial anterior vaginal wall—are equally or even more significant for some women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aversive zone data provide insights into the emotional and psychological dimensions of sexual experience. Pain and oversensitivity were the most common reasons for aversion across all areas. But when it came to the anus, feelings of disgust and shame were disproportionately high. These emotional responses underscore the need for more open, nonjudgmental conversations about sexuality, as well as individualized sexual health education that respects diverse experiences and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths—including a relatively large sample size and anatomically detailed illustrations—this study has limitations. Its retrospective and anonymous nature limited the amount of background information collected about participants. Only 62% of respondents had engaged in sexual activity within the year prior to the survey, which means that some data relied on recollections of older experiences. The survey also excluded transgender and gender-diverse individuals, so its findings cannot be generalized to all people with vulvas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on this study by including more diverse populations and tracking changes in sensation over time. For example, it would be useful to examine how erogenous and aversive zones shift after hormonal changes, medical treatments, or use of specific sexual health interventions such as pelvic floor therapy or vibratory stimulation. Studies could also investigate neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to reorganize sensory maps—and how this might affect sexual function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study,  “&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article-abstract/22/1/7/7905380?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;Anatomic maps of erogenous and aversive sensation zones of the breasts, vulva, and vagina: A questionnaire-based study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jenna Stelmar, Michael Zaliznyak, Sandeep Sandhu, Dylan Isaacson, Erin Duralde, Shannon M.

But eating that much chicken may not be as healthy as once thought, according to a recent study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/8/1370" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the study, researchers investigated the connection between poultry consumption, gastrointestinal &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2025/04/24/cancer-prevention-progress-setback/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and early death. Poultry refers to all forms of birds, including chicken, turkey, duck, and game birds like quail and pheasants. Examining data from 4,869 middle-aged Italian participants over 19 years, who answered surveys about their food and beverage consumption, researchers found that white meat consumption (rabbit and poultry) was highest among those who died of gastrointestinal cancers—&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/childhood-exposure-bacteria-colorectal-cancer-rates-millennials-gen-xers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt;, liver, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, and rectal cancer, for example—with poultry intake accounting for 33% of their white meat intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who consumed over 300 grams of poultry per week—about 3.5 three-ounce servings—had a 27% higher mortality rate from all causes. For men in particular, that rate jumped to 61%. For gastrointestinal cancer specifically, they found that consuming 100 to 200 grams of poultry per week was associated with a 65% increased risk of death from gastrointestinal cancer compared to other cancers, while participants who consumed over 300 grams of poultry every week were 127% more likely to die from gastrointestinal cancer, with this risk even greater at 161% for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much chicken should you eat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the study, the less poultry consumed the better.

As poultry consumption increased, so did mortality risk—and the results were even more pronounced for those who consumed higher portions of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Study participants, who at age 83, consumed less than 100 grams of poultry per week had half the mortality risk from gastrointestinal cancer than those who consumed more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers also suggested that the way chicken is cooked may affect how it impacts your health. White meat cooked at higher temperatures—like grilling or barbecuing—or for long periods in a stew could form high levels of agents that cause genetic mutation, which could influence the development of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to overall meat consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers found that overall meat consumption plays a substantial role in mortality risk—even when following one of the most recommended diets for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Participants who died of non-gastrointestinal cancers had diets where red meat accounted for over 65% of their total meat intake, as compared to 56% and 58% among those who died of gastrointestinal cancers and other causes, respectively. Over half of cancer-related deaths occurred in people who consumed over 400 grams of meat every week—even when on the &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2025/04/14/mediterranean-diet-heath-benefits-science/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We believe it is beneficial to moderate poultry consumption, alternating it with other equally valuable protein sources, such as fish,” the authors wrote. “We also believe it is essential to focus more on cooking methods, avoiding high temperatures and prolonged cooking times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more on diet and health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This story was originally featured on &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/chicken-per-week-mortality-cancer-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fortune.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNd2xVaGw1dGhkemtTakpzUU1IOHJLcmloYktwQmZlMHF6R01hblZENi1jTldPNjVESU1HMkJjVV9rY2lVQ2VYOEtrZF83T1hKZUp3UkZPOG5FSWVFdXotMm9QTFFDaHdGX2FpSDh5Vzh5eXR4aU05R210M0hEd0xhM29Ic2h5OXdIOENkUlNB</guid></item><item><title>研究人员警告说，每周吃这么多鸡肉可能会增加死亡风险-财富 | Researchers warn that eating this amount of chicken per week could increase your mortality risk - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTFBkb3h1Q0tXSVJ6ZGlaNGZQZU5OVnFmM041SzBjODh0Wms3M3M2dXUwY2dPb2tQSVRJdUNGZllkdU80ZW14S05iM0NFeEZMOVhCYWdidTQ0WFBtUElPTjFIRHhfZE11SmQzNDd0WjUyV2JQZEJOdGZXZnNxb20?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBkb3h1Q0tXSVJ6ZGlaNGZQZU5OVnFmM041SzBjODh0Wms3M3M2dXUwY2dPb2tQSVRJdUNGZllkdU80ZW14S05iM0NFeEZMOVhCYWdidTQ0WFBtUElPTjFIRHhfZE11SmQzNDd0WjUyV2JQZEJOdGZXZnNxb20</guid></item><item><title>美国有近900例麻疹病例。以下是您需要了解的信息- ABC新闻 | There are nearly 900 measles cases in the US.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first item to add to your grocery list is apples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He reveals that apples - which have around 95 calories per fruit - have something called chlorogenic acid inside their flesh,  which 'turns on your brown fat' to burn down your white fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A review of the health benefits of apples conducted by food scientists at Cornell University also praises the fruit as a weight loss aid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After reviewing research, they concluded: 'Based on these epidemiological studies, it appears that apples may play a large role in reducing the risk of a wide variety of chronic disease and maintaining a healthy lifestyle in general. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Of the papers reviewed, apples were most consistently associated with reduced risk of cancer, heart disease, asthma, and type II diabetes when compared to other fruits and vegetables and other sources of flavonoids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Apple consumption was also positively associated with increased lung function and increased weight loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li's second and third food recommendations to slim down are broccoli and kale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These contain a phytochemical called sulforaphane, which also helps to activate brown fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also low in calories, with both providing around 30 calories per cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One of the food expert's favorite foods to promote weight loss is bok choy, due to its low calorie content, high fiber and nutrient density&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert's fourth favorite food to promote weight loss is bok choy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to its low calorie content (just 9 calories per cup), high fiber and nutrient density, Di Li says it is a great vegetable for dieters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber helps maintain a healthy weight, as it makes you feel fuller for longer and therefore reduces the likelihood of overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on the best way to prepare the bok choy, he says: 'You cut off the bottoms, you wash the leaves, take a wok or a skillet, a little extra virgin olive oil, a little garlic, [and] sauté that up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He highlights that instead of butter, he recommends using olive oil, with this being his fifth fat-reducing superfood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it is calorie-rich - with around 120 calories per tablespoon - it provides numerous health benefits due to its nutritional content, especially extra virgin olive oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two ingredients Di Li points to in olive oil for their health boosting properties are hydroxytyrosol and oleocanthal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest hydroxytyrosol can increase fatty acid oxidation, potentially boosting the body's ability to burn fat, and it may also help reduce inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity, further contributing to weight management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, studies have shown oleocanthal may contribute to weight loss and improved heart health due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It reduces inflammation in a way similar to ibuprofen, by blocking inflammatory enzymes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li concludes: 'Now you actually have the greens and the olive oil, that will trigger your brown fat to turn it down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 17:32:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOZmFkTkN4MUtzbERXOXdDYVVkd25uX2N0VmdhZjRfdS1iU2RWZmJpVGVISWFNZWZ6SXExQmpoRHdFU0lyRk5rUXZrdG1NVFZXaEktcGZHYnZ3cFRQeThWTFNESU0zV1RkaGpyelBFUWlNR0pJTF9UWDVHZ1NidGRaWlpNSXN4R3dWUEkwTmVTRjlCUFR2Q1ZrVTlGUVR5M1Vwcmo00gGoAUFVX3lxTE93eXRKeHJYSDhPQVhULUN1OEdPdzNydTVkWTd3UkMxR3RvdVp0clVBVjhreFpzdjVkaUFXaEtWcGllaGlmS0tsN19pZk9BUGdyckxEM1VBNDF3cnJ3VzhpRW5MUzZpc0Z6YnkxbWlkcGhsV01pZnhwdFdWdTRsM3VLQW4tcEZhRldoNVFQNW9EcGw0Y3ZCUGJUYXdDNGxqRHZoRFRpWTBkZw</guid></item><item><title>这种新物质可能有一天会阻断IBS和哮喘等严重炎症反应- Gizmodo | This Novel Substance Might One Day Block Severe Inflammatory Reactions Like IBS and Asthma - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxPeEt1ZzNreU14aWtqOVFWYVF1VDNCMTdFdG44UjVLNGRkeWlwZ2Qxc284SHQzeTBwNzJqNVQtVnFkOEQ3RklMOHFSZ1FoRW5GQ2lpbTZfdTdBOWx5Y2w2a1U4dV9uWjZ4bmFKUHpfTk9QY2hwcGJLQlRpdTJLTk1rRE96S2dFWExuQ3dNekJCWFRmRU5iNWJhY2l2ZmFPMlFtcXMxbF8xSHQzbjZobEN1LTFwRTU2a0dzR1N2X2dB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/mast-cells"&gt;Mast cells&lt;/a&gt; are part of our immune system, protecting our body from viruses, bacteria, and even harmful substances released by snake and insect bites. When alerted to the presence of such invaders, mast cells can create mucus, trigger swelling and itching, and make muscles contract in our airways, stomach, and intestines. While these symptoms allow the body to destroy or expel invaders, oversensitive mast cells cause allergic reactions, including life-threatening and hard-to-treat conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02209-8"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Monday in the journal Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, researchers have developed a compound that blocks mast cells from triggering particularly hard-to-treat and sometimes life-threatening reactions. These include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), asthma, chronic itching, and migraines. Traditionally considered pseudo-allergic reactions, these conditions have more recently been classified as a type of allergy, according to the researchers. The compound seems to greatly reduce symptoms, and as a consequence, lower fatality risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We thus see this as an extremely promising substance,” Christa Müller, a co-author of the study who researches medicinal chemistry of membrane proteins at the University of Bonn, said in a university &lt;a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/news/072-2025"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unlike some allergic reactions, in which immune cells called antibodies alert mast cells to the presence of invaders, these hard-to-treat conditions occur when mast cells are triggered through direct activation not involving antibodies. This triggers reactions “of a specific nature that have been difficult to treat, and remain so to this day,” Müller explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;15 years ago, Müller and colleagues identified a receptor named MRGPRX2 in the mast cells’ membrane that “switches on” these sorts of reactions when &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/cell-signaling-14047077/#:~:text=Conclusion,farther%20to%20reach%20their%20targets."&gt;certain molecules&lt;/a&gt; attach to it. “To prevent this reaction, the switch would have to be blocked somehow,” Müller continued. “The question was: how?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address this, the team tested promising compounds from a collection of 40,000 previously gathered by Müller’s department. “We used cells that light up when MRGPRX2 is activated, so we could then test whether the substances effectively block activation of the receptor, switching off the light signal,” explained Ghazl Al Hamwi, Müller’s doctoral student and first author of the study. In this way, the team discovered a molecule that can attach to the receptor and block it, effectively switching it off.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They used that molecule to develop a substance that still works in very low doses, and proved its efficacy at eliminating life-threatening allergic reactions in lab mice and blocking the MRGPRX2 receptor on isolated human mast cells. They also claimed the molecule only blocks the intended receptor, which avoids the risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Al Hamwi, Müller, and their colleagues have since improved the substance’s efficacy and duration, more animal and eventually human trials will have to take place before it can be approved and commercialized as a drug. Nevertheless, it holds potentially life-saving implications for patients with some inflammatory conditions and those at risk of anaphylactic shock.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Researchers found that dream recall is most strongly influenced by a person’s attitude toward dreams, their tendency to mind-wander, and specific sleep characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who value dreams more, daydream frequently, and experience longer sleep with less deep sleep are more likely to remember their dreams. These findings underscore the complex relationship between sleep, memory, and our waking thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attitude Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Valuing dreams is linked to more frequent recall, though not necessarily better content memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind Wandering Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Frequent daydreamers tend to recall dreams more often, suggesting a shared mental process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Pattern Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Longer sleep duration with less deep sleep boosts dream recall; winter months see lower recall rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although almost everyone dreams, the ability to recall these experiences varies significantly between individuals. Research has sought to better understand this phenomenon by analysing the factors influencing dream recall. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that three main factors determine whether a person will remember their dream upon waking: attitude towards dreams, tendency to mind wandering, and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dreams can be defined as subjective conscious experiences generated by our brain during sleep when we are significantly (although not totally) disconnected from the external environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dream experiences draw on previously acquired memories and beliefs and therefore have relevant aspects of continuity with the thoughts, concerns, and salient experiences of our waking self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientific evidence suggests that most people dream during sleep and do so for a large part of the night, dream recall already seems to show large interindividual variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several studies have indicated female gender, younger age, a positive attitude towards dreaming, frequent daydreaming, and fantasy proneness as factors associated with a higher dream recall frequency, other investigations produced partially inconsistent or even contradictory results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the support of the BIAL Foundation, Giulio Bernardi (IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy) coordinated a study that sought to better understand this phenomenon by analysing the factors that influence dream recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the team used a multimodal database that collected, between 2020 and 2024, dream reports, personal characteristics, and cognitive, psychometric, and neurophysiological measures in 217 healthy adults (18-70 years old, 116 females, 101 males).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article The individual determinants of morning dream recall, published in February in the journal &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology,&lt;/em&gt; revealed the results of the research, pointing to three main factors that determine whether a person wakes up with the memory of the dream experience: the attitude towards dreams, the tendency to mind wandering, and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding attitude towards dreams, the results indicate that people who attribute greater significance to dreaming are more likely to report the experience of dreaming upon waking, but this heightened interest does not necessarily enhance their ability to remember the content of their experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of note, although frequent dream recall may foster an interest in the meaning or significance of dreams, the direction of causality remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tendency to mind wandering emerges in this study as a robust positive predictor of dream recall. The association between mind wandering, so-called ‘daydreaming’, and observed dream recall may indicate a greater propensity to spontaneously generate dream-like experiences, regardless of external stimuli and vigilance states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that dream recall seems to be influenced by sleep patterns, i.e., individuals who typically have long sleep episodes, coupled with a low proportion of deep sleep, show a greater probability of dream recall compared to those experiencing shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon also shows seasonal fluctuations, with dream recall typically being lower during Winter than during Spring and Autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these factors, individual differences in the ability to recall dream content depend on vulnerability to interference and age. Ageing can be associated with changes in sleep patterns – particularly a decrease in long and light sleep periods – which can affect dream recall processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research reinforces the idea that dreams are shaped by inter- and intra-individual factors, which opens up new perspectives for understanding their connection with memory and the human mind”, says Giulio Bernardi, emphasising that “the study of dreams is essential as it is known that they play an essential role in learning, in the memory consolidation and even in our mental and physical health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dream recall and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fundacaobial.com/com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Giulio Bernardi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fundacaobial.com/com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Giulio Bernardi – BIAL Foundation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00191-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The individual determinants of morning dream recall&lt;/a&gt;” by Giulio Bernardi et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The individual determinants of morning dream recall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that (almost) everyone dreams during their sleep and may actually do so for a large part of the night.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that our waistlines often expand in middle age, but the problem isn't strictly cosmetic. Belly fat accelerates aging and slows down metabolism, increasing our risk for developing diabetes, heart problems and other chronic diseases. Exactly how age transforms a six pack into a softer stomach, however, is murky.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Now preclinical research by City of Hope has uncovered the cellular culprit behind age-related abdominal fat, providing new insights into why our midsections widen with middle age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj0430" target="_blank"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; today in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, the findings suggest a novel target for future therapies to prevent belly flab and extend our healthy lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People often lose muscle and gain body fat as they age—even when their body weight remains the same," said Qiong (Annabel) Wang, Ph.D., the study's co-corresponding author and an associate professor of molecular and cellular endocrinology at City of Hope's Arthur Riggs Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolism Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We discovered aging triggers the arrival of a new type of adult stem cell and enhances the body's massive production of new fat cells, especially around the belly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the UCLA laboratory co-corresponding author Xia Yang, Ph.D., the scientists conducted a series of mouse experiments later validated on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human cells&lt;/a&gt;. Wang and her colleagues focused on white adipose tissue (WAT), the fatty tissue responsible for age-related weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's well-known that fat cells grow larger with age, the scientists suspected that WAT also expanded by producing new fat cells, meaning it may have an unlimited potential to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the researchers focused on adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs), a group of stem cells in WAT that evolve into fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The City of Hope team first transplanted APCs from young and older &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; into a second group of young mice. The APCs from the older animals rapidly generated a colossal amount of fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the team transplanted APCs from young mice into the older mice, however, the stem cells did not manufacture many new fat cells. The results confirmed that older APCs are equipped to independently make new fat cells, regardless of their host's age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell RNA sequencing, the scientists next compared APC gene activity in young and older mice. While barely active in young mice, APCs woke up with a vengeance in middle-aged mice and began pumping out new fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While most adult stem cells' capacity to grow wanes with age, the opposite holds true with APCs—aging unlocks these cells' power to evolve and spread," said Adolfo Garcia-Ocana, Ph.D., the Ruth B. &amp;amp; Robert K. Lanman Endowed Chair in Gene Regulation &amp;amp; Drug Discovery Research and chair of the Department of Molecular &amp;amp; Cellular Endocrinology at City of Hope. "This is the first evidence that our bellies expand with age due to the APCs' high output of new fat cells."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging also transformed the APCs into a new type of stem cell called committed preadipocytes, age-specific (CP-As). Arising in middle age, CP-A cells actively churn out new fat cells, explaining why older mice gain more weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/signaling+pathway/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;signaling pathway&lt;/a&gt; called leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) proved critical for promoting these CP-A cells to multiply and evolve into fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"We discovered that the body's fat-making process is driven by LIFR. While young mice don't require this signal to make fat, older mice do," explained Wang. "Our research indicates that LIFR plays a crucial role in triggering CP-As to create new fat cells and expand &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/belly+fat/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt; in older mice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell RNA sequencing on samples from people of various ages, Wang and her colleagues next studied APCs from human tissue in the lab. Again, the team also identified similar CP-A cells that had an increased number in middle-aged people's tissue. Their discovery also illustrates that CP-As in humans have high capacity in creating new &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fat+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fat cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings highlight the importance of controlling new fat-cell formation to address age-related obesity," said Wang. "Understanding the role of CP-As in metabolic disorders and how these cells emerge during aging could lead to new medical solutions for reducing belly fat and improving health and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research will focus on tracking CP-A cells in animal models, observing CP-A cells in humans and developing new strategies that eliminate or block the cells to prevent age-related fat gain.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A common bacteria in our gut might be stirring up more trouble than we knew. A study out this week has found evidence that a mutagenic toxin produced by some strains of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; can trigger early onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, San Diego led the research, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Nature. They found a link between exposure to the toxin, called colibactin, and colorectal cancers more likely to happen in young adults. The findings could help explain why the rate of early onset colorectal cancer has mysteriously risen in recent years, though more research is needed to confirm a causative connection, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer, with roughly 150,000 Americans diagnosed with it every year. It’s also the second most leading cause of death by cancer, killing around 50,000 Americans annually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with many types of cancer, the incidence and death rate of colorectal cancer has been steadily declining over time. However, this decline isn’t equally distributed, since the incidence of colorectal cancer has been increasing in young and middle-aged adults. According to the American Cancer Society, rates of colorectal cancer among people younger than 50 have &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt; by 2.4% per year between 2012 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists aren’t sure why these cancers have become more common in younger Americans, though some research has pointed the finger at &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/colorectal-cancer-in-young-people#:~:text=Sedentary%20lifestyle%2C%20overweight%20and%20obesity%2C%20smoking%2C%20heavy%20alcohol%20use%2C%20low%2Dfiber%2C%20high%2Dfat%20diets%20or%20diets%20high%20in%20processed%20meats%2C%20and%20other%20environmental%20factors%20have%20all%20been%20associated%20with%20the%20disease"&gt;processed foods, higher obesity rates, and other lifestyle factors&lt;/a&gt;. But this new study appears to add another suspect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers weren’t specifically looking to unravel this mystery; they were more interested in understanding why some parts of the world have higher reported rates of colorectal cancer than others. To do so, they analyzed the genetic signature of colorectal cancers taken from nearly 1,000 people across the world. These samples included people with both late and early onset cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colibactin is already known to cause mutations in our cells that could raise the risk of cancer, and past studies have linked it to colorectal cancer. But the researchers were surprised to find that colibactin-related mutations were about three times more commonly found in the early onset cancers they studied compared to the late onset cancers. They also found molecular evidence that these colibactin-related mutations tend to show up early in a tumor’s development, suggesting they play a vital role in fueling these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Coupled with other research showing that colibactin-related mutations often appear in the first ten years of life, the authors argue that this toxin could be a major instigator of early onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease,” said senior study author Ludmil Alexandrov, a researchers specializing in cancer genomics at UC San Diego, in a &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that colibactin may still only be one big piece of a larger puzzle. They note that colibactin-related mutations were rarely found in more rural parts of the world. So it’s possible that other environmental factors like diet or antibiotic use are encouraging the growth of colibactin-producing &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria in the gut in places like the U.S. Outside of colibactin, there might be other exposures that could explain higher cancer rates in different countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the team’s findings do provide fertile ground for future research, and could possibly even lead to interventions that could slow or reverse the rise in early onset colorectal cancer. The researchers are already hoping to study whether probiotics might be able to eliminate these more harmful &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;stains, and they’re trying to develop early detection tests that can screen for colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All of this work, however, is contingent on further funding. And the researchers are quick to note that the U.S. government under President Donald Trump has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/24/trump-100-days-nih-new-grants-cut/"&gt;aggressively limited funding&lt;/a&gt; from the National Institutes of Health in recent months—the same sort of funding that might go to important cancer research like theirs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If NIH funding cuts impact our ability to do this work, that will be, in my opinion, a substantial hit to cancer research not just in the U.S., but globally,” said Alexandrov. “Our funding has allowed us to collaborate with cancer researchers around the world, collecting and analyzing large datasets from patient samples in multiple countries.

Researchers tracked cognitive performance over seven years in more than 10,000 UK adults aged 50 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings challenge concerns that autistic individuals may face higher risks of cognitive decline or dementia. Instead, results suggest aging patterns in spatial memory are similar regardless of neurodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable Memory Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; Autistic traits did not predict faster decline in spatial working memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longitudinal Strength:&lt;/strong&gt; Cognitive ability remained stable over seven years for most participants, regardless of traits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample Size &amp;amp; Scope:&lt;/strong&gt; Study analyzed data from over 10,000 adults aged 50+, making it the largest of its kind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no difference over time in the spatial working memory of older people who have autistic traits and those who are neurotypical, finds a new study led by UCL researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, published in &lt;em&gt;The Gerontologist&lt;/em&gt;, is the first study to explore age-related rate of decline in spatial working memory in older people who may be autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109145"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older lady and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-aging-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Previous research has indicated that there may be higher dementia rates in older adults with autism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial working memory helps people to remember and use information about where things are and how they are arranged. It is typically used for tasks that involve navigating spaces or organising objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people get older, spatial working memory can sometimes become less effective, which is an example of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decline can be a part of normal aging, but it can also be more pronounced in conditions like Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial working memory can also be affected in autistic people – especially when it comes to tasks that involve remembering and organising visual information. Consequently, there has previously been debate over whether autism may lead to increased risk of cognitive decline and, by extension, future dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new study, the research team used data from 10,060 people over the age of 50 in the UK who had been assessed as having autistic traits – such as difficulty with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviours or interests – from the PROTECT study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that 1.5% of the cohort had high levels of autistic traits and may be autistic, which is comparable to prevalence estimates of autism in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analysed this data using a method called growth mixture modelling to see how participants’ spatial working memory changed over a seven-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the study showed that most people, whether they had high levels of autistic traits or not, maintained their cognitive ability over time. This suggested that autistic people were not more likely to experience cognitive decline in this domain.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corresponding author, Professor Joshua Stott (UCL Psychology &amp;amp; Language Sciences) said: “Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with differences in social communication and repetitive patterns of sensory motor behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is known that autistic people often also have cognitive differences relative to non-autistic people. In light of this and a current global World Health Organisation-led focus on prevention of cognitive decline and dementia, there has been considerable interest whether having a neurodevelopmental condition like autism can affect your risk of age-related cognitive decline, and potentially dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work provides no support for any difference between autistic people and neurotypical people in terms of increased risk of age related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there are limitations and more studies are needed, looking directly at other aspects of cognitive decline and dementia risk in community rather than healthcare records samples, this research provides useful evidence that can hopefully help to reassure autistic people about this concerning issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has indicated that there may be higher dementia rates in older adults with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these studies, which look at healthcare records, are hindered by the very low diagnostic rate of autism in older people (around one in nine adults over the age of 50 are diagnosed in the UK) meaning that they only look at a very particular and small subsample of autistic people, who probably have more healthcare difficulties and consequently are at greater risk of dementia than autistic people in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other studies that support the theory that autism has no extra effect on cognitive decline have previously only looked at whether autistic people differ in cognition from non-autistic (neurotypical) people at a single time point – rather than tracking changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author Dr Gavin Stewart, British Academy Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp;amp; Neuroscience at King’s College London, said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how ageing intersects with autism is an important yet understudied topic. Getting older often comes with a range of changes, including in health and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As autistic people can be at greater risk of certain health problems and have cognitive differences to non-autistic people, we need to know whether autistic people will have different patterns of ageing than their non-autistic peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides some reassuring evidence that some aspects of cognition change similarly in autistic and non-autistic populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies should test people for a longer time and include a wider age range to understand memory changes better. These findings also need to be replicated in samples who meet diagnostic criteria for autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported by the Dunhill Medical Trust, the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), Economic and Social Research Council (ERC), Alzheimer’s Research UK, and the British Academy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study only included people who could use a computer and the internet, so it might not represent all older adults in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the test for autistic traits mainly looked at social and communication issues, not other autism-related behaviours, which might affect the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And most participants were white, so the findings might not apply to people from other ethnic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ASD and cognitive aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#77075903181a15043702141b59161459021c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Poppy Tombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Poppy Tombs – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaf096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The association between autism spectrum traits and age-related spatial working memory decline: a large-scale longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;” by Joshua Stott et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gerontology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The association between autism spectrum traits and age-related spatial working memory decline: a large-scale longitudinal study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on mixed findings from previous research, researchers have hypothesised autism may be a protective or risk factor for age-related cognitive decline/dementia, or that autism does not influence it (parallel ageing). To differentiate between hypotheses, longitudinal studies that account for autism underdiagnosis, are needed and lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined if higher autistic traits in adults aged 50+ are associated with a greater risk of spatial working memory (SWM) decline, a key cognitive domain affected in both healthy aging and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Design and Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants from the online PROTECT cohort (n = 13,390) were classified into three groups based on autism spectrum traits (AST): high (H-AST, n = 205), intermediate (I-AST, n = 589), and no traits (COA, n = 12,451). SWM performance was captured annually across 7 years. Growth mixture models (GMM) and latent growth curve models (LGCMs) were estimated to examine the relationship between AST and SWM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GMMs revealed an optimal 1-class quadratic solution, consistent across groups. There were no significant differences between AST groups in baseline SWM (&lt;em&gt;p = 0.837)&lt;/em&gt;. AST were not associated with SWM at baseline &lt;em&gt;(B = 0.01, SE = 0.05, p = 0.901)&lt;/em&gt; or SWM trajectory &lt;em&gt;(B = 0.00, SE = 0.01, p = 0.856)&lt;/em&gt;, regardless of accounting for covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion and Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest a single SWM trajectory in middle-aged/older adults with higher autistic traits and no autistic traits. Future research should address if these broader autism phenotype results are replicated in diagnosed autism groups.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:54:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5NR0ViMkRYSEFjTTRhcWRnYndOTWUyOXFiOVZmZWZHYklVX2tQalhWT2hfTHdHTmw5ME9uMHZCUlRoU2VzUXJ5Z2FYdlN6Wk5mNTRwdy1YZ1dmakRoZWVWNHhZVWYzUQ</guid></item><item><title>你眼中的微妙线索可能意味着你会在45岁时患上痴呆症-每日邮报 | The subtle clue in your EYE that could mean you'll get dementia as young as 45 - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPM1dlOHByWWZ5Ylpkb2RTelUwUkRNRG5JbngtZW92dnpudHRPZ0lVd1RBWFlFRXY0bHlGcUNJR2dDeXg1Ty1UM1RyakM0QzVVX0ZHenFtdTRjdFFEUmd3ZDJPY0J0YXp1WjJYLUxURmIyREwtaV96UWJ3MTV3ejBKOFlYZk9xeUQ4RGVER0JqcmRjSnZjLXVZMVNDTGZVQmVCQ1Zr0gGoAUFVX3lxTE5ScVB5VmR1SjB6Zl9QY0NsWnBrU0NuUDljaUVhMW9ITlFNOFJkRENUVmp2RlJmYWc3LTl2NmJaaWtaSEIzdWJiQm9NaDFWMDh4T25saXBFUkVYaThnMDlOcG91cmtEOFRsbV9KVE04VEZyNFR3YkljRUhoRWZScUZaNUdHRTlQRjJZQkt5TU9KYXFxNWVGc0Y2LWRCVXp2YUhXTzdmNDNkNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blurry vision and seeing spots could means you're at high risk of developing early-onset dementia, researchers have discovered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_zealand/index.html" id="mol-414f5f30-21ea-11f0-9fa1-878caa005253"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; found that people were far more likely to be diagnosed with the disease in their 60s, 50s an even 40s if the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye was abnormally thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This problem is known medically as retinal thinning, and causes distorted vision which includes seeing spots, lines or flashing lights, as well as changes in colour perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia risk was also raised in those with signs of narrowing arteries and wider veins in the eye, which can cause pain or pressure as well as loss of vision in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from the University of Otago, suggested that both problems suggest insufficient blood flow to both the eye and the brain, which could contribute to the development of the memory robbing condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added that it could also be a sign of poor circulation throughout the body, which is also a known risk factor for the disease, as well as heart attack and stroke.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thorough eye examinations could therefore be a useful method of targetting those at risk of developing the disease, according to study author and psychology researcher Dr Ashleigh Barrett-Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early diagnosis is considered critical for better outcomes as dementia treatments can combat symptoms and slow down progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The the obscure clue in your eye that could reveal you will get dementia as young as 45-years-old  all comes down to your blood vessel health and the thickness of your retina, researches from New Zealand have said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, experts analysed data from participants of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, which recorded 45 years of health data from 900 New Zealanders with an average age of 45-years-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They combined photos and scans of participants’ retinas with cognitive tests designed to predict a person’s risk of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Assessments were carried out at birth and ages three, five, seven, nine, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26, 32, 38, and most recently at age 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed those with retinal thinning and poor eye blood vessel health were far more likely to show signs of cognitive decline aged 45 — often a precursor to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers advised that the imaging could be a simple and low-cost method of assessing dementia risk among middle-aged adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However they warned the test could only show potential risk and is not a definitive diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed a measles outbreak in the state Friday. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health said there are six confirmed measles cases in the state. The Centers for Disease Control defines an outbreak as occurring when a virus spreads among three or more individuals who share a connection with each other. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Health, there are two cases in the mid-Cumberland region and four in the upper Cumberland region. All six patients were unvaccinated, according to the department. Four patients are between 5 to 17 years old, one patient is between the ages of 18 and 49, and the final patient is over 50 years old, according to the Department of Health's data.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first case was confirmed on March 17. Three cases were confirmed between March 28 and March 31. The final two cases were confirmed on April 14. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are the first confirmed case of measles in the state since 2019, and it came amid multiple reported outbreaks across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Health, measles is a highly contagious viral infection that causes a red, blotchy rash. The virus usually affects babies and young children and can cause serious illness requiring hospitalization.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles usually occur between 7 and 14 days after infection. Those symptoms include rash, high fever, watery eyes, runny nose and dry cough. If you think you or your child was exposed or has symptoms, the Department of Health recommends isolating at home and contacting your healthcare provider.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to prevent measles is to be vaccinated with the MMR vaccine. Children should get their first dose between 12 and 15 months old. The second dose should be given between the ages of 4 and 6.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

In a diverse group of participants aged 19 to 86, they found an inverted U-shaped pattern: LC signal peaked in late middle age, then declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a strong LC signal after age 60 was tied to better cognitive performance, while sharper peaks were observed in women and Black participants—groups disproportionately affected by Alzheimer’s. These findings highlight the LC’s role in healthy aging and underscore the need for diverse research samples in brain health studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Spot Trajectory:&lt;/strong&gt; LC signal intensity peaks in late middle age, then declines with age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher LC signal after age 60 correlates with better cognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demographic Variation:&lt;/strong&gt; Black participants and women showed higher LC neuromelanin peaks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a demographically diverse sample of healthy people, Cornell researchers found dramatic changes over the human lifespan in the brain’s “blue spot” – a tiny region involved in cognition and believed to be the first affected by neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using specialized MRI scans to measure the intensity of neuromelanin, a pigment that gives the locus coeruleus (LC) its blue color, the research team observed an inverted U-shaped curve that peaked in later middle age before dropping off sharply, a finding that helps characterize healthy aging patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a stronger blue signal after age 60 was associated with better cognitive performance, according to the study involving 134 participants aged 19 to 86. Because of the participants’ diversity, including about 40% who were non-white, the researchers also discovered higher peaks among Black participants and women, groups known to be more susceptible to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By examining the health of the locus coeruleus and its relation to cognitive aging processes, these data may reveal when an individual is on a healthy aging trajectory and advance our understanding of why certain groups may have higher incidence of Alzheimer’s disease later in life,” said Adam Anderson, professor in the Department of Psychology and the College of Human Ecology (CHE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results showed underlying similarities in LC risk markers across the lifespan, but areas of specific concern for distinct demographic groups, especially for some that have been underrepresented in medical research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in “Age-related Differences in Locus Coeruleus Intensity Across a Demographically Diverse Sample,” published March 17 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurobiology of Aging&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cornell team included Anderson and Eve De Rosa, the Mibs Martin Follett Associate Professor in Human Ecology (CHE) and dean of faculty, who co-lead the Affect and Cognition Lab (ACLAB); Khena Swallow, associate professor in the Department of Psychology and the College of Arts and Sciences; and ACLAB members Elizabeth Riley, a research associate and the paper’s first author; Nicholas Cicero ’20; and Senegal Mabry, a doctoral student in the field of neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located deep in the brainstem, the locus coeruleus is the primary source of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter crucial for attention, memory, stress responses and even sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is thought to be the brain region most vulnerable to Alzheimer’s pathology, potentially affected years or decades before symptoms show. Thus, a better understanding of normal and abnormal LC aging trajectories is considered crucial to earlier detection of such diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans performed at the Cornell MRI Facility showed a consistent general pattern in healthy individuals’ LC signal intensity, regardless of education, income, and history of early trauma. Increased neuromelanin levels in midlife were associated with better cognition and decreases after age 60 with poorer cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing research is exploring ways to help sustain healthy levels, potentially through practices such as deep breathing or stimulation of the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the two subgroups showed more dramatic peaks in LC neuromelanin intensity is unclear, but the researchers said they are consistent with a theory of compensation: Overtaxing one’s brain and stressful living, which involves the LC, could be beneficial in the short term but deplete function later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the locus coeruleus is required for alertness, focus and memory,” Anderson said, “heightened neuromelanin can also be a sign of overactivity and is implicated in depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, all of which are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s racial and socioeconomic diversity – key to the findings’ overall generalizability and specific insights about subgroups – was achieved through a collaboration with the Community Recruitment Research Accelerator, a project of SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project seeks to increase diverse community participation in brain health research, partnering with a community recruitment liaison to reduce barriers to participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study illustrates the importance of diverse samples in studying brain health,” Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diverse samples are necessary to generalize study results to the larger population, and a critical form of scientific validity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cognitive aging and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2842494c1d1b1c684b475a464d4444064d4c5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;James Dean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;James Dean – Cornell University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2025.03.005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Age-related differences in locus coeruleus intensity across a demographically diverse sample&lt;/a&gt;” by Adam Anderson et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurobiology of Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-related differences in locus coeruleus intensity across a demographically diverse sample&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the trajectory of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; locus coeruleus (LC) signal intensity across the adult lifespan and among various demographic groups, particularly during middle age, may be crucial for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases, which begin in the LC decades before symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though pathological changes in the LC are thought to begin in middle age, its characteristics across the adult lifespan, and its consistency and variation across demographic groups, remain not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using T1-weighted turbo spin echo magnetic resonance (MRI) scans to characterize the LC, we measured LC signal intensity in 134 participants aged 19–86 years, with an effort to recruit a more racially diverse sample (41 % non-White).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LC signal intensity was lowest in early adulthood, peaked around age 60, and then decreased again in the oldest adults, particularly in the caudal portion of the LC, which exhibited the greatest overall signal intensity; education, income, and history of early trauma did not alter this general pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rostral LC signal intensity was further heightened in women and Black participants. In higher-performing older adults, increased rostral LC signal intensity was positively associated with higher fluid cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The potential accumulation of LC signal intensity across the adult lifespan and its possible dissipation in later life as well as its modification by demographic factors, may be associated with differential susceptibility to neurocognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:29:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1WMVM5aFoxeUFEODJoMjBObm9FYTJfVXo1YVQ1ZmFQQU9EVTFUMTAwcUt0c29CQ3VDVlVrdlhBaGlPT3V6RGkxZURVQUZJNmxNYnIyWEdSVDJUVFd0eGNfQTUtR0c</guid></item><item><title>减少异亮氨酸是延长33%寿命的关键- Earth.com | Reducing isoleucine is the key to a 33% longer life - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOTGVQREtBd3ZvUXo1QkZ3S09xNW1WUlc3LVZBaVVIRlZfaTd5WmJsYXdRWGVLRFRMOGE1cmx4TWVVY3VIVG8tTVpGaGlXT3huMmx6UWxNNjBPN1pTb1ZpNXp5c2g2b2x4c1Y3SmVIalNrMW5hMlNOaXVtMDViNDA4dW1GNTI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle-aged mice lived 33% longer when they cut back on one particular dietary building block. This finding has grabbed attention because it suggests a simple strategy that may support &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/leg-balance-is-a-key-indicator-of-healthy-aging/"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work comes from research teams who tracked how limiting the isoleucine in rodent meals boosted their longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach was led by metabolism researcher &lt;a href="https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/directory/lamming_dudley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dudley Lamming&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Wisconsin, US, and colleagues who also observed improved blood sugar control and leaner physiques among the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-isoleucine-s-role-in-healthy-aging"&gt;Isoleucine’s role in healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different components of your diet have value and impact beyond their function as a calorie, and we’ve been digging in on one component that many people may be eating too much of,” explained Lamming, who was involved in these mouse experiments, in 2023. Isoleucine is an essential part of our diet, yet some people consume too much of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much of this amino acid has been linked to unhealthy weight gain. The mix of amino acids in a person’s diet is now seen as an important factor in metabolic health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher intake of the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11185563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to increased body mass index in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-isoleucine-restriction-extends-lifespan"&gt;Isoleucine restriction extends lifespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male mice on reduced-isoleucine chow experienced lifespan increases of about a third. They also handled glucose better and stayed slimmer even while allowed to eat more total calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restricting isoleucine did not require complicated food measurements. It simply involved changing the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-model-esm3-creates-new-protein-that-simulates-500-million-years-of-biological-evolution/"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; proportions in their daily ration so that isoleucine was the limiting factor. The mice were allowed to eat freely, which makes the results even more surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-male-female-variation-in-isoleucine-restriction"&gt;Male-female variation in isoleucine restriction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, male mice showed a 33% boost in lifespan, while females only gained about 7%. This big gap raises questions about how sex hormones, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-metabolism-has-evolved-to-become-energetically-unique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, and body composition may influence how the body responds to amino acid changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have seen similar patterns before with other nutrient-based interventions. Hormonal differences can affect fat storage, muscle metabolism, and how energy is used, which may explain why the same diet creates different results depending on sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-gains-from-limiting-isoleucine-intake"&gt;Health gains from limiting isoleucine intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting and encouraging to think a dietary change could still make such a big difference,” said Lamming. Such results spark optimism for ways to support &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/experts-say-this-is-the-best-fruit-to-eat-for-a-healthier-liver/"&gt;healthier&lt;/a&gt; aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe that trimming isoleucine intake helps the body regulate insulin activity, which in turn aids energy balance and metabolic stability. The 2021 study in mice supports the idea that altered amino acid levels can reprogram liver function and fat storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-risks-and-rewards-of-isoleucine-reduction"&gt;Risks and rewards of isoleucine reduction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts note that isoleucine is one of three branched-chain amino acids needed for survival, so eliminating it is not an option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hemp-seeds-could-be-a-game-changer-as-an-alternative-protein-source/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Higher-protein foods&lt;/a&gt; like eggs, dairy, soy, and meats typically provide ample amounts of it, which can be troublesome for those at risk of excessive intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle adjustments must be approached carefully, because going too low in protein can also cause problems. “We can’t just switch everyone to a low-isoleucine diet,” Lamming said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-incorporating-isoleucine-limited-foods-into-daily-meals"&gt;Incorporating isoleucine-limited foods into daily meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who eat mostly &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meat-protein-boosts-survival-but-plants-boost-longevity/"&gt;animal-based foods&lt;/a&gt; may be getting more isoleucine than they realize. Meats, dairy, and eggs are especially rich in branched-chain amino acids, including isoleucine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping some of these foods for plant-based proteins – like beans, lentils, or tofu – could be a practical way to bring levels down without under-eating protein altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about extreme dieting. It’s more about tweaking food choices to reduce excess. Since isoleucine is just one of many amino acids, small shifts in dietary sources might be enough to improve long-term health without sacrificing nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-in-isoleucine-focused-research-and-treatment"&gt;Next steps in isoleucine-focused research and treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe more targeted changes, including drugs that block how the body processes isoleucine, may one day be explored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some observers hope physicians and dietitians might soon personalize amino acid profiles for specific health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short-term trial &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27346343/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; that low-protein diets can reduce weight and improve metabolic markers even without cutting overall calories. Such findings hint that translating the rodent results to human benefits is not far-fetched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-prospects-for-isoleucine-and-healthy-aging"&gt;Future prospects for isoleucine and healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many see this approach as a clue about the intricate links between diet and aging. These rodent models give reason to think that certain dietary tweaks could support longevity in people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators emphasize that fine-tuning is key. They plan to keep studying how these food-based strategies could be adapted into safe recommendations for adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any future guidance will need to balance nutrient needs, metabolic responses, and practical eating habits across different age groups and lifestyles.

A new study on psychedelic compounds might spark a deeper conversation about how the brain recovers from stress-related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used mice to investigate how a single dose of a psychedelic compound can support cognitive flexibility. The lead investigator, Dr. Omar J. Ahmed from the &lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/ojahmed.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, oversaw an experiment that tested how the animals responded to unexpected &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/psychedelics-sexuality-and-self-discovery-what-a-new-study-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-a-psychedelic-dose-rewires-the-brain"&gt;How a psychedelic dose rewires the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to reorganize and form new connections. Psychedelic drugs have shown promise in boosting these adaptive changes in certain parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has already &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671959/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hinted&lt;/a&gt; at benefits for people with depression and anxiety. This new investigation goes a step further by looking at how long these benefits last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts are exploring how &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1853/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;serotonin 2a receptor&lt;/a&gt; activation might reshape the way we learn. This receptor is linked to mood regulation and perception, so it makes sense that tweaking it could alter how the brain adapts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the investigators, only one dose was given to each mouse, with no additional treatments. Later, they ran tests that looked at how quickly the mice switched strategies under new conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists say the prefrontal cortex is key to tasks that demand judgment and quick &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/psychedelic-ibogaine-can-now-be-produced-without-rare-plants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;adaptation&lt;/a&gt;. Strengthening its connections may explain why a single dose can produce effects that last far beyond the initial exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-psychedelic-dose-boosts-flexible-thinking"&gt;One psychedelic dose boosts flexible thinking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What makes this discovery particularly significant is the sustained duration of cognitive benefits following just one psychedelic dose,” explained Professor Omar Ahmed. The researchers saw a clear advantage in how the psychedelic group tackled changing rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male and female mice both showed an uptick in mental adaptability. This broad effect indicates that the underlying mechanism could benefit a wide range of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A key question is what happens with two, three, or even twenty doses taken over several months,” said Dr. Ahmed. Investigators are curious about how repeated doses might affect flexibility in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such questions may guide the next phase of research. They might also help clarify whether more doses lead to better &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/increased-use-of-psilocybin-in-u-s-raises-health-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;outcomes&lt;/a&gt; or if there is a tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, not all psychedelics work the same way. Comparing substances with varying strengths and modes of action is essential to pinpoint which ones offer the most stable improvement in learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-mental-health"&gt;Implications for mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people who deal with mood disorders struggle to cope with shifting demands. A boost in flexible thinking could help them adapt more quickly to life’s uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapies that strengthen neuroplasticity show promise for conditions such as depression and PTSD. Psychedelics might become another avenue to support these neural changes, though more data from human studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6220878/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that psilocybin, a well-known psychedelic, has produced lasting improvements in mental well-being. Researchers note that this effect can persist for weeks, hinting at a mechanism that goes beyond a short-term shift in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most striking aspect of our findings is that these cognitive benefits were measured 15-20 days after a single psychedelic administration,” noted Elizabeth J. Brouns. Experts are also excited about the possibility of helping older adults or those with conditions tied to memory decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTSD, in particular, involves disrupted patterns of recall that can get stuck in negative loops. Breaking these loops might involve a shift in how the brain processes threats and rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-on-brain-healing"&gt;Future research on brain healing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/confirmed-magic-mushrooms-can-effectively-treat-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;knowledge&lt;/a&gt; about psychedelics might reshape how clinicians approach mental health. Some professionals predict that well-monitored psychedelic therapy could complement existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists plan to test different compounds, doses, and schedules to see what works best. They also want to confirm if these changes in flexibility come from changes in the prefrontal cortex or from other parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since studies point to stable neuroplasticity shifts after just one dose, the timeline for integrating these treatments may be shorter than previously thought. At the same time, caution is key because not everyone responds the same way to psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before new guidelines become mainstream, rigorous research is needed to cover safety and efficacy. Investigators remain optimistic that single-dose therapies could one day make a difference for a variety of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal frameworks around psychedelics are evolving in the United States. These changes might eventually open paths for more clinical trials that evaluate safety and practicality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings offer a fresh perspective on how one-time interventions may guide the future of mental health care.

He was prescribed antibiotics as well and soon after, his pain disappeared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, months later the pain came back and after multiple doctors were unable to find what was wrong, he decided to see a specialist. Tests concluded that he had muscle-invasive bladder cancer, where the tumour had grown into or through the muscle layer of the bladder wall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Given 2 years to live&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further scans showed that the cancer was at an advanced stage and he was given between a year and two years to live. After the shocking diagnosis, the father of two urged people not to dismiss early signs of the disease as an infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I went to the doctors, and explained what was going on, they took some urine samples and gave me some antibiotics. That seemed to work, it kind of went away for a while. A few months later, the pain came back, I did all sorts. I would drink cranberry juice, thinking that would flush through whatever was causing the pain, but that didn't have much of an effect," he recounted&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After doctors removed a 10cm tumour from his bladder, he was told that the cancer had spread to his pelvic lymph nodes and to a blood vessel near the bladder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Watch out for symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The oncologist said it was incurable. I asked what time frame we were looking at, it is a question that nobody wants to ask, and nobody wants to answer. She said that if we accept that the cancer is spreading, and other options don't work, I would be looking at 12 to 24 months. Our world changed overnight to a world of learning new things about cancer, hospital appointments and difficult conversations with family and friends," he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He urged people to be on the lookout for symptoms like his and to not ignore them. Bladder cancer symptoms include bood in urine, more frequent and painful urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, incontinence and abdominal pain. It is linked to smoking and is three times more likely to occur in men than women.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 14:30:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxPWWh0UWhkM0NjZ3VlR210d0xDajl1LWk2RmNXV2ViNEZjaFBJQkFVNjltX2xDVWdHSnVOb3QyWVdtdFdYekRzRGJyWHdGdjZCeWpwVlRlcVJkejNnM0NkZzA5VWNMV2NiSVpUUGRyc1hjNDk1dGdMYjVndEZncmZHdFA1MHU3UlBfYzFPR3QzTENuRGNlSE5hNmtYZXRzNGE3bWgwbkFoaG5JbnI0bmJqeDljd3hreDBWaW53bHJWSndMbFVfRVBnaV8wQnNQVkVZblJRSTUybVR4ZTdsbG5YQ3Rn</guid></item><item><title>新药为阿尔茨海默病患者带来希望和时间- KOMO | New drug gives hope and time to Alzheimer's patients - KOMO</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggJBVV95cUxPUEE4RlNWMVVBRk5TTXRqeWZzTHBPX3dhUzN2TUVjakJnUGlka05uMUcxQ2I5YXdnZTFETDJvc1dzbmx5eVVncXd3aEtoc3cwZVJQbGJGNTR3M3BkSUotSFRodWs0MW0yXzRzeXBBMUJ1ZmNiR2VySGZ5b0lyOGszcUZqVW5aVnY3ejNYOHJPQjh6MmtwdDdyOGRaUnltZjBNbTRSdTJrUnZoTTIzX0RmWTI2R3VkRUUwaVZ5cWswMFRvbkpWb05sUWFJVG1Mc1BSNFV5VlZCNHlKaWdiZmg3M3NYeGhVSUsxVFVVblJfSVQxbHlVVWk1c0lTM3FRSFl4Mnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SEATTLE — &lt;/span&gt;There's new hope for people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. A new medication called donanemab appears to slow memory loss, giving patients the gift of more time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UW Medicine's &lt;a href="https://depts.washington.edu/mbwc/" target="_blank" title="https://depts.washington.edu/mbwc/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Memory &amp;amp; Brain Wellness Center&lt;/a&gt; at Harborview Medical Center recently started treating patients with the drug. Bob Pringle is one of the first patients in Seattle to receive donanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They already tell me it won’t cure it. It won’t stop it," Pringle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not a cure, donanemab does have promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that I will progress with memory loss, and I’ve accepted that," Pringle said. "I’m just hoping that this process is going to slow that down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He already has issues with his memory. Pringle enjoyed a 30-year career with the Seattle Fire Department. While photos show him going from recruit to captain of the arson investigation team, he says he can't remember much about it. He hopes denanemab helps him hang onto the remaining memories of his family - his wife, two children, and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pringle will receive 18 infusions once a month for the next year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2807533" target="_blank" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2807533" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Donanemab is designed &lt;/a&gt;to teach his immune system to remove proteins from his brain that lead to dementia. It could extend his quality of life by months, buying time while science works towards a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have a disease-modifying treatment that can interfere with the biology of Alzheimer's disease and lead to a better outcome in the patient’s eyes," said Dr. Thomas Grabowski, medical director of the Memory and Brain Wellness Center. "There’s a sense of hopefulness that this medicine has brought with it. And that’s gratifying to be part of that. We’ve worked many years to get to this point, and to be able to honestly say we have the first effective treatment for this disease is really a good feeling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donanemab works similarly to lecanemab, &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/local-study-prevent-alzheimers-disease-help-family-medicine-health-seattle-washington-science-lecanemab-medication-beard-university-of-washington-ahead-study-brain#" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/local-study-prevent-alzheimers-disease-help-family-medicine-health-seattle-washington-science-lecanemab-medication-beard-university-of-washington-ahead-study-brain#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;another promising Alzheimer's drug.&lt;/a&gt; Patients on lecanemab need infusions every two weeks, while donanemab is administered once a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between his infusions, Bob and his wife Tina have plans to go on a cruise, making new memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still travel," Tina said. "And he’s able to. I have to take more of the responsibility, of course, but I’m happy to do so. So as long as he can keep enjoying life, that’s the goal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a big goal - wrapped in a small pouch of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That’s hope in that little tiny bag," Tina said.

A new study reveals that only children experience greater emotional and financial stress when caring for aging parents, and support from friends or extended family doesn’t offer the same relief it does for those with siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of shared family history and emotional backup can make caregiving more isolating for only children. Researchers emphasize the importance of early, honest conversations between parents and their adult children to set expectations and ease the emotional burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Burden:&lt;/strong&gt; Only children face more emotional and financial strain when caregiving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Help from friends doesn’t provide the same relief as sibling support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Trend:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of single-child families in the U.S. has doubled in recent decades.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caring for an aging parent is one of life’s most meaningful — and challenging — experiences. For adults who grew up as only children, that task often comes without support. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No siblings to share the stress, split costs or take turns during long nights — just one person carrying the entire load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s a growing issue. Single-child families are becoming more common in the United States, increasing from about 10% to 20% in recent decades. This means more aging parents will be relying on just one adult child for care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109129"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc.jpg" alt="This shows an adult daughter and dad." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;One is that only children often have especially close bonds with their parents and may rely on them for emotional support. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, research from the University of Missouri confirms what many adult only children have long felt: Caregiving is hard — and it’s even harder when you’re doing it alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, Hana Skoblow and Megan Gilligan from Mizzou’s College of Education and Human Development analyzed national data from 1,773 adults caring for aging parents. Of those, 12% were only children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that caregiving stress looks different depending on whether someone has siblings, and adult only children were more likely to face emotional and financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study also showed that while support from friends or extended family often improves mental health for caregivers with siblings, it doesn’t have the same effect for only children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Families with multiple kids can lean on each other for help,” Skoblow, a postdoctoral fellow and lead author, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But only children don’t necessarily have that built-in support system. Even when they receive help from friends or extended family, it doesn’t seem to provide the same relief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact reason isn’t clear, Skoblow and Gilligan offer a few possible explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is that only children often have especially close bonds with their parents and may rely on them for emotional support. When a parent begins to need care, that emotional safety net can vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that only children may struggle to share their challenges, especially when the person they normally confided in is now the one they’re caring for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of siblings means there’s no one else who shares the family history or truly understands the emotional dynamics,” Skoblow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That can make the experience feel even more isolating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Skoblow acknowledges sibling tension is not unusual when caring for a parent, particularly when one sibling feels like they’re doing more than their fair share, the current study was limited to comparing only children to those with siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start the conversation early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Skoblow and Gilligan stress the importance of starting conversations about caregiving sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adult children and their parents may each have ideas about what caregiving should look like,” Gilligan, an associate professor in human development and family science, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they don’t talk about it ahead of time, those expectations might not line up, and that can make a hard situation even harder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being open about what everyone wants, and what they can realistically offer, can make the experience smoother and strengthen the relationship in the process, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The parents’ perspective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers want to flip the script by asking parents how they feel about being cared for by their only child. It’s part of Skoblow and Gilligan’s future research to understand more about how different family structures, care distributions and emotional responses are related to the experiences of both adult children and their parents — regardless of family structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do they feel guilty? Do they try not to ask for help? Are they worried about being a burden?” Gilligan said. “We want to better understand both sides of the relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f4c4b5e51515a7f52564c4c504a4d56115a5b4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Stann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://missouri.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eric Stann – University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaf006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stressors and Resources Among Adult Child Caregivers in the Presence or Absence of Siblings&lt;/a&gt;” by Hana Skoblow et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gerontologist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stressors and Resources Among Adult Child Caregivers in the Presence or Absence of Siblings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent attention has focused on understanding later-life caregiving networks, emphasizing how multiple adult children within the same family navigate parental care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, families with one child are increasingly common, and we know little about how adult only children experience caregiving and whether their experiences differ from those with siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this study assessed differences in caregiving experiences between adult child caregivers with and without siblings and whether associations between caregiving experiences and mental health (i.e., psychological well-being and distress) vary by sibling presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Design and Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used cross-sectional data from 1,773 adult child caregivers (12% without siblings; &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 56.75 [9.23]) in the National Health and Aging Trends Study and National Study of Caregiving. We conducted &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; tests and a series of multivariate regressions with interactions to test hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adult only child caregivers reported more financial difficulty with care than respondents with siblings. The negative association between emotional difficulty of care and psychological well-being was stronger among adult children without siblings. Informal support was positively associated with psychological well-being only for adult children with siblings, although this may be accounted for by race and ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion and Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that adult only children may be at elevated risks of the financial difficulties and the emotional consequences of parental care provision. Further, informal support may be less protective for adult only children’s well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the increasing prevalence of single-child families, more research is needed to better understand and support adult only children caring for parents.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 14:21:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5QZUlBcExNODZtblo1U0JVMXpRRGFGcFNMaWhmcVdvbUJVV001U19pWlo1MjNGdXFYUWF5WmV2cU9TNjJuSTE1NFhNekp2Rzd5bDk4YnE4Q2plekZxV3hSNktmaTFLQzhvSlVGMU1UWXpsSWN1U1E</guid></item><item><title>神经重新布线可能是精神病恢复的关键-神经科学新闻 | Neural Rewiring May Hold the Key to Psychosis Recovery - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1GclhtTFpTenBKc3NTTE1KeVVPejBoMERGR3gzMUMtVS1IaS1kNF85LUNrc3BaTEtJQ0RSaWkwdWdOSkcySVE3VmRMbEw4YWtRWkp6LWotcXNFT0V2UV96bVlLOVJNalhWcXpSbXNGMFBrS1MxUV91WXN3cGJuQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study has uncovered the brain connectivity patterns that differentiate patients who recover from psychosis from those who do not. Using whole-brain computational models, researchers found that patients in remission show increased neural connectivity, while those with persistent symptoms show reduced connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups exhibited lower overall neural stability than healthy individuals, but only recovering patients adapted their connectivity in a way that supports recovery. This refined understanding may allow clinicians to predict the course of psychosis and tailor treatments accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Psychosis remission is associated with increased brain connectivity, while persistence is linked to decreased connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Modeling:&lt;/strong&gt; Computational models can now help predict individual patient outcomes based on brain scans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision Medicine:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital brain twins could test the effects of treatments before application, personalizing care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UPF Barcelona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study led by Pompeu Fabra University reveals which brain mechanisms allow psychosis to remit. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this pioneering research could have important clinical implications for exploring new intervention strategies in patients with psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was carried out in collaboration with one of the main psychiatry groups at Lausanne University Hospital (Switzerland).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109125"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Thus, the differences between the neural connectivity patterns of people whose psychosis has remitted and subjects with persistent symptoms were explored. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examines differences in the neural connectivity patterns of patients who have recovered from psychosis and subjects who have not. Identifying these differences using computational models has enabled determining which patterns of neural connectivity facilitate the remission of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the research have recently been published in an article in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its principal author is Ludovica Mana, a doctor and neuroscientist of the Computational Neuroscience group at the UPF Center for Brain and Cognition (CBC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main co-investigators are Gustavo Deco and Manel-Vila Vidal, director and researcher with the same research group, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study focuses on psychosis, the serious mental disorder that causes abnormal, disconnected ideas and perceptions of reality, the main symptoms of which are delusions or hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Spain, psychosis affects 1.2% of the population, according to&lt;a href="https://www.sanidad.gob.es/estadEstudios/estadisticas/estadisticas/estMinisterio/SIAP/Salud_mental_datos.pdf"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;data from the Spanish Ministry of Health (2020). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the world, it is estimated that between 1.5 and 3.5% of the population may be diagnosed with psychosis during their lifetime (Calabrese and Al Khalili, 2023).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analysed the MRI brain scans of 88 patients at Lausanne Hospital in the early stages of psychosis and 128 healthy individuals (control group). Thus, the differences between the neural connectivity patterns of people whose psychosis has remitted and subjects with persistent symptoms were explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Neural connectivity increases when psychosis remits and decreases when the opposite is true&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this comparative analysis, significant differences have been found in the activity of the brain network of the two patient groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, they present opposite connectivity patterns: the neural connectivity of patients with persistent symptoms of psychosis decreases, while it increases among people with remitting psychotic episodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using whole-brain computational models, the study found that both groups have lower overall stability of neuronal connections than healthy patients. The changes undergone by neuronal connections could be due to the brain’s need to adapt to a situation of poor conductivity, caused by psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, among recovering patients, changes in the pattern of neural connectivity contribute more widely and effectively to the remission of the disease. This would explain the empirical and clinical differences of the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Refined computational methods enable predicting a patient’s natural evolution after their first psychotic episodes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustavo Deco (UPF) points out that this study “allows us to predict a patient’s natural evolution after their first psychotic episodes”, thanks to the “refinement” of the computational models of the whole brain that allow us mechanistically to analyse its functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, “these whole-brain models are the best and only example of a genuine implementation of precision medicine from digital brain twins”, he states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, these models were limited to explaining the mechanisms underlying different brain states, that of psychosis, for instance, which was very useful in the first phase. But, now in the second phase, they allow reproducing the individualized brain mechanisms of specific patients, in the line of so-called precision medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, they are not only capable of explaining the state of the brain at a specific time, but also of beginning to predict its temporal evolution or even its evolution based on the effect of different pharmacological or electromagnetic treatments that can be tested first using computational models”, Deco explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludovica Mana (UPF) adds: “This study highlights the need to challenge ourselves and change our outlook: first, going beyond broad diagnostic categories to better understand the diversity of patient experiences, and second, recognizing that computational methods, when carefully combined with clinical knowledge, can really help us further our understanding of mental disorders”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study could have important clinical implications for exploring new intervention strategies in patients with psychosis, hence the need to continue advancing in this line of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bad3c8dfd4df94cadfd3c8d5facfcadc94dfdecf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Irene Peiró&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://upf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UPF Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Irene Peiró – UPF Barcelona&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00394-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subgroup-specific brain connectivity alterations in early stages of psychosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Ludovica Mana et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subgroup-specific brain connectivity alterations in early stages of psychosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional brain scans have shown that connectivity alterations are strongly associated with the first episode of psychosis, yet it is not well understood whether these alterations vary with the clinical status of patients at the time of scanning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study aimed to identify brain connectivity properties that differentiate remitting and non-remitting early psychosis (EP) patients from healthy controls and to explore the mechanisms underlying these differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this end, we analyzed resting-state fMRI and DSI data from 88 EP patients categorized by their remission ability after the first episode of psychosis. We focused on differences between stage III remitting–relapsing (EP3R) and stage III non-remitting (EP3NR) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposing functional connectivity (FC) alterations were observed: EP3NR patients exhibited lower FC compared with controls, while EP3R patients showed higher FC, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-brain network modeling revealed lower local stability affecting the ability to regulate the flow of stimuli across the network in stage III patients, particularly in EP3R, which may indicate an adaptation to impaired network conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight subgroup-specific brain alterations and underscore the importance of considering this source of heterogeneity in psychosis research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:55:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1GclhtTFpTenBKc3NTTE1KeVVPejBoMERGR3gzMUMtVS1IaS1kNF85LUNrc3BaTEtJQ0RSaWkwdWdOSkcySVE3VmRMbEw4YWtRWkp6LWotcXNFT0V2UV96bVlLOVJNalhWcXpSbXNGMFBrS1MxUV91WXN3cGJuQQ</guid></item><item><title>由于其独特的饮食习惯，新国家可能成为蓝区-每日邮报 | New country emerges as possible Blue Zone thanks to its unique diet - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxNeHlteW9WVFJDb0Ixa1h2RnBXckUzdThucEFCSldUNk9WaGJ2aEVJQmlLZ2hBSTBxR3VNMzNMLWNucjJnYmNIVHlab0lXU3pPVEl2NEtFMV9SV2lzQ2ZBSGpxbUVqdllIcnROWGY0VGpMT2pyT09Sbnk5eUVLVlU4bXdmOUpRbjZsbUZrX2Fnd1RJYmhKNTRTbFBVQ3hrWTMwdEdwV241eUtxeElyV2t5elcySGVWUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mediterranean diet has long been hailed as the healthiest way to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emphasizing lean fish, leafy green vegetables and healthy fats like avocado and olive oil, the diet has roots dating back to ancient &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/greece/index.html" id="mol-1bd85750-213d-11f0-96ca-f5628efc8e80" class=""&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and Rome, which are now dubbed Blue Zones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blue Zones are places lauded as longevity hotspots with low rates of chronic disease and significant amounts of people living well into their 90s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the Mediterranean diet has &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/wellness-us/article-12938849/weight-loss-2024-calorie-counting.html"&gt;earned the title of healthiest fare year after year&lt;/a&gt;, the cuisine a nation in Africa could soon take its place.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/the-netherlands/index.html" id="mol-cbafa750-2142-11f0-96ca-f5628efc8e80" class=""&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; researchers earlier this month found people in Tanzania, which sits on the southeastern edge of Africa bordering Kenya, are far healthier than western nations due to a focus on unprocessed, traditional foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Tanzanian Kilimanjaro diet, named after the volcano Mount Kilimanjaro, focuses on foods like okra, plantains and beans, and drinks like mbege, made with fermented banana and the grain millet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found men who followed the Kilimanjaro diet had significantly lower levels of inflammation and stronger immune systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts behind the study believe it's the diet's lack of processed food that keeps inflammation at bay, lowering the risk of chronic diseases and possibly extending lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tanzania's traditional diet focuses on unprocessed, natural foods like vegetables, legumes and grains.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study highlights the benefits of these traditional food products for inflammation and metabolic processes in the body,' said Dr. Quirijn de Mast, lead &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03602-0"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;author and infectious disease specialist at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the same time, we show how harmful an unhealthy Western diet can be.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers recruited 77 healthy Tanzanian men with an average age of 25.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, 23 men who normally followed the Kilimanjaro diet were asked to switch to a typical western diet for two weeks, which included foods like processed sausages, white bread and fries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, 22 who typically ate western meals followed the Kilimanjaro plan for two weeks. This included eating corn, okra, plantains, kidney beans and avocados. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another 22 on the western diet also were asked to drink one serving of mbege every day for a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five men who maintained their normal diets were used as controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found people who switched from the Kilimanjaro to the western diet had higher levels of inflammatory proteins in their blood. Their immune cells were also less effective in warding off pathogens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors said the western diet showed 'systemic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Blue Zones' are places lauded as longevity hotspots with low rates of chronic diseases and significant amounts of people living well into their 90s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dietitians recommend snacking on fruit to take advantage of the Kilimanjaro diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who switched to the Kilimanjaro eating plan, however, saw the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The changes to inflammation levels were still detectable via blood samples for four weeks after the study ended, suggesting the Tanzanian diet had long-lasting benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Inflammation is at the root of many chronic conditions, which makes this study highly relevant for Western countries as well,' Dr. de Mast said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, while this diet seems to have similar effects as the one that came out of the Mediterranean, Tanzania itself is not considered a Blue Zone. &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-9807859/US-life-expectancy-falls-WWII-77-3-amid-COVID-19-pandemic-CDC-report-finds.html" class=""&gt;The average life expectancy is 67 - in the US, it is 77.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Greece and Italy - two countries that adhere to the Mediterranean diet - have an average life expectancy of 82 and 84 years old, respectively. They are each home to one of the world's five Blue Zones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, Tanzania had a cancer rate of 140 cases per 100,000 people in 2022, significantly lower than 445 per 100,000 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tanzania records about 44,000 cancer cases per year compared to roughly 2 million in the US, though Tanzania has a significantly smaller population - there are roughly 66 million people in Tanzania compared to 330 million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both countries have roughly equal diabetes rates, with one in 10 adults being diagnosed with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sapna Peruvemba, a dietitian at Health by Sapna, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://vegnews.com/tanzania-kilimanjaro-style-diet"&gt;VegNews&lt;/a&gt; those who want to follow the Tanzanian diet should focus on building meals around vegetables, fruits and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet plan also includes fermented foods like sauerkraut and kimchi, which have probiotics that have been shown to promote the production of disease-fighting antibodies and anti-inflammatory compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Peruvemba says, 'Don’t underestimate the power of returning to the basics.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:49:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxNeHlteW9WVFJDb0Ixa1h2RnBXckUzdThucEFCSldUNk9WaGJ2aEVJQmlLZ2hBSTBxR3VNMzNMLWNucjJnYmNIVHlab0lXU3pPVEl2NEtFMV9SV2lzQ2ZBSGpxbUVqdllIcnROWGY0VGpMT2pyT09Sbnk5eUVLVlU4bXdmOUpRbjZsbUZrX2Fnd1RJYmhKNTRTbFBVQ3hrWTMwdEdwV241eUtxeElyV2t5elcySGVWUQ</guid></item><item><title>早期Ocrevus治疗可减少MS小脑萎缩-今日多发性硬化症新闻 | Earlier Ocrevus treatment may reduce cerebellar shrinkage in MS - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPMmdjS1JrZG5ON0pWbTRWeW9idERrSTdZLVQ0LWpLN2pJU2FKMlE4Rmt6d25TQXRoZnZLeWpDNFE2Qy1VUEdlZGpsYnBIM01OcjJRQ2d4a0kxNFRkQlZoR0M5NFJ6ejNXOWVtckJUSllWVWV5Tm9WR3prTVdEbGQ4YlJXajlIN0dJUUtNZkJyWi1mb2VTdTZMSG5FZ1N4UEVwZDNLRGJFOUVGQUxRQ0NkZGRNcjlRb1RsTlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early treatment with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ocrevus-ocrelizumab-primary-progressive-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Ocrevus&lt;/a&gt; (ocrelizumab) may help protect the cerebellum, a region of the brain that plays a key role in motor coordination, cognitive function, and emotional regulation, from damage in people with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), a study suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from the clinical studies that supported Ocrevus’ approval showed that patients with relapsing &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/"&gt;forms of MS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms/"&gt;primary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt; (PPMS) who began the medication earlier experienced significantly less cerebellar volume loss than those who first received a control treatment or a placebo and started the therapy only in the trials’ open-label extension portions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These differences were maintained in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/13524585251325086"&gt;Short- and long-term effects of early versus delayed treatment with ocrelizumab on cerebellar volume loss in patients with RMS and PPMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in the &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis Journal. &lt;/em&gt;The research was funded by Roche, the parent company of Ocrevus’ developer &lt;a href="https://www.gene.com/"&gt;Genentech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS is a neurological disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin sheath&lt;/a&gt;, a fatty coating around nerve fibers that facilitates the communication between nerve cells. This causes regions of damage, which are seen in MRI scans as lesions, and leads to nerve cell death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Ocrevus treatment trials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When nerve cells and neural connections are lost, the brain and its structures shrink faster than what’s typical with aging. Brain atrophy, or shrinkage, is often used to monitor the degree of neurodegeneration in MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum is increasingly recognized as one of the brain regions affected in all stages of MS, with patients experiencing faster rates of cerebellar volume loss compared with healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study suggested that Ocrevus, an antibody that aims to deplete B-cells, key drivers of MS inflammation, may help to reduce cerebellar volume loss in people with relapsing forms of MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, an international team of researchers examined data from the three Phase 3 trials that formed the basis for the approvals of Ocrevus — &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01247324"&gt;OPERA I (NCT01247324)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01412333"&gt;OPERA II (NCT01412333)&lt;/a&gt; for relapsing forms of MS, and &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01194570"&gt;ORATORIO (NCT01194570)&lt;/a&gt; for PPMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OPERA trials enrolled more than 1,600 patients who were randomly assigned to receive Ocrevus or &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/rebif/"&gt;Rebif&lt;/a&gt; (interferon beta-1a) for 96 weeks (nearly two years) and then entered an open-label extension, in which all are receiving long-term Ocrevus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ORATORIO study enrolled 732 participants who received either Ocrevus or a placebo for at least 120 weeks, or about 2.3 years, after which most also entered an open-label extension portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All extensions are ongoing. At the time the data for this analysis was gathered, patients from the OPERA trials had been receiving Ocrevus for up to eight years and those from ORATORIO for up to 7.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both trials and their extensions, MRI scans were used to monitor cerebellar and overall brain volume at multiple time points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results showed that patients with relapsing forms of MS who received Ocrevus in the OPERA trials had 30% less reduction in cerebellar volume after 96 weeks compared with those treated with Rebif in the main trials. Patients in both groups experienced similar rates of cerebellar volume atrophy in the open-label portion, meaning that the differences observed at the end of the main trials were kept until the end of the follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the PPMS group, the initial difference in cerebellar atrophy between Ocrevus and the placebo was lower, at 16%, at the end of the ORATORIO trial and reaching up to 22% during the open-label extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, patients who eventually transitioned to Ocrevus in the extension started to experience similar cerebellar atrophy at a similar rate as those who had always been on Ocrevus, so the greater early cerebellar volume loss was never reversed after switching.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Volume loss in PPMS vs relapsing MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebellar volume loss in the extension portions occurred almost twice as fast in PPMS (a reduction of 0.30% per year) compared with relapsing MS (0.18% per year), despite similar initial cerebellar volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers attributed this accelerated decline to continuous and slow inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes that result in faster irreversible tissue loss. In contrast, relapsing forms of MS are primarily driven by acute inflammatory activity, which responds more effectively to therapies like Ocrevus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team found that a greater cerebellar volume at the start of the OPERA trials was linked with better initial scores on certain clinical measures, such as disability levels, dexterity, and walking ability. Such correlations were not observed in the ORATORIO trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no evidence that initial cerebellar volumes could predict the likelihood of confirmed disability progression in patients with either relapsing forms of MS or PPMS, meaning there’s no “clear evidence to support the routine measurement of cerebellar volume in patients receiving anti-CD20 therapies,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our results show that ocrelizumab helps preserve cerebellar volume and its integrity when treatment is started earlier,” the researchers wrote, adding that more studies are needed to understand how changes in cerebellar atrophy correlate with long-term clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

Participants with all three habits showed elevated depression symptoms, higher metabolic risk, and lower self-rated health and wellbeing scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects were even more pronounced in those who maintained unhealthy habits over the long term. The researchers stress the importance of adopting healthy behaviors early in life to avoid compounded health risks later on, though even midlife changes can offer benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Unhealthy habits already harm physical and mental health by age 36.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cumulative Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Long-term engagement in smoking, drinking, and inactivity worsens health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavior-Specific Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking primarily affects mental health, inactivity impacts physical health, and drinking negatively affects both.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Taylor and Francis Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad habits such as smoking, heavy drinking and lack of exercise must be tackled as early as possible to boost the odds of a happy and healthy old age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the message of a new peer-reviewed study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (Elevate), that found smoking and other vices are associated with declines in health in people as young as 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact is even greater when these bad habits are indulged in over the long-term, state experts whose study tracked the mental and physical health of hundreds of people for more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has followed people from middle-age, typically for around 20 years.  Studies to-date have shown that smoking and other aspects of a healthy lifestyle are adapted before the age of 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in this new study a research team from Finland wanted to track people from a younger age – and to unpick, at the same time, the effect of unhealthy habits on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a long-running longitudinal study, in which hundreds of children who were born in the Finnish city of Jyväskylä in 1959 were followed from childhood until their early 60s, the team analyzed participants’ mental and physical health via data that was collected from surveys and medicals when they were 27 years old (326 participants) and again at age 36, 42, 50 and 61 (206 participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health was assessed via surveys on symptoms of depression and on psychological wellbeing. Physical health was assessed by creating a metabolic risk score based on blood pressure, waist size and levels of blood sugar, cholesterol and other blood fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-health was assessed by asking the participants to rate the state of their health over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three risky behaviours were also assessed at each point in time: smoking, heavy drinking (defined as consuming at least 7,000g/875 units of alcohol a year for women and 10,000g/1,250 units a year for men) and physical inactivity (exercising less than once a week).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the results showed that if an individual had all three unhealthy habits – they smoked, drank heavily and were inactive – at a given point in time, their mental and physical health were poorer than if they didn’t have any of these risky behaviours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms rose by 0.1 points, metabolic risk score rose by 0.53 points, psychological wellbeing fell by 0.1 point and self-rated health fell by 0.45 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms and psychological wellbeing was measured on a scale of 1-4; self-rated health was measured on a scale of 1-5; and metabolic risk was scored from 0-5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having all three unhealthy behaviours long-term was even more strongly associated with poor health.  Depressive symptoms rose by 0.38 points, metabolic risk score rose by 1.49 points, psychological wellbeing fell by 0.14 points and self-rated health fell by 0.45 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of exercise was particularly linked to poor physical health, smoking was mainly linked to poor mental health and heavy alcohol consumption was associated with declines in both mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the effects were apparent by the time the participants were in their mid-30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer cause almost three-quarters of deaths worldwide,” says lead author Dr Tiia Kekäläinen, a health scientist who has a particular interest in aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But by following a healthy lifestyle, an individual can cut their risk of developing these illnesses and reduce their odds of an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the importance of tackling risky health behaviours, such as smoking, heavy drinking and physical inactivity, as early as possible to prevent the damage they do to from building up over the years, culminating in poor mental and physical health later in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, it is never too late to change to healthier habits. Adopting healthier habits in midlife also has benefits for older age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that the study was observational and so couldn’t establish that the risky behaviours were fuelling ill health, rather than vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say that the relationship is likely two-way.  For example, someone who is stressed may drink heavily to help them cope.  This could then cause problems with family and friends that lead to poorer mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They add that the results are likely to apply to people born in Finland and other Western countries in late 1950s and in the 1960s.  However, they may not be as relevant to younger generations, owing to cultural and societal changes, and partly different risky behaviors occurring nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s limitations include rating each of the three habits as being equally damaging to health, instead of weighting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also acknowledge that they only looked at three types of behaviour and say that other factors, such as diet, should be included in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1162787c7e7f3f667462627e7f5165707f75773f727e3f647a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Simon Wesson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tandf.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Taylor and Francis Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Simon Wesson – Taylor and Francis Group&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2025.2479233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cumulative associations between health behaviours, mental well-being, and health over 30 years&lt;/a&gt;” by Tiia Kekäläinen et al. &lt;em&gt;Annals of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cumulative associations between health behaviours, mental well-being, and health over 30 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e326"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the number of risky health behaviours and the duration of exposure to these behaviours over time may increase the risk of later adverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined cumulative associations of risky health behaviours with both positive and negative aspects of mental well-being and health. It has a uniquely long follow-up period of over 30 years, from early adulthood to the beginning of late adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e329"&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data were from the Jyväskylä Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development. The participants represent the Finnish age cohort born in 1959. This study utilized data collected at ages 27 (1986), 36 (1995), 42 (2001), 50 (2009), and 61 (2020–2021) (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 206–326).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk scores indicating the current number of risky behaviours of smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity and their temporal accumulation over time were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The associations of risk scores with mental well-being (depressive symptoms, psychological well-being) and health (self-rated health, number of metabolic risk factors) from age 36 onwards were analyzed with linear multilevel models adjusted for gender and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e336"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;More current risky behaviours were associated with more depressive symptoms (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = 0.10, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.032), lower psychological well-being (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = -0.10, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.010), lower self-rated health (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = -0.45, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and more metabolic risk factors (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = 0.53, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.013).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The associations of temporal risk scores with the outcomes were even stronger (depressive symptoms: &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = 0.38, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; psychological well-being: &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = -0.15, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.046; self-rated health: &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = -0.82, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; metabolic risk factors: &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = 1.49, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among individual behaviours, the temporal risk score of alcohol consumption was negatively associated with most outcomes, while smoking was associated with poorer mental well-being and physical inactivity with poorer health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e390"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current and temporal accumulation of multiple risky health behaviours were associated with poorer mental well-being and health. Preventing these behaviours early in adulthood and midlife is crucial to avoid their accumulation and subsequent health risks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:25:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5yOFA4Rm9yRjhZTFd5T0o1RHhXT3FuMzk1NExhYW9HOFJ1aWJYVUg3alhBRVlhU1FXSUh2YkFuR0NSTTU5ZUF1QVgybmdvcnN4YW8yMFZ6el84V1hmSkFrSmcybEdfOTQ3R1dCeFlQT0tCbXVU</guid></item><item><title>首批西雅图患者接受新的早期阿尔茨海默氏症药物-《西雅图时报》 | First Seattle patients receive new early Alzheimer’s drug - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPeFotZzExQ1htaVF6OV9KRkJlWlMwTWFlX0pnTlVQUGJLU2UtSFVLamZ3cEt5UUFxdEk1ckxKdnpWTmRLbFE3c1hLNzliWmFTeURmUW5jaVlzdDMxZllLNkFUd1BkSVBmaXc0ZWJCdG5lZXRTVkhOOFNhS2FpTDhKSlI2b0lLTjFBTXU0ZjlJV0ZYU1RBdUFqcmh1MURHWVNtb0VnSFdQbWVhUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPeFotZzExQ1htaVF6OV9KRkJlWlMwTWFlX0pnTlVQUGJLU2UtSFVLamZ3cEt5UUFxdEk1ckxKdnpWTmRLbFE3c1hLNzliWmFTeURmUW5jaVlzdDMxZllLNkFUd1BkSVBmaXc0ZWJCdG5lZXRTVkhOOFNhS2FpTDhKSlI2b0lLTjFBTXU0ZjlJV0ZYU1RBdUFqcmh1MURHWVNtb0VnSFdQbWVhUQ?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;First Seattle patients receive new early Alzheimer’s drug&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggJBVV95cUxPUEE4RlNWMVVBRk5TTXRqeWZzTHBPX3dhUzN2TUVjakJnUGlka05uMUcxQ2I5YXdnZTFETDJvc1dzbmx5eVVncXd3aEtoc3cwZVJQbGJGNTR3M3BkSUotSFRodWs0MW0yXzRzeXBBMUJ1ZmNiR2VySGZ5b0lyOGszcUZqVW5aVnY3ejNYOHJPQjh6MmtwdDdyOGRaUnltZjBNbTRSdTJrUnZoTTIzX0RmWTI2R3VkRUUwaVZ5cWswMFRvbkpWb05sUWFJVG1Mc1BSNFV5VlZCNHlKaWdiZmg3M3NYeGhVSUsxVFVVblJfSVQxbHlVVWk1c0lTM3FRSFl4Mnc?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;New drug gives hope and time to Alzheimer's patients&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;KOMO&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNbDhib3liRzVlVFZ0eW1TWkw0UlFSWWJrMVg3cUF2Sm8xUjVEcnBkamFnejc5X3ZweGsyLXFqUlhBNEtZS0NHY1g4ZG1CZThFYkVlMTlYRkhrNjY2dEJ0d2VGMUpUd3Vhd2dmMEI5NXR2SEF1UGgzM21SeWM3d25qSWJlWEtqRk9SMGRnSHhZNjVhRnJhM3YwUnBwQ0ZNdVpabjl2MGRyTlY?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;New treatments infuse hope for slowing Alzheimer’s progression&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;MercyOne&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTFB6TER3NWg5NGdzM2FlU0ZkZWluSm1tMGZ5NlNkTzUtdDNyb003dXpuZUZLeDM4ODNnWXhRODU3SW1JSGlPXzB5Q055OVZtbUVkc0FmRlZXc1I4SDlqQnRv?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;The future of Alzheimer’s treatment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Nature&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQSWZZTjJOM3JLQVR6SHNMV3JLYWxxNlZ2NjlEQVhhaU1DbzJwemtYNkRvdE5XNmQzQ0I5bld4aF85S0h1ZFNVdVNOUkJ2YXZjeGpMRlpMVUV6NkFSbl93MWMxZUZVX2xqcU10SHVYSUFPR0JHd2laaFRyNnI5M1pBMjNIMWZrU0JHQm9pdEQ4bVhwLUJOM2c?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Presentation of Alzheimer’s Disease in Clinical Practice&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Neurology live&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPeFotZzExQ1htaVF6OV9KRkJlWlMwTWFlX0pnTlVQUGJLU2UtSFVLamZ3cEt5UUFxdEk1ckxKdnpWTmRLbFE3c1hLNzliWmFTeURmUW5jaVlzdDMxZllLNkFUd1BkSVBmaXc0ZWJCdG5lZXRTVkhOOFNhS2FpTDhKSlI2b0lLTjFBTXU0ZjlJV0ZYU1RBdUFqcmh1MURHWVNtb0VnSFdQbWVhUQ</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，为了肠道健康，您应该吃的排名第一的碳水化合物- EatingWell | The #1 Carb You Should Eat for Gut Health, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFB1bjhFblBWLUE3NTQ0QXNRX0M5ZURPZEdEazJUa0VhQzJlMzR0eXRSVzhUXzl2YmZ4Z2ZqRDBYeWV5VGduU2NTVV9lTW4wOWFnaTRha0I4bTlDSzlqbURCZWg1STY4eG1YVnotVA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbs often get a bad rap, but not all carbs are created equal. Yes, some may leave you feeling sluggish, spike your blood sugar or bring on digestive woes. However, others can do wonders for your body, especially your gut. “Gut health is key to feeling your best,” says &lt;a href="https://eatswimwin.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Katie Schimmelpfenning, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and founder of Eat Swim Win. “A balanced gut helps keep your mood steady by regulating hormones and supports your immune system to fight off illness.  And, let’s face it, no one wants to walk around feeling bloated or uncomfortable.” 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you’re looking for a carb that’s been proven to do good things for your digestive health, dietitians recommend chickpeas. Yes, chickpeas! Those small yet mighty legumes aren’t just a fantastic base for hummus or a protein-rich addition to your salad. They’re packed with gut-health benefits that deserve a round of applause.

It plays a crucial role in keeping your digestive system healthy by regulating bowel movements and supporting the growth of good gut bacteria. Just one half-cup of cooked chickpeas provides 6 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Since most of us don’t get enough fiber to begin with, that’s good news for digestive health, says &lt;a href="http://thedietitiandish.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and founder of Dietitian Dish, LLC.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, chickpeas contain two different types of fiber—soluble fiber and insoluble fiber—which each work in different ways to promote gut health, she says. For instance, soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like substance, which helps to slow digestion and support the absorption of nutrients. On the other hand, insoluble fiber adds bulk to stool, aiding in its passage through the digestive system to prevent constipation. This dual action contributes to a balanced gut environment and improves overall digestive efficiency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Chickpeas are rich in resistant starch, which helps feed the good bacteria in the gut and boost the production of short-chain fatty acids,” says &lt;a href="http://www.whollynourished.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jaime Bachtell-Shelbert, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Wholly Nourished. If you’ve never heard of resistant starch or short-chain fatty acids before, we’ll explain. Resistant starch is a special type of fiber known as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prebiotic fiber&lt;/a&gt;. After we eat chickpeas, their resistant starch travels intact to the colon. When it gets there, your good gut bacteria ferment it for food, helping to promote their growth and activity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During this process, your good gut bacteria produce beneficial compounds called short-chain fatty acids, which nourish your gut lining to keep it strong and healthy and protect against disease-causing inflammation. Research has found that SCFAs may also help reduce the risk of colon cancer. If that weren’t enough, SCFAs additionally foster communication between your brain and your gut, so they may support emotional well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chickpeas’ gut-health benefits aren’t just about their fiber. These powerful legumes also contain antioxidants called phenolic acids that promote gut health in several ways. For instance, research has found that phenolic compounds may reduce inflammation that can trigger &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ibs-symptoms-8654975" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&lt;/a&gt; symptoms and may play a role in the onset of inflammatory bowel disease.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hard-working phenolics also tighten gaps in the gut membrane, forming a tight seal that locks out disease-causing bacteria. And, like fiber, phenolic compounds promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.

The researchers also looked at the relationship between the daily averages and how likely the participants were to develop 13 types of cancer that are linked with physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After about six years, 2,633 people in the study had been diagnosed with one of those 13 types of cancer. But the researchers discovered that people with the highest amount of daily physical activity had a 26 percent lower risk of developing cancer than those who had the lowest amount of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with higher daily step counts also had a lower risk of cancer, regardless of how fast they moved while being physically active. Those who took 7,000 steps a day had an 11 percent lower cancer risk compared to people who took 5,000 steps, while people who took 9,000 steps daily had a 16 percent lower risk. (After 9,000 steps, the risk decrease leveled off.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of exercise were people doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t spell out &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a42803758/beginner-workout-plan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:what type of exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;what type of exercise&lt;/a&gt; the participants did. Instead, they looked at how intensely and how much participants moved on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people who did light- and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity every day had a lower risk of developing cancer compared to those who were more sedentary. But a range of movements can fall into that category, from walking and doing daily chores, to going for runs and doing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30985585/hiit-workout-at-home/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HIIT workouts.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;HIIT workouts. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/daily-physical-activity-even-light-intensities-linked-lower-cancer-risk#:~:text=In%20a%20prospective%20cohort%20study,cancer%20than%20individuals%20who%20were" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:suggest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that people who aren’t that physically active can lower their cancer risk by incorporating more walking into their day, at any pace. “What’s especially promising is that this benefit wasn’t limited to intense exercise,” says &lt;a href="https://cph.osu.edu/people/benzo3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Roberto M.

(Inflammation is &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/conditions/inflammation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tied;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tied&lt;/a&gt; to a slew of serious health conditions, including cancer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular movement also enhances the immune system, helping to improve the body’s ability to detect and destroy abnormal cells,” says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/amy-k-bremner" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Bremner, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amy Bremner, MD&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of breast surgical oncology at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if you’d prefer to have a step count goal to reach for, the study found that logging 9,000 steps a day was best for cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best ways to lower cancer risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say it’s really important to consider what’s in your control when it comes to cancer risk. “You can’t control your genes, but some lifestyle factors will reduce your risk,” Dr. Jacoub says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends these lifestyle moves to tamp down on your risk of developing cancer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be active on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat a diet that’s lower in red meat and high in antioxidant-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t smoke or stop smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit how much alcohol you drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to limit your levels of stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay socially connected to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Jacoub says that staying physically active is “unquestionably” important in lowering your cancer risk.

We need better tools to identify early which patients are at the highest risk of recurrence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies of relatively rare diseases, like pediatric cancers, can be challenged by limited data. This study, which was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, leveraged institutional partnerships across the country to collect nearly 4,000 MR scans from 715 pediatric patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maximize what AI could “learn” from a patient’s brain scans — and more accurately predict recurrence — the researchers employed a technique called temporal learning, which trains the model to synthesize findings from multiple brain scans taken over the course of several months post-surgery.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, AI models for medical imaging are trained to draw conclusions from single scans; with temporal learning, which has not previously been used for medical imaging AI research, images acquired over time inform the algorithm’s prediction of cancer recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To develop the temporal learning model, the researchers first trained the model to sequence a patient’s post-surgery MR scans in chronological order so that the model could learn to recognize subtle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the researchers fine-tuned the model to correctly associate changes with subsequent cancer recurrence, where appropriate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the researchers found that the temporal learning model predicted recurrence of either low- or high-grade glioma by one-year post-treatment, with an accuracy of 75-89 percent — substantially better than the accuracy associated with predictions based on single images, which they found to be roughly 50 percent (no better than chance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providing the AI with images from more timepoints post-treatment increased the model’s prediction accuracy, but only four to six images were required before this improvement plateaued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers caution that further validation across additional settings is necessary prior to clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, they hope to launch clinical trials to see if AI-informed risk predictions can result in improvements to care — whether by reducing imaging frequency for the lowest-risk patients or by preemptively treating high-risk patients with targeted adjuvant therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have shown that AI is capable of effectively analyzing and making predictions from multiple images, not just single scans,” said first author Divyanshu Tak, MS, of the AIM Program at Mass General Brigham and the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This technique may be applied in many settings where patients get serial, longitudinal imaging, and we’re excited to see what this project will inspire.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to Kann and Tak, Mass General Brigham authors include Biniam A.

As a result, almost all children undergo frequent, long-term, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain surveillance regardless of individual recurrence risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal deep-learning analysis of serial MRI scans may be an effective approach for improving individualized recurrence prediction in gliomas and other cancers, but, thus far, progress has been limited by data availability and current machine-learning approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a self-supervised temporal deep-learning approach tailored for longitudinal medical imaging analysis, wherein a multistep model encodes patients’ serial MRI scans and is trained to classify the correct chronological order as a pretext task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pretrained model is then fine-tuned to predict the primary end point of interest — in this case, 1-year recurrence prediction for pediatric gliomas from the point of last scan — by leveraging a patient’s historical postoperative surveillance scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We apply the model across 3994 scans from 715 patients followed at three separate institutions in the setting of pediatric low- and high-grade gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal imaging analysis with temporal learning improved recurrence prediction performance (F1 score) by up to 58.5% (range, 6.6 to 58.5%) compared with traditional approaches across datasets, with performance improvements in both low- and high-grade gliomas and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of (range, 75 to 89%) across all datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurrence prediction performance increased incrementally with the number of historical scans available per patient, reaching plateaus between three and six scans, depending on the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temporal deep learning enables high-performing longitudinal medical imaging analysis and point-of-care decision support for pediatric brain tumors.

In experiments where participants watched video clips of people about to shift their gaze, viewers responded faster when the gaze was self-directed rather than instructed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that eye movements contain subtle cues about intention, which we’re wired to recognize instantly.

It has been theorized that this has led our brains to develop a heightened ability to focus on social cues from faces, and especially from eyes,&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; said Jelena Ristic, a Professor in McGill’s psychology department. She has been working in the field for over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a system that has evolved to support very quick exchanges of complex social information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gaze-following is thought to provide a foundation for our social development and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It helps us to understand what others are thinking, looking or wanting, as well as to connect with them mentally, so we follow where others are looking quickly and spontaneously. Even young human infants and primates do it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Able to glean intentions by looking at eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ristic is the senior author on a research paper describing a series of seemingly simple experiments in which participants viewed videos in which people on screen looked either right or left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the subjects on screen had been instructed to look in one direction or the other, and other times they were allowed to choose where to look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos were paused just before the subjects moved their eyes, and the observers were asked to predict the direction that the subjects were going to look next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that when the people on screen were free to choose the direction of their gaze – what the researchers called “intentional looks” – the observers’ rate of accuracy was not affected. However, those who predicted correctly were able to do so more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the observers were able to glean intentions in the eyes before any action had taken place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The speed of the observers’ responses suggests that they implicitly recognize and respond more quickly to intentional eye movements. It also told us how sensitive we are to information about the mental state and intentions conveyed by the eyes,” said Florence Mayrand, a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychology and the paper’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics of eye movements may provide clues about intentions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To try to understand why observers were able to guess eye-shift direction more quickly when people on screen had been left free to choose the direction in which they would look, the researchers analyzed the amount of motion available in the eye movement video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More movement was found in the area near the eyes right before the gaze shift when the gazers could choose freely where to look than when they had been told which way to look. This suggested to the investigators that intentional looks are marked by specific movement patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further understand whether intentional looks have any special physical properties to which people are inherently sensitive, the researchers are currently measuring the speed, trajectory, duration and the number of blinks and blink characteristics for intentional and directed looks in a new sample of study participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this, they plan to examine whether these fundamental properties differ according to the intentions of the person looking in one direction or the other, for example, whether they are intending to deceive or help; how the ability to read intentions from eye gaze develops; what its underlying brain mechanisms are; and whether there any differences in sensitivity to intentions in gaze for groups with social difficulties, such as adults or children with autism or ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada (SSHRC), Natural Science and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC) and McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5c373d2834392e353239723b33313e3d251c313f3b353030723f3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katherine Gombay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katherine Gombay – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-024-00137-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Intentional looks facilitate faster responding in observers&lt;/a&gt;” by Florence Mayrand et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intentional looks facilitate faster responding in observers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans construct rich representations of other people’s mental states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated how intentionality in eye gaze affected perception and responses to gaze. Observers viewed videos of human gazers looking left or right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the observers, the gazers could either choose where to look (self-chosen gaze) or were explicitly instructed where to look (computer-instructed gaze).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1, observers reported the direction of the gazer’s upcoming look before the eye movement was initiated. Faster responses were found for self-chosen relative to computer-instructed gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiments 2 and 3, observers responded by reporting the location of a peripheral target that appeared at the gazed-at or not gazed-at location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faster responses were found for gazed-at relative to not gazed-at targets and at longer cue-target intervals for self-chosen relative to computer-instructed gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The examination of the eye movement kinematics indicated that self-chosen gaze shifts were marked by a larger magnitude of motion within the eye region prior to the eye movement occurring relative to computer-instructed ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, perceived intentionality in eye gaze facilitates responses in observers with the information about mental states communicated via subtle properties of eye motion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 12:24:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBjaEVUczMxMUNDU2p3QS1ORlB1MEc4ZXd2R3UyUVExRUdvVnNvR1Z6YU9jQmJTbEhHLUo2d2pMNDIzVjZvSF85MlZVRVBxV2JNRk1Cb1ZEc0ZQVVJSb3JiaDRCTzVydjVKeUJXVDhLbVhuZw</guid></item><item><title>我是一名心脏病专家……以下是女性不应忽视的心脏病发作的微妙迹象--《每日邮报》 | I'm a cardiologist... here are the subtle signs of a heart attack women should NEVER ignore - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPREEzRGtRUzU3bE5QU2RrZmI5dWlSWnRpUk4wYUdfS2hPblEtRXVBZERPWEJYalZ0UVlNLV9EZEJmNjFEM19KdVdCbHJRWE4wSXBQNnlSS2VHRks4dzFCLWZKVVhpbjlQTWdSbWcxZUhOblR2YkZtd2Y1TUF4YlNpWGgxWl80WERMNW4tczlfdTNNRWFrSTNkampyTmEzSmtKOEZr0gGoAUFVX3lxTFB5MFg2LXhhUmYxZ2pZeFB0OW8xam5SVW5tV2gweEliRnRJSGlWZ3dGTWp4bm5sQ1F4d0FZYzQ0cHdmUDBPYnZ1QU11allYZXBxZG5FamlLVnByVTEtSnZIM0Z2ZXpjRmUwZ3JzTTF0WXVBQ3czMUlvMGltT0Rac1FTSlJnOFctS293MmhlbjNOTGtfN0xzU1BlNzBUaUJqN2MxOG5QdU5jZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether it was from school, TV, or that scene in Four Weddings and a Funeral, you're probably well-versed in the symptoms of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You know the ones: pain in your left arm and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Or so you thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because a lot of what we know about science and health are based on the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/methods/standards.html"&gt;bodies of white, able-bodied men&lt;/a&gt;, often anyone who doesn't fit this description is left out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And this includes women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So because you've been conditioned to recognize the symptoms of a man, you probably wouldn't recognize if you were having a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, interventional cardiologist and chief medical officer at Vital Solution Dr. Bradley Serwer told DailyMail.com that women don't even always have chest pain when they're having a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Instead, they may experience shortness of breath, nausea, indigestion, or upper abdominal pain, dizziness or passing out,' Dr. Serwer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Women don't always experience a pain in their chest when they're having a heart attack (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it's because of this difference in symptoms that a diagnosis can be delayed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can have fatal repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Though heart disease remains the leading cause of death for women in the United States, they tend to present with it seven to 10 years later in life compared to men,' Dr. Serwer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Due to the under recognition of heart disease in women, studies have indicated that they receive less aggressive treatment.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what other heart attack symptoms are women potentially missing out on? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Serwer said that jaw pain can be an indication, especially if they commence during moderate exercise and then subside when you rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He also said that pain primarily located on the left side of the jaw, especially when accompanied by the absence of redness or swelling in the jaw, can be a signal that your pain is being caused by something more severe than you thought. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the idea that a shooting pain is a sign you're having a heart attack isn't totally off. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Because women's heart attack symptoms are less recognized, they often get less aggressive treatment than men do (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you feel pain in your neck and arm - any arm - this could be the symptom of a heart attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if you're having any sort of shortness of breath, perspiration, or clammy skin followed by pain, you might want to get to a doctor immediately. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The pain should be taken more seriously if you have significant cardiac risk factors, such as a smoking history, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or a strong family history of coronary artery disease,' Dr. Serwer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether you've experienced this symptoms before or they're showing up out of nowhere, it's always better to be safe than sorry - especially when it comes to your heart.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford University researchers report that ciprofloxacin use drives persistent antibiotic resistance in human gut bacteria, with resistance emerging independently across diverse species and enduring for over 10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health concern linked to millions of deaths each year. It is widely driven by excessive and inappropriate antibiotic use. Past efforts to study AMR have largely relied on in vitro experiments and animal models, which fall short in replicating the full complexity of human microbial environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study titled "Brief antibiotic use drives &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+gut+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; towards low-cost resistance," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08781-x" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, researchers performed a longitudinal metagenomic study to explain how resistance evolves in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy adults&lt;/a&gt; received ciprofloxacin, 500 mg twice daily, for five days. Over a 20-week period, participants collected 16 stool samples, yielding 960 samples for analysis. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on all samples, generating an average of 18.8 million reads per sample. A computational tool named PolyPanner was developed to identify true polymorphic sites across time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers reconstructed 5,665 genomes representing commensal bacterial populations and identified 2.3 million genetic variants. Among these, 513 populations exhibited selective sweeps, clear evidence of adaptive evolution. A high concentration of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mutations/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mutations&lt;/a&gt; occurred in gyrA, a gene associated with fluoroquinolone resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Among the 513 evolving populations, sweeping genetic changes frequently occurred in gyrA, a gene central to fluoroquinolone resistance. Sixty-three populations across 34 participants exhibited gyrA mutations, which typically arose independently within individuals. Nearly 10% of initially susceptible bacterial populations acquired resistance through these mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once established, gyrA sweeps persisted beyond 10 weeks and were predicted to remain detectable for up to a year. Additional resistance-associated mutations occurred in other genes, though these events were less common and appeared in fewer species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance was more likely to emerge in populations that were abundant before treatment and experienced significant declines during exposure, identifying a condition correlated with higher odds of evolutionary change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistance mutations did not come with fitness costs, allowing resistant strains to retain a dominant population after treatment concluded. Targeted sequencing showed no evidence of resistance reversion. Mutations in gyrA accounted for only part of the observed resistance, suggesting additional mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the results, even short-term antibiotic use can lead to resistance mutations that persist in the human gut for months after treatment ends. Mutations arise independently across &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bacterial+species/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bacterial species&lt;/a&gt; and do not incur a measurable fitness cost, allowing resistant strains to remain prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Gut microbes proved capable of evolving resistance without prior infection. Commensal populations may therefore act as reservoirs for resistance traits that could transfer to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pathogenic+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pathogenic bacteria&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/horizontal+gene+transfer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;horizontal gene transfer&lt;/a&gt; beyond the interaction with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because resistance evolved predictably based on population size, it allows for the possibility of predicting resistance outcomes if the starting population is known in advance of treatment. Experiments with differing admixes of starting populations and treatment types are needed to fully expand this predictive modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring microbial composition and abundance before and during &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/treatment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; could help guide more precise antibiotic use, reduce long-term risks associated with resistance and improve overall stewardship of antibiotic use.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists have been studying creatine since the 1830s and, for more than a century, we have known that it was pivotal for producing energy in our muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That, as anybody who was alive in the ’90s may remember, is how creatine first exploded as a consumer product. Swedish researchers &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1327657/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; influential research in 1992 demonstrating creatine supplementation’s effectiveness in improving stamina and recovery during the short bursts of physical exercise. It didn’t take long after that for creatine supplements to hit the shelves of drugstores and workout gyms nationwide. And it was popular. Not only was it cheap — a 10-ounce jar of creatine costs $17 on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NUTRITION-Micronized-Creatine-Monohydrate-Unflavored/dp/B002DYIZEE?th=1"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; — but it was also an easy way for bodybuilders and exercise enthusiasts to improve their performance. Today, as many as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8401943/"&gt;one in four adults&lt;/a&gt; say they have used creatine; &lt;a href="https://www.sportsmedtoday.com/creatine-va-206.htm#:~:text=Creatine%20is%20the%20most%20popular,11th%20and%2012th%20graders%20athletes."&gt;$400 million worth of it&lt;/a&gt; is sold in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And this was a supplement that really worked: A 2018 meta-analysis of the available research concluded that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6090881/"&gt;creatine is “the most effective nutritional supplement&lt;/a&gt; available to athletes to increase high intensity exercise capacity and muscle mass during training.” Across years of studies, no dangerous side effects have been detected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the most surprising use of creatine supplements is in a setting that could not be further from the image of jacked-up bodybuilders pumping iron: treating depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the early 2000s, scientists established creatine’s importance not only for muscle use but also for brain function. The compound &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3340488/"&gt;helps&lt;/a&gt; your brain to convert nutrients into energy and scientists concluded that poor metabolism could help to explain various psychiatric disorders, including depression. In layman’s terms, if your brain wasn’t processing energy efficiently, it could have these negative side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If that were true, it would follow that more creatine could improve a person’s brain metabolism and thereby ease their depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A decade ago, the first clinical trials began testing whether creatine supplements improved depression among people who were also receiving antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy. The results have been impressive: A 2024 meta-review concluded that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11567172/"&gt;creatine had proven its effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; in supplementing those other treatments, leading people to feel better more quickly and be less likely to experience depression again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now comes a new study, out of India, suggesting creatine could be helpful in treating depression without antidepressants being involved — a preliminary but potentially important finding as we search for cheaper and easier ways to provide help to more people who need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="a-fascinating-new-creatine-depression-study-in-india" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;A fascinating new creatine depression study in India&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X24007405?via%3Dihub#sec0002"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, was tiny and flew under the radar: 100 participants, in Dehradun, a city of 800,000 in India’s far north. Lead researcher Nima Norbu Sherpa of Glasgow Caledonian University received a grant from an India-based charity, the Universal Human Rights and Social Development Association, to run the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The setting is telling: Part of creatine’s appeal in mental health treatment is not only its potential efficacy but also that it’s cheap and doesn’t require a professional clinician; patients can take it on their own. That made Dehradun, a developing city with a lot of low-income patients and relatively few mental health clinicians, a logical place to test whether creatine could improve people’s well-being without antidepressants, said Riccardo De Giorgi, a clinical lecturer in psychiatry at Oxford and co-author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The 100 participants, recruited from the city and small surrounding villages, were split into two groups. Both groups took part in talk therapy sessions. One group also received 5 milligrams of creatine every day, while the other got a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After eight weeks, both groups were improving — cognitive behavioral therapy itself is, of course, a well-attested treatment for depression. But the patients who took creatine on top of their therapy were doing better still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The participants answered a nine-question survey at the beginning of the study, which provided a one-number score of the severity of their depression symptoms. People in both groups started a little below 18 on average, indicating moderately severe depression. At the end of the study, the patients taking creatine reported a score of 5 on average, while the control group registered at 11. Eleven people who were taking creatine throughout the study reported going into remission, meaning they could effectively return to normal life; only five people taking placebos said the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Both groups had about 20 people discontinue their treatment — not uncommon for people with depression, the authors noted. The reported side effects for people taking creatine were mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It is an eye-catching result, even as De Giorgi emphasized repeatedly that the findings were “incremental and preliminary.” The inevitably sensational nature of the finding — a bodybuilder supplement can help with depression? — warrants being clear and cautious in how we interpret the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Previous sensationalist messages in this research area, e.g., creatine, physical exercise, keto diet, have caused more harm to the science than benefit,’” De Giorgi told me over email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For one, the high dropout rate is reason for skepticism about the precise size of creatine’s effect. More research that replicates the same results is needed before we can be confident that creatine plus therapy is a winning combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But it’s an area of research worth watching. Peter Attia, a physician who writes about longevity and health enhancement and was not involved with the study, &lt;a href="https://peterattiamd.com/creatine-and-depression/?utm_source=weekly-newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=250406-NL-/creatineanddepression&amp;amp;utm_content=250406-NL-/creatineanddepression-email-subs&amp;amp;utm_source=Peter+Attia&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fa3017be8a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_01_18_12_06_COPY_01&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-d5206691b8-106237662&amp;amp;mc_cid=fa3017be8a"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in covering the study’s findings that “since many people already use creatine as part of their supplement routine, it could be an easy addition for those looking to improve mental health without major lifestyle changes.” Its affordability and ubiquity could also make it appealing for people with fewer resources, like those who participated in the India study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He did, however, also caution that more evidence would be necessary before we can figure out whether and how creatine fits into “the therapeutic toolbox.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As we grapple with &lt;a href="https://www.projecthope.org/news-stories/story/the-global-mental-health-crisis-10-numbers-to-note/"&gt;a global mental health crisis&lt;/a&gt;, we need all of the tools we can find.

If we really have an alternative as cheap and available as creatine, it could make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNa0V2QkZKRzdPaG1qcHhwd1czM0E1VFJMQ0JrLTl6ODJsMXFpZnk1M2dlZ1VYdEdLRjIyT2VBblJiLVdRR1JQSkRiRlFwQ3Z3YnU0MUhwcmo1dnFFelR5V2xTSWVnUktDQ19aSmoyUTBBa1FTNUJEWC11UVJnRC1ENU9DWVJvX1ZKU1N0SGZkVHZhaHgweTdrd3ZzVQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚发现了降低癌症风险的最佳步骤-而且比你想象的要低-女性健康 | Scientists Just Discovered The Best Step Count For Slashing Cancer Risk—And It's Lower Than You Think - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQa2p0cHlZc0hSTmlEMU1YZWJRVUU0TVNsbGlCeW9ZOXB2ZTNkcVFmNDNybHVfSWRmcGtpR2lqZlNWSFJ0SUpRV1VyektuQTBrZFRtd3QtUEgtTnZ5MVFqMG1VVFU3cXdyOWd6YTV1XzRvVG5MbF9qaWxFVS1DRHk5cGs0cFlSMEhBXzZzTmIxbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;You can’t do a thing about the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19133613/23andme-breast-cancer-test/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19133613/23andme-breast-cancer-test/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="genes" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt; you inherit from your parents, but doctors have stressed for decades that there are &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63785689/yogurt-colorectal-cancer-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63785689/yogurt-colorectal-cancer-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="certain lifestyle tweaks" data-node-id="0.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;certain lifestyle tweaks&lt;/a&gt; you can make to help lower your risk of developing cancer.

Kennedy Jr’s recent comments about autism have reignited debates on the topic, with the US Health Secretary labelling the disorder an ‘epidemic’ with a greater impact than Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He’s far from the first person to use such terminology to describe what is happening with autism diagnoses and, actually, he’s not entirely wrong about the scale of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he is wrong about what’s truly driving skyrocketing numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since 1998, there has been a 787 per cent increase in autism diagnoses in the UK. There &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; an epidemic – not of autism itself, but of positive diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-91b6c3b0-21d5-11f0-b6f3-29522c2df646"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; estimates one in 31 children now has autism compared to one in 56 a decade ago. Previous studies suggested prevalence was as low as one in 5,000 in the 1960s and 1970s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr has suggested previously that the rise in autism is linked to vaccines. The real question we should be asking is not what the cause of the disorder is but, instead, what is contributing to out-of-control diagnosis rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2025, many organisations are reporting diagnosis rates well above 80 per cent, meaning that for every ten people who walk through the clinic door, eight get a diagnosis. This raises serious concerns, as not everyone can have autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr has called autism an 'epidemic' and blamed the rise in diagnoses on vaccines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism isn’t suddenly more prevalent because more people are being born with it, or because we have ‘greater awareness’ of the symptoms – it’s mostly down to a dramatic rise in misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This has been fuelled by multiple factors, such as the use of unreliable online methods to diagnose and a distressed society that is struggling to cope without diagnosis or labelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We also see the erroneous application of genuine clinical concepts such as ‘autistic masking’. This is a strategy used by people with autism to cover up or camouflage the communication difficulties they experience, helping them ‘fit in’. For instance, people with autism may pretend to be ‘normal' in social situations – by reducing their fidgeting, not revealing their intense interests, or rehearsing what they will say, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We are seeing this characteristic being misused to justify giving diagnoses to people who do not have symptoms of autism – but who, for example, might be socially awkward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another factor in the rise of diagnosis rates is that assessments are being carried out by people without the necessary qualifications and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psychiatrists, paediatricians and psychologists are trained to complete diagnostic work, holding doctoral-level qualifications and working under statutory professional regulation to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet we are increasingly seeing other practitioners giving diagnoses – cognitive behavioural therapists, teachers, assistant psychologists and social workers – who are simply not qualified to perform these assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Lisa Williams is a clinical psychologist and founder of The Autism Service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism diagnosis has become a lucrative commercial opportunity, thanks to many people looking to explain their difficulties via diagnosis. The NHS is now outsourcing millions of pounds worth of assessments per year to the private sector, with many providers prioritising profit over quality. (With an absence of complaint – because too often the diagnosis sought is the diagnosis gained.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism is very real, but the system designed to support those with the disorder is buckling under the sheer number of people receiving a diagnosis, diverting care from those the service was ring-fenced for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What is needed is better gatekeeping of referrals, not more diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Globally, there needs to be a shift in focus, away from outdated questions about causes and cures, and instead towards addressing the urgent problem of misdiagnosis, the integrity of diagnostic practices, and society’s requirement for labels for everything we experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long-term, the consequences of this could prove catastrophic for autistic people who rely on the support systems that are likely to collapse if action is not taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Lisa Williams is a clinical psychologist and founder of The Autism Service, a network of private clinics in England and Wales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 10:45:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPdlBNTGRXRDZPOGprNkpJVUNXZ2lJbUFLSnBLU3hRX1paMWc3TnlKQ3RPREkySjdmd2lRN09ZVTdWWTVaZVM3Tjc3MUpDOWtpOVQ5VlFWM242OGZteGpQMkRkZTJKdWt2QUlubGhwU193LUx2dE1waTd0d2hEWW5rdXllS1NoNjhRdk9fWjlIYWRnOXVUTVd0bVNYMzRGZVdQNFNzaVBZOWhLYmVZRnFfMDhB</guid></item><item><title>肠道细菌的损伤可能在年轻人结肠癌的增加中发挥作用- NPR | Damage from gut bacteria may play a role in the rise in colon cancer in young adults - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxONVZNZ00ydk9yVFBwZHBFNHg4dDJUYldEZDFMdFVzZHdEVlpEZDFTT0JwOWRVdHB4a1RnTlFMVmhUajFRZWVfUWlYWDRVbXVrTFltRGFmU01kc2drQVpqYnY4SlNwajBybEszT2RxUnpfZnRfdlNYSENLVm12aVpxMk9lX0J1N0JZc1ltNGVLUWZiTGJ0SkxFaDNyeDhFWVZJd3ZuT1NINWE5NFFFblE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Escherichia coli or E. coli is a part of family of bacteria that are commonly found in the human gut. Scientists found that a toxin the bacteria release is linked to some cases of colorectal cancer.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear why colon cancer cases &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;have doubled&lt;/a&gt; in people under 55 over the past two decades, a staggering rise that has alarmed doctors and cancer researchers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But part of the story could be colibactin, a toxin made by certain strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; and other bacteria. In a study out this week, researchers have identified a strong link between this DNA-damaging toxin and colon cancer among younger patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team, based at the University of California, San Diego, analyzed tissue samples from close to 1,000 colorectal cancer patients across four continents. They found the majority had cancers bearing mutations that signaled a past encounter with colibactin.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You can think of it as the weapon system of a bacteria to fight other bacteria and to defend themselves," says &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=Ludmil+Alexandrov&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank"&gt;Ludmil Alexandrov&lt;/a&gt;, the lead author of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" target="_blank"&gt;was published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Strikingly, those under the age of 40 with early-onset colon cancer were three to five times more likely to have these mutations than those in their 70s and older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The thinking goes that in some people, this bacterial weaponry — technically called a "genotoxin" — can get directed at their gut cells, seeding mutations that put them at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to their data, this exposure isn't ongoing when the cancer is diagnosed. Instead, it appears to have happened during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our estimate is that it happens within the first 10 years of life," Alexandrov says. "So if you get that mutation at age 5, that puts you 20 to 30 years ahead of schedule for getting colorectal cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the study shows a strong association, the data can't prove colibactin &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; these patients to develop cancer at a younger age. And researchers in the field don't expect &lt;em&gt;E. coli,&lt;/em&gt; or any single microbe for that matter, to be the skeleton key for the surge in colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"That would be too simple,"&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;says &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=Christian+Jobin%2C&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank"&gt;Christian Jobin&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiome researcher at the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More likely, he says, colibactin — studied closely in &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;but produced by other bacteria, too &lt;em&gt;— &lt;/em&gt;is one "hit" among many to our microbiome, which together may place some people on a faster trajectory for developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What triggers a DNA-damaging toxin&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study is a new clue into the rise in colorectal cancer in the young. Scientists believe some confluence of environmental factors, including diet, a sedentary lifestyle, medication and so on, is driving this steep rise. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These could be having downstream effects on the microbes in our gut like &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been really perplexing," says &lt;a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/dey-neelendu.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Neelendu Dey&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist whose lab focuses on the gut microbiome at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. "The microbes that may contribute to cancer risk are tricky to understand."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The family of microbes to which &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; belongs is actually the most prevalent type of bacteria in your gut during the very early stages of life. In other words, it's not some new infectious agent that needs to be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About 20% to 30% of people have strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that can synthesize this toxin, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily having "deleterious effects," says Jobin, whose lab has pioneered related research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adding to the puzzle: Not everyone with colorectal cancer has these signatures of colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's something provoking the bacteria to behave this way, perhaps giving it an advantage to grow in more abundance. "What triggers this weapon or the deployment?" Jobin says. "We don't know but we have to consider the environment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know that some of these &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that produce colibactin are influenced by diet, inflammation, and medication," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jobin says the new research is "fantastic" because it bridges early preclinical research in animals with "real life humans," and opens new avenues for research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Studies conducted on animals have shown colibactin exposure can drive cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, deleting the genetic region responsible for producing this toxin in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; can actually incapacitate the bacteria from promoting cancer in animals. Feeding the animals more or less fiber can affect tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Antibiotics use and nutrition, could be at play&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because they sequenced the genome of cancer from patients all over the globe, Alexandrov says the researchers&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;could tell these mutations related to colibactin are actually quite rare in more "rural, non-industrialized" regions of Africa and Asia, whereas they turn up more frequently in the U.S. and Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;That evidence, coupled with the findings that it's a result of early childhood exposure, gives them a handful of hypotheses about what could be at play.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says some of their top suspects are the mode of birth (cesarean section vs. vaginal delivery), breastfeeding, the use of antibiotics and nutrition, for example whether children were &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt;fed ultra processed foods.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;All of these factors are known to substantially affect the microbiome and there is some evidence they may impact this [colibactin producing] bacteria, but we really need to investigate each one carefully."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dey views all of these as plausible, particularly antibiotics, given that other research teams &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37504220/" target="_blank"&gt;have linked early-life antibiotic use&lt;/a&gt; to increased risk of colorectal cancer later on.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More broadly, he says he hopes researchers can eventually find microbes that serve as "biomarkers" for identifying people at risk of developing pre-cancers. And, perhaps down the line, drugs can be designed to target toxins like colibactin to counter their harmful effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;Of course, it sounds simple, but we have to acknowledge the ecological lessons learned in other contexts," he says. "When you try to take out, or introduce a species, it can have effects that you didn't anticipate, so this all needs to be done very thoughtfully."&lt;/p&gt;

Plantar warts typically develop on the soles of the feet and palms and can become painful due to pressure,” she says, adding that flat warts, which are often smoother in appearance, are often found in clusters on the face, legs, or backs of the hands. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given their high contraction rate and potential for reoccurrence (yes, they are contagious), you may be in search of some at-home solutions that can rid your complexion of these bumpy burdens once and for all — and Murphy-Rose says that these treatments certainly do exist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The goal of wart treatment is to destroy or remove all virally infected skin cells. This causes the wart tissue to break down, blister, or slough off,” she says, citing over-the-counter treatments such a cryotherapy kits and salicylic acid-based topicals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These treatments, Murphy-Rose cautions, “tend to be less effective than in-office procedures and can cause side effects such as irritation, burning, scarring, or pigmentation changes.” She suggests treating warts early to prevent spreading or deeper growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Murphy-Rose and another expert we spoke to suggest consulting your dermatologist before doing any of the at-home treatments that we’ve rounded up here, based on their product recommendations and guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The treatments mentioned in this story are only advised for use on the above-mentioned warts and not for sexually transmitted genital warts.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli cli-listicle listicleCountUp"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Amazon"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;A cryotherapy kit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Board-certified dermatologist &lt;a href="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/noah-gratch-md" target="_blank" role="link" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Noah Gratch" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680815fde4b0deaad526f2d1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/noah-gratch-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="34"&gt;Dr. Noah Gratch&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/" target="_blank" role="link" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="MDCS Dermatology " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680815fde4b0deaad526f2d1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="35"&gt;MDCS Dermatology &lt;/a&gt;said that cryotherapy, which involves freezing the wart with liquid nitrogen, is a common in-office wart removal treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

								&lt;p&gt;The world, and countless generations of interactions with it, coaxed our brains to evolve in the unique way that humans perceive reality. And yet, thanks to the past century's developments in &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/02/08/three-major-things-most-people-get-about-the-brain-according-to-a-neuroscientist/" target="_blank"&gt;cognitive science&lt;/a&gt; and now &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/artificial_intelligence" target="_blank"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, we have entrenched a view of the brain that doesn't spend much time on this dynamic. Instead, most of us tend to see our brains as a "network" made of undifferentiated brain cells. These neurons produce cognition by the patterns in which groups of them fire at once — a model that has inspired advanced computers and AI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But accumulating discoveries of different specialized brain cells pose a challenge to models of human or artificial intelligence in which thoughts and concepts arise purely from the distributed firing of many essentially-identical brain cells in a network. Perhaps it's time to consider that if we want to replicate human intelligence, we ought to take a closer look at some of the amazing adaptations that have evolved in mammalian neurons — and specifically, neurons in the human brain. Instead of the popularly understood idea of the brain as a neural network of undifferentiated brain cells, research has increasingly found that different neurons, even of the same basic type, have their own specific functions and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, in the modern, popular understanding of the brain, we really tend to think of this organ as a sophisticated version of the technology it inspired. Merriam-Webster &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neural%20network" target="_blank"&gt;defines neural network&lt;/a&gt; as "a computer architecture in which a number of processors are interconnected in a manner suggestive of the connections between neurons in a human brain and which is able to learn by a process of trial and error." This is a typical definition, in which the computer-brain analogy focuses on the distributed connections between neurons (or, in a computer, nodes) with no attention to what exactly those neurons are for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a definition that has been good enough since the 1980s, when future Nobel Prize-winner Geoffrey Hinton and others picked up on an older idea called backpropagation, applying it as &lt;a href="https://codewave.com/insights/development-of-neural-networks-history/#:~:text=Developed%20by%20Frank%20Rosenblatt%20in,tasks%2C%20learning%20from%20input%20data.&amp;amp;text=The%20perceptron%20could%20only%20solve,divided%20by%20a%20straight%20line)." target="_blank"&gt;an algorithm that mimics human brains&lt;/a&gt; by systematically reducing errors through repeated iterations and thus allows for more efficient training of multilayer neural networks. This reinvigorated the earlier idea that a system of nodes and connections that mimics the human brain might work to create an artificial form of intelligence, leading to the deep learning models and machine learning we have today. Since the discipline of artificial intelligence latched onto the neural network, though, it's largely focused on developing different forms of artificial (or simulated) neural networks, and mostly moved away from studying the human or animal brain as an artifact of evolution with specifics worth mimicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual pieces of research have gradually identified a host of different brain cell types, upending our simple image of the brain as a very powerful computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while it's true that that most neurons are important only for their firing or non-firing, not for their specific role, even as computer scientists have been expanding the things that artificial neural networks can do, research on the brain itself has continued. Over decades, and especially the past few years, individual pieces of research have gradually identified a host of different brain cell types, upending our simple image of the brain as merely a very powerful computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they reveal mammalian brains to be the product of millions of years of evolution and adaptation to environments. Over all those years, countless tiny changes have led animal brains to evolve a unique nervous system in which the key component, the neuron, is now able to represent our experiences and thoughts and surroundings in specific and wondrously clever ways not available to other animals who have not evolved our most recent adaptations. Our particular form of intelligence, it seems, depends on this minority of specialized neuron types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The brain as a computer &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2001, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278262601912990" target="_blank"&gt;Yuri Arshavsky wrote&lt;/a&gt;, "I argue that individual neurons may play an important, if not decisive, role in performing cognitive functions of the brain." At that time the research was already accumulating, but the idea went counter to the prevailing view in neuroscience. By now, though, it's becoming hard to argue against Arshavsky's claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are brain cells that represent entire concepts, some with an affinity for visual information and others for olfactory input. Scientists have also found neurons that can encode entire concepts with the firing of a single cell, or that are devoted to specific aspects of cognition and how we represent the world, and that fire when their particular function is needed: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5062957/" target="_blank"&gt;warm-sensitive neurons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(23)01250-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124723012500%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;place cells&lt;/a&gt; and related &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39322671/" target="_blank"&gt;time cells&lt;/a&gt;, olfactory concept cells, visual concept cells, Lepr neurons that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049524003287?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;control metabolism&lt;/a&gt;... the list of discoveries is long and still growing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research looking into the already-brewing notion of time and space-encoding cells demonstrates how different cell types &lt;a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39322671/" target="_blank"&gt;work together&lt;/a&gt; to give us both "what" and "where" information that allows our brains to represent our experience of time. Researchers still haven't decided how best to classify all the different types, but they &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10995314/" target="_blank"&gt;are increasingly trying to map&lt;/a&gt; the specific kinds of input they encode through the patterns of which neurons fire when, and the relationships between the different representations this creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;I do agree that today’s AI models have important deficiencies — and among them might be that they lack some of the predispositions various parts of our brains may have," Jay McClelland, a noted cognitive scientist at Stanford University, told Salon in an email. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI is doing incredible (and &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" target="_blank"&gt;destructive&lt;/a&gt;) things these days, solving impossible medical problems and generating imagery that manages the trick of being simultaneously trite and bizarre. T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;he computing power this requires sucks water from a parched earth and puts entire creative industries &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240612-the-people-making-ai-sound-more-human" target="_blank"&gt;out of work&lt;/a&gt;. AI models that act as "artificial brains" are able to do therapy, provide health care or write (in a manner of speaking.) But there are ways in which the large language models and similar generative AI are missing not simply the feeling of being human, but the actual function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we know we think differently from computers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our understanding of how the brain works at the single neuron level — equivalent to a node in an artificial neural network — comes from studies of murine (mouse or rat) or primate models, because it isn't considered ethical to do brain surgery on humans just to find out what interesting things are going on in our brains. So it's only with the recent development of a technique that allows for single neuron recordings to be taken during unavoidably necessary brain surgery done on epilepsy patients for diagnostic purposes that researchers gained subjects who would be available for perhaps a week at a time to look at things and talk about them while scientists recorded which neurons fired, how intensely, and for how long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very particular situation, but luckily there are many people with epilepsy of different kinds, and a subset of them need electrodes implanted in their brains to record their spontaneous seizures over the course of a week or two so as to figure out if they are a candidate for surgery to cure them. These implants are done in two parts of the brain that often produce seizures, the medial temporal lobe and the medial frontal lobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of brain cells are neurons, while some cells have other functions. But the exact number of neuron types is unknown, although &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add7046?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank"&gt;recent research in human brains&lt;/a&gt; has identified at least two million neurons, which researchers were able to categorize into different types: "31 superclusters, 461 clusters, and 3313 subclusters," resulting in a massive number of individual types. It's remarkably different from the simple three neuron types classification — motor neurons, sensory neurons, and interneurons — one might have learned in a cursory overview of brain science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itzhak Fried, lead author on the newly published research on time and space cells, is a neurosurgeon at UCLA whose lab, and postdoctoral students trained there, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/25/what-makes-humans-intelligent-these-unique-neurons-might-hold-the-key/" target="_blank"&gt;spawned many of the major discoveries of these specialized neuron types&lt;/a&gt;. Fried told Salon about the two decades of research, or more, that have led to the profusion of concept cells and other neuron types we now understand to play critical roles in encoding and representing our experience with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just with the world, but with our imaginations, and experiences that now live only in memory rather than being triggered by external stimuli. Fried cited the work of Hagar Gelbard-Sagiv, a postdoc in his lab, who, as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18772395/#full-view-affiliation-1" target="_blank"&gt;described in a 2008 paper&lt;/a&gt;, found that when subjects were shown a variety of film clips while researchers recorded the activity of single neurons in their hippocampus and surrounding areas, a subset of those neurons fired in response to a particular concept — there was one neuron, for example, that began firing at the start of a clip from "The Simpsons" and continued firing despite the changing images on the screen. That is, it responded not to a specific image but to the general Simpsons concept — and not to any other videos that weren't Simpsons-related. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more remarkable was that when the movie-watchers were asked to tell the researchers what they'd seen, they would begin to describe the assortment of 20-odd movie clips they'd been shown, and that particular neuron would fire during the actual act of remembering the Simpsons video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"After we presented, let's say, 20 videos ... we said to the patient, 'Just tell us what you say, okay?' She says, 'well, you know, I remember Martin Luther King's speech, and I saw a landing on the moon'. And suddenly the Simpsons neuron started firing and then a second later, [the patient] says 'The Simpsons'," Fried recalled for Salon. "It's as if there was some process going on [that] she didn't even realize yet, as there was already a signature of that memory. Obviously there was no sensory input. She was completely locked in her mind. And that concept neuron started firing, and the memory came out, essentially emerged at the conscious level."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, we &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;work like computers and use distributed networks of firing neurons in important ways. In fact, most parts of the brain work like that, Dr. Florian Mormann, a cognitive and clinical neurophysiologist at the University of Bonn who conducts single neuron recordings on epilepsy patients (and who was a postdoc in Fried's lab), told Salon in a video interview. "One control region we have in the visual pathway is the parahippocampal cortex, which indeed features a distributed network code, which is what most of the brain regions do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the Simpsons neuron case, for example, it was just a subset of neurons in the medial temporal lobe that behaved with extreme specificity to enable patients to quickly grasp the relevant concept. Just a single neuron could determine the patient's memory that a video of, say, Itchy and Scratchy, or of Moe's bar, or of a three-eyed fish at the Springfield nuclear power plant, was a video about the Simpsons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI just doesn't work like that. Instead, it analyzes large amounts of data to detect patterns, and its algorithms rely on the statistical probability of a particular decision being the right one. Incorrectly chosen, biased or inadequately large data sets can result in the famous "hallucinations" &lt;a href="https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/basics/addressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias/" target="_blank"&gt;to which AI models are prone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It comes to a fundamental issue about what sort of a system do we need to model intelligence," McClelland explained in a keynote talk, Fundamental Challenges for AI, that he delivered last April at the Computer History Museum in Palo Alto, CA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing to Salon, he offered the example of place cells, the specialized neuron he's most familiar with. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"There are different views, but the role and nature of so-called place cells is extremely nuanced.  These cells can code for all kinds of things in tasks that aren’t simply requiring animals to move around in space," McClelland said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;McClelland pointed out that the differences between human brains and artificial intelligence systems include how we learn. Indeed, learning and the necessary process of memory formation and retrieval are key to the specialized roles played by concept cells and some of our other specialized neurons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I also think that our brains use far different learning algorithms than our current deep learning systems," McClelland said. "I’m taking inspiration from a fairly-recently discovered new form of learning called Behavioral Time Scale Synaptic plasticity [BTSP] to think about our brains might have come to be able to learn with far less training data than we currently need to train contemporary AI systems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts in the human brain, as we've seen, can be encoded with just a small number of neurons firing, or even just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pattern recognition that allows AI to learn is based on something called Hebbian-style synaptic plasticity, based on Donald Hebb's idea that learning arises through repeated use of the same connections between neurons in the brain: repeated activation strengthens the efficiency of cells firing together. The term "synaptic plasticity" just means the ability of these connections to be strengthened or otherwise changed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;The prevailing theories of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century and later all proposed that the primary mechanism of CA3 ensemble or attractor formation was Hebbian style synaptic plasticity, based on correlated AP [action potential, or neurons firing] activity&lt;span&gt;," write the authors of &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01141-3" target="_blank"&gt;a study published in Cell in November&lt;/a&gt; that explored the dynamics of neurons contributing to memory formation. Hebbian-style synaptic plasticity allows for creation of memories and learning from experience within a network of neurons and synapses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the basic understanding that underlies deep learning models used in AI. But the authors of the Cell study propose that in human brains, what's actually going on is a different form of synaptic plasticity, BTSP, which allows for far fewer firings of neurons to create a memory — in fact, you might just need a single "event" to result in learning. Like another hypothesis for how neurons do their thing, the sparse coding hypothesis, BTSP works well because it doesn't need the kind of overlap that Hebbian-style plasticity requires. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts in the human brain, as we've seen, can be encoded with just a small number of neurons firing, or even just one, Mormann explained: "So when I say sparse versus network, or sparse versus distributed, that means that [most] neurons are silent, and then just a few neurons suddenly say 'Look, this is my favorite stimulus.' It indicates that that stimulus is there."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A reason evolution might allow itself "the luxury of having these sparse representations" when network codes would be more efficient, Mormann suggested, is that "they actually provide the semantic building blocks that are being pieced together to form mnemonic episodes." That is, our episodic memories are pieced together from a small number of concepts embellished by the brain's tendency to make up less important details, or to remain fuzzy about them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The only things that are really reliable and can be reliably tested are a few core semantic facts, and those are the ones that we believe are represented or provided by concept neurons, and they are being pieced together to form episodic memories," Mormann said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we have not yet created a complete picture of how humans represent experience, including through the apparently vital roles played by concept cells, place or grid cells, time cells and other specialized cell types, it's becoming clearer that neurons in animals have evolved unique adaptations. Researchers have, for example, identified thousands of specialized neurons in mice. But they help them do mouse things. In humans, culture, language, care, tools and other still-to-be demonstrated ways in which we interact with the world around us has produced specializations that let us encode entire concepts and think in an abstract way, internally representing our experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So AI might do well to look back at how the world has shaped us, letting us do human things by the way our brains now make the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have gotten one step closer to growing replacement teeth in the lab — a development that could pave the way for new alternatives to unpleasant dental fillings and root canals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed a special material that allows cells to communicate with one another just as they would in the body, therefore enabling them to develop into tooth cells, the researchers reported in a study published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmacrolett.4c00520" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmacrolett.4c00520" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACS Macro Letters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process allows scientists to grow teeth from a patient's cells in the lab. Someday, it could enable damaged or infected teeth to be replaced by real teeth, rather than being repaired using fillings and other dental procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans typically grow two sets of teeth in their lifetime: Around 20 baby teeth start coming in at around &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11179-teething-teething-syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11179-teething-teething-syndrome" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 months&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of age and are then gradually replaced by 32 adult teeth starting at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sheffieldchildrens.nhs.uk/patients-and-parents/looking-after-your-teeth/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sheffieldchildrens.nhs.uk/patients-and-parents/looking-after-your-teeth/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about age 6&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some animals, like sharks or crocodiles, can constantly replace missing teeth, but humans are limited to these two sets. This is because animals that can keep replacing their teeth never lose the tooth stem cells that allow them to constantly grow new teeth.

Teeth begin &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3000521/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3000521/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;growing from stem cells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during early embryonic development, with stem cells from different types of embryonic tissue "talking" to each other using signaling molecules to trigger tooth formation. The stem cells differentiate into various forms of cells, which then secrete the materials that the tooth is eventually made from, such as enamel, dentin and cementum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers described how they made a crucial breakthrough by developing a material that allowed the stem cells to communicate as they would in the body. The material was made from hydrogel — a soft, gel-like material that can absorb large amounts of water — and emulates the environment around the cells in the body, known as the matrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This meant that when we introduced the cultured cells, they were able to send signals to each other to start the tooth formation process," Zhang said. "Previous attempts had failed, as all the signals were sent in one go. This new material releases signals slowly over time, replicating what happens in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A researcher holding a normal tooth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: King's College London)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such tooth replacements would be longer-lasting, stronger and much less likely to be rejected by the body, which occurs in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-implant-problems" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-implant-problems" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;between 5 and 10%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of tooth implants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lab-grown teeth would naturally regenerate, integrating into the jaw as real teeth," Zhang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are still far from implanting a replacement tooth into a human patient. Right now, they're working to figure out the best way for a tooth to be introduced into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have different ideas to put the teeth inside the mouth," Zhang said. "We could transplant the young tooth cells at the location of the missing tooth and let them grow inside [the] mouth. Alternatively, we could create the whole tooth in the lab before placing it in the patient’s mouth. For both options, we need to start the very early tooth development process in the lab."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the development could pave the way for new alternatives to fillings and implants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the field progresses, the integration of such innovative techniques holds the potential to revolutionise dental care, offering sustainable and effective solutions for tooth repair and regeneration," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ana-angelova-volponi" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ana-angelova-volponi" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ana Angelova Volponi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at King's College London, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

Getting quality sleep — the kind that leaves you feeling refreshed and ready for the day — is critical for a healthy brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;People with disturbed sleep, like insomnia or sleep apnea, have a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079217300114" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/well/mind/sleep-dementia.html" title=""&gt;developing dementia&lt;/a&gt; than those with no sleep issues. Poor sleep can harm your brain in other ways, too. &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000208056" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that people in their 30s and 40s with heavily disrupted sleep (such as frequent awakenings or movements) were two to three times more likely to test lower in executive function, working memory and processing speeds a decade or so later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists think that deep sleep and rapid eye movement (or REM) sleep are particularly influential when it comes to brain health and dementia risk. A &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40110600/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study published last month&lt;/a&gt; on people with deep sleep and REM deficiencies found that the subjects’ brains showed signs of atrophy in M.R.I. scans 13 to 17 years after the deficiencies were observed; the atrophy looked similar to what you’d find in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-537baae6"&gt;What Scientists Know So Far&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When you’re asleep, your brain continuously cycles through four distinct phases: Two stages of lighter sleep, when your body relaxes and your heart rate and temperature drop; deep sleep or slow wave sleep, when brain activity slows; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/well/mind/rem-sleep-benefits.html" title=""&gt;REM&lt;/a&gt;, when you typically dream. The brain generally takes about 90 minutes to cycle through all four stages and then restarts the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Deep sleep and REM help your brain “heal itself” from fatigue and stress and consolidate memories, said Matthew Pase, an associate professor at the School of Psychological Sciences at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. In deep sleep, your brain regulates metabolism and hormones; it also acts as a “rinse” for the brain, clearing out waste. REM is when your brain processes emotions and new information you picked up when you were awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The two phases influence dementia risk in different ways, scientists think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As part of the rinsing process in deep sleep, your brain flushes out amyloid proteins that are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. Years of interrupted deep sleep and incomplete flushing — known as &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8186542/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;glymphatic failure&lt;/a&gt; — could hasten the onset of dementia, said Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who researches the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chances are, when you wake up, it’s been at least a few hours since you’ve had anything to drink. “After hours without fluid, your body (and brain!) are craving it,” says &lt;a href="https://alexandria-hardy-rdn.clientsecure.me/#about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexandria Hardy, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, of Pennsylvania Nutrition Services.

However, it’s important to replenish the fluids lost during sleep. “While we sleep, we lose water from sweating and breathing. That’s why it’s important to refill our tank in the morning!” says &lt;a href="https://flavorfulnutrition.com/stacy-davis-registered-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stacy Roberts-Davis, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Flavorful Nutrition LLC.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Drinking water first thing can help your body wake up and start your day feeling good,” says Roberts-Davis. Studies show that hydration is closely linked with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. For example, one study found that participants with a lower hydration status also had a greater decline in their cognitive function over a two-year period.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the many functions of fluids is promoting healthy digestion. Your body needs fluids to soften stool and make it easier to pass. It works hand-in-hand with fiber to do just that. Especially if you &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911394/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-constipation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;struggle with constipation&lt;/a&gt;, you may notice digestive benefits from adding a glass of water to your morning routine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Hydration helps ensure proper kidney function and aids in preventing kidney stones,” says &lt;a href="https://theeverydaykidneycook.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beverly Garden, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Your kidneys need water to remove waste through your urine. If there’s too little water, the waste may collect in your blood and be unable to reach your kidneys. It’s also more likely that certain substances will crystallize in your kidneys, forming kidney stones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, studies show that drinking more fluids is linked with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-eat-to-prevent-kidney-stones-11705389" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduced risk of kidney stones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking water in the morning may also help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. One study examined the benefits of adding about 18 ounces of water upon waking and another 18 ounces before bed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It found that this hydration regimen (which added up to about 2 liters of total fluid per day) led to a decrease in blood pressure. Why? Drinking more water helps remove excess sodium, alters hormones involved in blood pressure management and makes it easier for blood to flow through your blood vessels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even if it seems simple, we know that it’s not always easy to adopt a new healthy habit. Dietitians shared a few easy strategies for improving your morning hydration:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Water on Your Nightstand: &lt;/strong&gt;“Keep water handy at your bedside. Then, drink 8 to 16 ounces right away before even getting out of bed,” suggests Garden. This can help you remember to hydrate before you get busy preparing for your day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair It with Another Habit:&lt;/strong&gt; Pairing a new habit with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906041/things-you-should-do-before-8-am-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;an existing one&lt;/a&gt; may make it easier to adopt, like pairing a glass of water with your morning medications or supplements. “Many pills actually require a full glass of water to be absorbed properly in the body. By drinking a full glass when you wake up, you are aiding in your daily water intake as well,” says &lt;a href="https://www.arugalyssa.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alyssa Smolen, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a media and community dietitian. Don’t take pills in the morning? Challenge yourself to finish a glass of water before your coffee brews, or sip on herbal tea as you read the morning news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Overlook Other Sources of Hydration:&lt;/strong&gt; “Whether it’s hot tea, a green smoothie or a tall glass of water, starting your morning strong with hydration is key,” says Hardy. Notice that it doesn’t only have to be water. Incorporating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-no-added-sugar-drinks-to-hydrate-8675270" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;other drinks&lt;/a&gt;, like herbal tea or smoothies, into your morning can help hydrate you at the start of your day. Also keep in mind that incorporating water-rich foods at breakfast also counts toward your hydration needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adopting healthy morning habits doesn’t have to be time-consuming. In fact, dietitians agree that the healthiest habit to start before 9 a.m. is simply hydrating. Starting your day off with a glass of water may counter nighttime dehydration, promote alertness, support healthy digestion and blood pressure and lower your risk of kidney stones. If you don’t love water, try a smoothie or a cup of herbal tea. To meet your overall fluid needs, be sure to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-way-to-stay-hydrated-ally-love-interview-8702860" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;keep your hydration up&lt;/a&gt; throughout the rest of the day, too!

They are generally high in salt, fat, sugar and contain artificial additives and can also lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And scientists say they are often cheap, convenient and heavily marketed. Study first author Dr Kiara Chang, of Imperial College London's School of Public Health, said: “The average person in the UK consumes more than half of their daily energy intake from ultra-processed foods. This is exceptionally high and concerning as ultra-processed foods are produced with industrially derived ingredients and often use food additives to adjust colour, flavour, consistency, texture, or extend shelf life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our bodies may not react the same way to these ultra-processed ingredients and additives as they do to fresh and nutritious minimally processed foods. However, ultra-processed foods are everywhere and highly marketed with cheap price and attractive packaging to promote consumption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This shows our food environment needs urgent reform to protect the population from ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers used UK Biobank records to gather their data. They studied the diets of 200,000 middle-aged adults. They monitored their health over 10 years, looking at the risk of developing any cancer overall as well as the specific risk of developing 34 different types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team also looked into the risk of people dying from cancer. The study revealed that the higher consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with a greater risk of developing cancer overall, while putting people more at risk specifically of ovarian and brain cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was also associated with an increased risk of dying from cancer, most notably with ovarian and breast cancers. For every 10 per cent increase in ultra-processed food in a person’s diet, there was an increased incidence of two per cent for cancer overall and a 19 per cent increase for ovarian cancer specifically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For adults, the more of these ultra-processed food they ate, the higher the risk they had of developing obesity and type two diabetes. With children in the UK, the more ultra-processed foods they ate, the more weight they gained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These links remained even after adjusting for a range of socio-economic, behavioural and dietary factors, such as smoking status, physical activity and body mass index. The Imperial College London team have previously reported that levels of consumption of ultra-processed foods in the UK are the highest in Europe for both adults and children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation has previously recommended restricting ultra-processed foods as part of a healthy sustainable diet. There are now ongoing efforts to reduce ultra-processed food consumption around the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Countries such as Brazil, France and Canada have updated their national dietary guidelines with recommendations to limit such foods. Brazil has also banned the marketing of ultra-processed foods in schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there are currently no similar measures to tackle ultra-processed foods in the UK. Dr Chang added: “We need clear front of pack warning labels for ultra-processed foods to aid consumer choices, and our sugar tax should be extended to cover ultra-processed fizzy drinks, fruit-based and milk-based drinks, as well as other ultra-processed products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Lower income households are particularly vulnerable to these cheap and unhealthy ultra-processed foods. Minimally processed and freshly prepared meals should be subsidised to ensure everyone has access to healthy, nutritious and affordable options.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Eszter Vamos, of the University’s School of Public Health, said: “This study adds to the growing evidence that ultra-processed foods are likely to negatively impact our health including our risk for cancer. "Given the high levels of consumption in UK adults and children, this has important implications for future health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Although our study cannot prove causation, other available evidence shows that reducing ultra-processed foods in our diet could provide important health benefits. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and understand the best public health strategies to reduce the widespread presence and harms of ultra-processed foods in our diet.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal EClinicalMedicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 07:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQZmRGb0d0TEJaU09MOXZsOS13eGU1SUNrbkxOUFRlNHRYQjBFT3U1VFQybzJWd3luRXRBS255SkNKZTV2VkV0ZVJoSUg4UUhLTE5QMTVzMXJ1b0lVLWVncFlTM0Z1ZzU2YWxsUk1mVkItYVBINWVycEtOSE4xdkRxcHFkY9IBiAFBVV95cUxQN09Od3BrWHAtRXVsY054elg2LVM5Zm1iRGx4aU1rNHBCanUwUTNKTlNkNTJiVzVEMjA4SVVzUXQ2OXMyYjJxZUZ1ay1KeHZJRURfS0VicWF1X3puOU43ODhDXzN0U2tlOExVZ09xbUVqZnBrS1RyWFpMRVhSM1lQZTFXY1pPV0d2</guid></item><item><title>医生说，削减一种食物会降低患癌症的风险- Surrey Live | Doctors say cutting one type of food slashes risk of getting cancer - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQZmRGb0d0TEJaU09MOXZsOS13eGU1SUNrbkxOUFRlNHRYQjBFT3U1VFQybzJWd3luRXRBS255SkNKZTV2VkV0ZVJoSUg4UUhLTE5QMTVzMXJ1b0lVLWVncFlTM0Z1ZzU2YWxsUk1mVkItYVBINWVycEtOSE4xdkRxcHFkYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods such as sliced bread, breakfast cereals, fizzy pop and many ready meals could put people more at risk of cancer, according to a recent study.
