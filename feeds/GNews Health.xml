			&lt;p&gt;A leading treatment for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_hair_loss"&gt;androgenetic alopecia&lt;/a&gt; (AGA) – the classic pattern hair loss – could be made more effective with the clever addition of the natural sweetener stevioside, derived from the stevia plant (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia_rebaudiana"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stevia rebaudiana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18238-minoxidil-topical-solution-or-foam"&gt;Minoxidil&lt;/a&gt; is a popular treatment for AGA that is rubbed into the scalp: it works by revitalizing hair follicles with increased blood flow, but not much of it gets absorbed into the skin. Various forms of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.126013"&gt;microneedle&lt;/a&gt; patches have been tested to improve penetration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers from China and Australia combined stevioside with microneedle patches, primarily because stevioside helps minoxidil dissolve much better in water. Using this method, much more minoxidil should get under the skin to the hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/decades-of-studies-link-suicide-risk-with-common-hair-loss-treatment"&gt;Decades of Studies Link Suicide Risk With Common Hair Loss Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach was tested in mice that had been genetically engineered to lose hair, and the results were promising. Much more of the minoxidil made it into the skin, and more hair grew back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a significant increase in hair follicle transition to the growth phase, which resulted in 67.5 percent coverage of the treatment area by day 35," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Collectively, the results highlight the potential of the stevioside microneedle delivery system for the treatment of AGA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177065" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177065" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults.jpg" alt="Mice baldness" class="wp-image-177065 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults-512x415.jpg 512w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults-600x486.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177065" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new treatment significantly improved hair growth in mice. (Zhang et al., &lt;em&gt;Adv. Healthc. Mater.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For mice treated with a standard minoxidil solution, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-hair-loss-breakthrough-a-sugar-gel-sparks-robust-regrowth"&gt;hair grew back&lt;/a&gt; in just 25.7 percent of the coverage area by day 35, which is a significant improvement to minoxidil on its own. Hair growth started around a week earlier, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As promising as these results are, they're for mouse hair and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-hair-loss-drug-approved-restores-80-of-hair-loss-in-some-alopecia-patients"&gt;not human hair&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers are still experimenting with the microneedle delivery system and the minoxidil mix to find the best method of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The benefits and drawbacks of various technical methods, such as metal or soluble microneedles and sustained-release systems, should be evaluated in conjunction with specific clinical scenarios," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further testing will be required in larger animal studies before human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="177062" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; can get underway, and only at that point can scientists assess how these microneedle patches might work on people – while any side effects or other complications can also be weighed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term viability also needs to be assessed. Current minoxidil treatments need to be applied &lt;a href="https://drhair.co.uk/blog/how-often-should-i-apply-minoxidil/"&gt;at least once a day&lt;/a&gt;, and while microneedle delivery might change that, it needs to be suitable for regular applications.&lt;br&gt;

"Using stevioside to enhance minoxidil delivery represents a promising step toward more effective and natural treatments for hair loss, potentially benefiting millions worldwide," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Can-a-Stevia-derived-sweetener-improve-hair-loss-treatment/default.aspx"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmacologist Lifeng Kang, from the University of Sydney in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While 1.13million Americans are living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A preacher talks to drug users in Philadelphia in 2023 as good Samaritans distribute food and warm clothing for those affected by the drug epidemic and homelessness (file image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US drug epidemic has slowed in recent months, however, amid a crackdown on drug trafficking by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overdose fatalities have dropped nearly 24 percent over the 12 months to April 2025, the latest available, with an estimated 76,516 fatalities, compared to an estimated 101,363 fatalities over the previous year-long period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether bluetoothing is already taking place in the US, but some experts have warned that addicts may be put off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say that one reason the practice is not more widespread is that it tends to deliver users with a diminished high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It often is not clear how much of a high those who infuse themselves with another drug users blood receive, with this potentially being no different to a placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Catharine Cook, the executive director of Harm Reduction International, a nonprofit based in the UK, told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/world/asia/bluetoothing-drug-blood-sharing.html"&gt;New York Times:&lt;/a&gt; 'It's the perfect way of spreading HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'&lt;span&gt;It’s a wake-up call for health systems and governments, the speed with which you can end up with a massive spike of infection because of the efficiency of transmission.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Fiji, in 2014 the country had fewer than 500 people living with HIV, but by 2024 this number had surged to approximately 5,900.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the same year, the Pacific island nation recorded 1,583 new cases of HIV, equivalent to a 13-fold increase on its usual five-year average. About half of all new infected patients said they had been sharing needles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows drug overdose deaths by year in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the percent change in drug overdose deaths from April 2024 to April 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kalesi Volatabu, executive director of the non-profit Drug Free Fiji, described to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m42dwvlk8o"&gt;BBC &lt;/a&gt;the moment that she witnessed the practice firsthand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I saw the needle with the blood, it was right there in front of me,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This young woman, she'd already had the shot and she's taking out the blood, and then you've got other girls, other adults, already lining up to be hit with this thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'It's not just needles they're sharing, they're sharing the blood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimates suggest about 33.5 percent of drug users in the US share needles, which also poses a risk of transmitting HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that the virus, alongside other diseases such as hepatitis, can get onto the needle if it is used by an infected person, and then be transferred to another individual who also uses the same needle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In general, HIV rates in the US have fallen since 2017. However, due to disruptions in care in 2020 from the Covid pandemic, which means HIV cases were likely missed, new diagnoses have been slightly increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, in the US and its associated territories, there were 39,201 new HIV diagnoses in 2023, the latest data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an increase from the 37,721 new cases in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 2023 cases, the newest CDC report on HIV shows 518 diagnoses were associated with intravenous drug use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts emphasize that HIV is no longer a death sentence, saying that there are drugs available that can slow the virus' replication and allow someone infected to live a full and normal life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The practice of bluetoothing was first recorded in Tanzania around 2010, where it quickly spread from the country's inner city to the suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Zanzibar, a tourism haven in the nation where the practice took hold, researchers found HIV rates were up to 30 times higher than those recorded in the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been recorded in Lesotho, a small African nation bordering South Africa, and Pakistan, where people have sold half-used blood-infused syringes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:27:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPZjdTWGFEZl9iRDlfUlFMQ1dEY2t4Qkw5VEREME52VzZocFlxYXZyWFJpYS1KU19iZDV6SGptUkR6aVQxUjNPQm01dDBjWjhwd01ZdlhPUFhOMUxQT3g2MVZXRTlYMFR3UEpFM1BLamQ2NDBFa1NySXdObEppSkc0dExDb2pQVm5jRmM5VlM4V3Z0MTc4MWdBT1hjQzLSAaIBQVVfeXFMT2ItYXB6YUtORVpkeThycUg3MTRiYS1US3ZjVkY5elF2TkozMmdCYmt6cE9seWJmZTNMOVJkY0dqcm52MzRYMjJENUtJRHhza05HekkxelplVFZRQzU2UVk1R0VfbWVrRjJUYURaYU43MWVDYkhPd0c1TEJmNHRNb2ZmTnZsa3hCUzZZZlA3THRpUENXelJSQ054MnotNWhBN2F3</guid></item><item><title>新的1天手术在同一手术中切除癌症并重建乳房- ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/US/new-1-day-surgery-removes-cancer-reconstructs-breast/story?id=126492962</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;When the results of her routine mammogram came back with a diagnosis of stage 0 DCIS breast cancer in multiple areas of her right breast, Athaliah McPherson, a hairstylist and mom of one, said she wasn’t surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I knew something was off," McPherson told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson’s diagnosis was not life-threatening in and of itself, but left unchecked, it might have developed into something more serious. Typically, doctors treat DCIS with partial or full breast removal surgery, sometimes followed by radiation or hormone therapy to lower future risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson was referred to the Montefiore Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There, her team -- led by Dr. Pedro Piccinini, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and Dr. Maureen McEvoy, a breast surgical oncologist -- recommended McPherson undergo a new procedure called total breast reconstruction, which combines mastectomy (breast removal) and reconstruction in a single surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson recalled that her aunt had been diagnosed with the same type of breast cancer and faced multiple complications after her mastectomy. She was open to an alternative, and six months after her diagnosis, McPherson decided total breast reconstruction was a “no-brainer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Combining the two procedures allows for the removal of breast tissue and rebuilding the breast immediately, instead of doing two separate operations. The surgeon places the breast implants between the chest muscles to provide added stability, helping reduce the risk of distortion, movement, infection and fluid buildup. By avoiding the need to cut through or lift muscle, it can also lessen pain, speed recovery, and create a more natural breast shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Medical personnel use a mammogram to examine a woman's breast for breast cancer.

That delay often heightens the emotional distress of a breast cancer treatment while the patient waits to regain her breast shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Compared to traditional mastectomy, the immediate impact of total breast reconstruction is, as Piccinini told ABC News, "better results, lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays and reduced overall costs." He added that the procedure is covered by most insurance plans, making it more accessible to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“The first day after surgery, I was up and walking,” McPherson said. “I was back to work within six weeks.” She credits her quick recovery to the ease of the surgery, and active lifestyle, and the care she received at Montefiore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“I am 100% happy with my results,” McPherson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The two-for-one approach represents a notable shift in breast cancer surgery, said Piccinini. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Improving a patient’s physical appearance after breast cancer treatment can have a powerful ripple effect.

So it’s a common thing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b42c3a" class="body-graf"&gt;Chronic constipation can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5976340/" target="_blank"&gt;severely impact&lt;/a&gt; people’s lives and limit their physical abilities, worsening their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11532788/#jgh370042-sec-0020" target="_blank"&gt;quality of life and work productivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a1d5ee" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re chronically constipated, you may not be able to even participate in physical activity, because you feel bloated, you’re in pain, you’re achy, it may affect your mood,” said Anderson-Haynes, who also owns 360 Girls and Women, a nutrition and health practice based in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-183804" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is chronic constipation treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cfe66e" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. William Chey, professor of gastroenterology at the University of Michigan and incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology, said most studies on treating chronic constipation have focused on fiber supplements, like psyllium, and medications, like bisacodyl, senna and amitiza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e44c9f" class="body-graf"&gt;He added American guidelines “focus pretty heavily on medical therapies for chronic constipation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e42409" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gi.org/topics/constipation-and-defection-problems/" target="_blank"&gt;Traditional constipation treatments&lt;/a&gt; include increasing fiber intake through foods like prunes and other fruits and vegetables, drinking more water, and using different kinds of laxatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-991acc" class="body-graf"&gt;While the new guidelines include certain fiber-rich foods and fiber supplements, there’s no guidance on a “high-fiber diet” overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1e9420" class="body-graf"&gt;“When we were building these guidelines, and looking at the literature, we were expecting a lot more evidence on a high-fiber diet, and there simply isn’t enough in constipation,” Dimidi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c2955" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s plenty of evidence that a high-fiber diet is very beneficial for our overall health and also for elements of gut health, such as reducing the risk of colorectal cancer,” she added. “But when it comes to constipation, specifically, we just don’t have enough evidence to say that it improves constipation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d8156f" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the new recommendations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-94ace4" class="body-graf"&gt;Chey, who wasn’t involved with the new guidelines, said the recommendations “provide a valuable road map to things that [people] can try as they’re waiting to see their primary care physician.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e07c0b" class="body-graf"&gt;He added that people with more severe cases of constipation may need to see a gastroenterologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5476a9" class="body-graf"&gt;The recommendations include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-a0beb2" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber supplements: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements, such as psyllium, per day can improve stool frequency and consistency and aid in reducing straining. Fiber supplements should be slowly introduced and dosage gradually increased.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probiotics: Certain strains of probiotics, including, &lt;em&gt;B. lactis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bacillus coagulans&lt;/em&gt; Unique IS2, may help some people with symptoms. If taking one, patients should take a supplement of their choice and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for at least four weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium oxide supplements: 0.5-1.5 grams daily can help with stool frequency and consistency, reduce symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain and improve overall quality of life. Dosage should start at 0.5 grams per day and be gradually increased weekly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kiwis: Three daily, with or without the skin, can help improve stool frequency but not consistency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rye bread: Six to eight slices of rye bread per day can also aid stool frequency, but not consistency. The authors noted that this amount may not be realistic for some people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High mineral-content water: In combination with other treatments, 0.5-1.5 liters per day of high mineral-content water may also help. One of the key minerals in high mineral-content water, magnesium, is a known laxative. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc9cdb" class="body-graf"&gt;The one recommendation that gives Chey pause is for probiotics. “People’s microbiomes ... vary a lot from location to location based on diet, based on genetics, based on the environment, and so it’s very hard to make any generalizable statements about the use of specific probiotics,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-488116" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, overall, he said, “I think these kinds of recommendations are going to be very helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3d2a9" class="body-graf"&gt;Dimidi said she hopes the release of the guidelines can “empower” those with chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25ea91" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We’re hoping [the guidance] means that clinicians are very well-informed and can provide personalized advice to their patients that is very effective,” she said. “But also that people themselves with constipation can access now evidence-based information, feel empowered to take control of the symptoms and improve a condition that has a tremendous impact on quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 21:12:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPUTBOTnVzMlZaZ3hadHBZYWZVbzRoZnRyMC1sSVE5MDRMTU1FVk5STjhVYTNqQjlGMUJIYzNaNE1xSVRjOWdMUW1VdEYzUjlRMG56SGVhSEZCNUd3Y2VTeDFZOWp6OFRfS2JOVzFseDJoSV93UlJJOXZZckNJaUJXbkdDM2R0VHk0MnAwcmdTVGpTUFNmX1Q1ZEpJejBfRFB5NnFxX3JFSmhWRGN00gFWQVVfeXFMTTltVU5SQ2JVdDc2RUFWQlR3TE5ZMS10V0FacFcySTkxc0ZmRTZtOWtGRm1FdDVDV0ZiZXJ6UmEydGVmTWtNeFVzbXlla2tvTnR0bnI5dGc</guid></item><item><title>150多名未接种疫苗的儿童在SC麻疹爆发中隔离了21天- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/over-150-unvaccinated-kids-quarantined-for-21-days-in-sc-measles-outbreak/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Health officials in South Carolina are warning that the highly infectious measles virus is spreading undetected in communities in the northern part of the state, specifically Spartanburg and Greenville counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, officials in Greenville identified an eighth measles case that is potentially linked to the outbreak. Seven outbreak cases had been confirmed since September 25 in neighboring Spartanburg, where transmission was identified in two schools: Fairforest Elementary and Global Academy, a public charter school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across those two schools, at least 153 unvaccinated children were exposed to the virus and have been put in a 21-day quarantine, during which they are barred from attending school, state officials said in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baOoDM-Bn2g"&gt;a press conference&lt;/a&gt;. Twenty-one days is the maximum incubation period, spanning from when a person is exposed to when they would develop a rash if infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how the latest case in Greenville became infected with the virus and how they may link to the nearby Spartanburg cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What this case tells us is that there is active, unrecognized community transmission of measles occurring in the Upstate [northern region of South Carolina], which makes it vital to ensure that the public have received their measles vaccinations," the South Carolina Department of Public Health said in &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/dph-confirms-states-11th-measles-case-greenville-county-eighth-related-current-outbreak"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two recommended doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine are about 97 percent effective at blocking the infection, and that protection is considered lifelong. Without that protection, the virus is extremely contagious, infecting 90 percent of unvaccinated people who are exposed. The virus spreads easily through the air, lingering in the airspace of a room for up to two hours after an infected person has left.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic helped fuel the growth of vaccine politicization across the country, less than 1% of Austin school district’s kindergarteners in the fall of 2019 failed to comply with the state’s vaccine reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years later, the Austin Independent School District had some of the state’s highest number of kindergarteners who neglected those state requirements — about 1 in 5 kindergarteners had not proven they were fully vaccinated against measles and did not file an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Texas Tribune analysis has found that this explosion of vaccine non-compliance has played out across many school districts in the state in recent years, helping to push Texas’ measles vaccine coverage to the lowest it’s been since at least 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We definitely were on a better trajectory (before the pandemic),” said Alana Bejarano, executive director of health services and nursing for the Austin school district, which reported a 23% delinquency rate for the measles vaccines among their kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know that I can pinpoint the concrete answer, except (preschool and kindergarteners) were born at a time where everything kind of went off track and getting them back into that, you know, that’s been difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Tribune examined kindergarten measles vaccination compliance because it’s the earliest the state documents school vaccination rates and measles can be especially deadly for young children. The state’s two measles deaths this year were girls ages 6 and 8. Under Texas vaccine requirements, most kindergarteners must show they are fully vaccinated against measles or file an exemption to enroll in school; most who are not fully vaccinated have an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, the statewide measles vaccine delinquency rate — a term the Texas Department of State Health Services uses to track students not compliant with those requirements — more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The Tribune estimated the number of vaccine-delinquent kindergarteners in each district by comparing delinquency rates and enrollment totals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In school districts with the most delinquent kindergarteners in the 2024-25 school year, the latest data available from the state, as much as 44% of their kindergarteners were delinquent in the measles vaccines, and their delinquencies also outnumbered exemptions, which was not the case at the state level. Those school districts had vaccine delinquency rates as small as a fraction of a percent just five years prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five other vaccinations required for kindergarten followed similar increases in delinquency rates during the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic is the driving force behind the increase in vaccine delinquency, school district officials say. Many children are entering school after falling behind on their immunizations during the pandemic, making it an untenable task for resource-strapped school districts to chase after parents to vaccinate their children or submit an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, access to vaccines, especially free and low-cost doses, have also dwindled over the last several years amid funding cuts and the politicization of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;State laws and rules don’t dictate who has to enforce vaccine compliance, although the Texas Department of State Health Services administers the law and school districts have traditionally been among the first line of enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While school districts acknowledge they are enrolling students not compliant with state vaccine requirements, district officials say they are caught in a no-win situation. Pushing vaccines too hard could lead to retaliation from groups and politicians opposed to vaccine mandates, and district officials don’t want to disenroll students — public schools have a responsibility to educate all children and so much of their funding is tied to attendance, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We encourage our school nurses to advocate strongly to promote and protect public health at their campus,” Becca Harkleroad, executive director of the Texas School Nurse Organization. “But ultimately it’s up to the superintendent and the principal to decide how strictly they are going to enforce it or if they are going to enforce it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, the percentage of kindergarteners who were delinquent in getting the measles vaccine more than doubled to 2.68% between 2019-20 and 2024-25, the latest data available. The delinquency rate jumped to 3.1% in 2021-22, surpassing the number of students who had an exemption. Those rates have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, although the exemption rate has returned to exceeding the delinquency rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that a year ago 25,000 Texas kindergarteners were not fully vaccinated against measles. Of those, more than 16,000 had an exemption, and about 9,000 did not have an exemption and under the state’s definition, were vaccine delinquent.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The overall vaccine delinquency rates may be small, but anything that causes vaccination levels to fall means more children are vulnerable. Ideally, schools try to keep their vaccination levels at 95% to help protect those children with compromised immune systems or medical conditions that keep them from being vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to vaccine delinquency, the state also tracks the percentage of students who are vaccinated, formally exempt from vaccinations, and provisionally enrolled because of vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most unvaccinated students in Texas are permitted to enroll because they have an exemption form or a note from a doctor. They can also provisionally enroll without proving vaccination status if they are homeless, military dependents or in foster care and their records cannot be obtained by the start of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas measles kindergarten vaccination rate of 93% is the lowest it’s been since at least 2011, ranking the state 18th nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The decrease in vaccination rates overall is certainly a concern because it leaves our population vulnerable to different infections,” said Dr. Erin Nicholson, a pediatric infection physician at Texas Children’s Hospital and an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine. “And we saw that front and center with the measles outbreak that recently happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Schools: A first line of defense against infectious disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time most children enter kindergarten, they have received two MMR vaccination doses, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bswhealth.com/conditions/measles-rubeola/mmr-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;which will provide lifelong protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against measles, as well as mumps and rubella for most people. The MMR vaccination for kindergarteners is considered one of the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;most important immunization targets by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials audit school vaccination records each year for accuracy, by sampling school district records, explains Chris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. But there is nothing in state rules that requires DSHS to enforce the vaccination requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the de facto enforcement has traditionally fallen to school districts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the state’s highest kindergarten measles delinquency rates were in larger school districts and charter networks: KIPP Texas Public Schools (44%), Spring ISD (30%), Austin ISD (23%), Dallas ISD (20%), and Houston ISD (7%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five public school systems with the highest counts made up more than half of all delinquent kindergartners in the state, despite enrolling less than 10% of the state’s public school kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some district officials, including Dallas, say they try to follow state requirements by sending home students who do not have completed vaccination requirements or an exemption. But, they enroll those students, contributing to the district’s vaccine delinquency rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Austin school district will also enroll the students who don’t meet vaccine requirements, but they wait to send those students home until their parents have been notified of their vaccine delinquency three times, Bejarano said. They can return once they have proof of vaccination or the exemption form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State data doesn’t track how many vaccine-delinquent students school districts send home. It also doesn’t reflect changes to vaccine delinquency later in the year because the data is based on surveys school districts submit in the first half of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some school districts say they try to send home students who don’t meet vaccine requirements, Houston ISD officials said they are keeping those students in the classroom. They, too, dedicate time and resources to track all students’ vaccination status and try to communicate information with parents about the need for staying up to date on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, they are “not excluding students from learning based on vaccine status,” according to a statement to the Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chanthini Thomas, a school nurse who retired from her job at Houston ISD’s Bellaire High School last summer, said the conflicting messages from the district, resource reductions and the yearlong chase to get vaccine paperwork in was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have little support,” she said. “Why would you say … that’s a requirement to any school for the state of Texas but then you put out a mandate from the district to say, don’t let immunizations prevent enrollment? And the reason is because they need the numbers, because the numbers were dwindling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other urban school districts, HISD is battling &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://perc.tamu.edu/blog/2025/06/texas-enrollment.html?utm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;declining enrollment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and the funding that comes with it — as more families move toward better job opportunities and lower housing costs in the suburbs or choose charter and private schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As school nurses have told the Tribune over the summer, school districts choose to enroll unvaccinated children so they can keep “butts in the seats” and the base amount of money they receive from state and local sources to educate each student — &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/28/texas-school-funding-explainer/#:~:text=When%20Texas%20school%20districts%20talk,meet%20each%20student%27s%20educational%20needs." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;about $6,160&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I see the school as being in a tough spot,” said Melissa Gilkey, a University of North Carolina professor who studies vaccine efforts at schools. “We work so hard to minimize absenteeism … that I do have some sympathy for that idea that it’s hard to exclude them for one health service.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIPP Texas Public Schools, a charter network with campuses across the state, declined an interview but insisted it was following the state immunization requirements. Its kindergarten measles vaccine delinquency rate was less than 1% in 2019 compared to 44% last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring ISD, north of Houston, reported last year that more than 30% of its kindergarteners were measles vaccine delinquent. The district informed the Tribune it also follows state rules closely but said its high MMR delinquency rate was evidence of “enrollment and access issues” and that Spring ISD was “actively working to strengthen this process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spring district cited family’s frequent moves in the area, limited access to health care and language barriers as reasons there’s a delay in getting student shot records updated in time for school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are committed to improving compliance rates and ensuring our students are protected against preventable diseases,” said Shane Strubhart, the Spring ISD spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Access to vaccines has dwindled&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic disrupted preventive health care, becoming most apparent in some of the most recent kindergarten classes, filled with students born around the first COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic not only interrupted home and school life, experts say, it upended regular health checkups younger children typically receive before they start school and that impact continues to be felt today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families “going to see the doctors got off track for everyone during the pandemic,” Austin ISD’s Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For low-income and immigrant families who already found health care access a challenge, more are struggling to find what Bejarano calls their “medical” home, a regular primary care doctor who can either vaccinate their children or answer concerns and perhaps direct them to the state’s exemption process if they feel strong enough to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID didn’t do vaccination or education and many other things as a whole, any favors,” said Jennifer Finley, executive director of health services for Dallas ISD. The district’s kindergarten measles delinquency rate jumped to 20% last school year compared to 1% during the 2019-20 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diminished vaccine access is also a factor. Up until the early aughts, public health departments, churches and even lawmakers would hold free or low-cost immunization clinics over the summer for families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the Dallas school district turned away hundreds of students, who walked and drove to nearby clinics for free or low-cost vaccines, according to a Dallas Morning News article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic, those resources are even fewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really stopped during the pandemic,” Finley said. “Some of the folks lost their funding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools rely heavily on local public health departments to help them with vaccination clinics. Once the threat of COVID lessened, public health departments used those funds to add more staff and hold more vaccination clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two things began &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/18/texas-school-vaccination-budget-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;impacting vaccination efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by local health departments. First, those leftover funds were clawed back early by the Trump administration this year, prompting some staff to look for other jobs, thereby causing staff shortages in public health vaccination departments. And second, public health officials suspect more immigrant families are shying away from vaccination because of stepped-up immigration efforts and deportations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Texas, there are an &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/18/texas-border-schools-donald-trump-mass-deportations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated 111,000 immigrant children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, all of whom do not qualify for state Medicaid health insurance coverage, attending school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We typically have big lines and the waiting room is packed. Our whole lobby is packed,” Dr. Phil Huang, the director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, told the Tribune in August. “This year it has not been that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine hesitancy changing school messaging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic, many parents watched as debates raged over the safety of the quickly-developed COVID-19 vaccine. As a result, they are asking more questions about all childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, parents are spreading MMR doses out and that, too, could be the reason for more kindergartners showing up with an incomplete vaccination status, Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main concern (among parents) is basically, ‘Am I doing the right thing for my child, that is in their best interest and help me understand what the risks are of these infectious diseases that vaccines are trying to prevent,’” Nicholson, the Texas Children’s physician, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before COVID, many doctors adopted an imperial tone — “you should do this because I’m the expert,” she said. That changed after the pandemic. “We are looking at how we talk to these parents, because the last thing that we want to do is come across as condescending.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School nurses have also worked tirelessly to try to find a winning formula to reach families of vaccine-delinquent kids. At a national school nurse conference in Austin this summer, an entire session was devoted to teaching nurses how to have tension-free conversations with parents who are skeptical of vaccine requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, school nurses just want to inform parents of their two options to stay compliant with state rules: either provide proof of vaccination or an exemption, Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve made these large campaigns and we are really kind when they register, letting them know what is the law, what the exemptions (are),” Bejarano said. “I just think the district in general is understanding we need to do better when it comes to public health and getting these rates up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news, she says, is that the greater efforts made by school nurses in the fall to try to help parents become vaccine compliant tends to push down the high delinquency rates by the end of the school year. Data provided to the Tribune by Austin ISD proved that out. That 23% delinquency rate for kindergartners recorded in the fall of 2024 fell drastically to 6% by May 2025 possibly due to the fear produced by the measles outbreak in the months prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think that everybody came together in the Austin community and really did try to push for that” compliance, Bejarano said. “And I think that’s why it helped the rate last year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finley points to other lesser-known reasons complicating the back-to-school vaccination picture. Among them, an influx of students came to Texas from other states, many already armed with vaccination exemptions or with incomplete vaccination histories who are having to be re-educated about Texas requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting Sept. 1, Texas parents can more easily obtain a vaccine exemption form by downloading it off the state’s website, but how that will impact the delinquency gap won’t be seen until data is released next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicholson, Finley, Bejarano and others say they would like to see more data that clearly explains the rising delinquency rate and how many students who were once marked delinquent end up becoming fully vaccinated or obtaining an exemption by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Does it mean, you know, people are just struggling with paperwork?” Nicholson said. “Or does it mean that really those vaccinations are falling?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Texas Tribune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many forms of cancer are devastating. But pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly and aggressive forms there is. There are several reasons for this, including its stealthy progression, rapid metastasis (the way it spreads), and late detection. In fact, early detection is so rare there's a five-year survival rate of 13.3%. Over 80% of patients die due to metastatic progression within two years of diagnosis. But scientists may have discovered a way to slow it all down by studying a receptor that normally helps cancer cells spread, called ALK7. This is explained in a report published in &lt;a href="https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-025-02384-w" target="_blank"&gt;Molecular Cancer&lt;/a&gt;.  Interconnected ALK7-driven pathways typically promote pancreatic cancer cells, or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To really understand what's going on, you have to look at two concepts related to cancerous tumors, called extravasation and intravasation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The term extravasation describes a general leak of fluids or substances from human blood vessels into surrounding tissues. It can mean blood, medication, or, in this case, the cancerous cells. It's a multi-stage process through which most cancers spread. But to do that, cells must first bypass a fleshy barrier of sorts. Intravasation describes that process: the invasion of those cells through the basement membrane (or wall) of a blood vessel. The tumor cells breach the fibrotic stroma and vascular barriers, and once they're through, they can propagate using extravasation much more efficiently, thereby traveling to remote parts of the body, including other organs. But by leveraging ALK7 receptors and turning them off, scientists believe they can stop these two processes, thus stopping the spread of cancer. If true, that could lead to higher survival rates, better treatments, and maybe even a method to prevent late-stage progression altogether. In some ways, it's not unlike a &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/revolutionary-new-one-second-cancer-treatment-could-replace-radiation/" target="_blank"&gt;revolutionary new one-second cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; that could potentially replace radiation, currently a core treatment for most cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;Koto_feja/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Scientists have actually known about the ALK7 pathways for a time. Some studies have shown them to be anti-metastatic, and others the opposite, pro-metastatic, meaning there are arguments it either supports or prevents progression. The scientists studying the ALK7 pathways in the Molecular Cancer study believe that discrepancy is because of variations in either the different types of cancer or the differences in how the various studies were carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate, scientists injected PDAC cells into the pancreas of five-to-six week-old immunodeficient NSG mice and then administered inhibitors of "ALK family receptors" — ALK7 among them — and monitored tumor growth for three weeks. The findings suggest there is a way to reduce or stunt tumor growth using these pathways. But, of course, further testing will be necessary, and if those prove successful, rigorous development and then clinical trials are in order before anything usable is produced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not the first time a previously known factor was revisited by researchers. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/ai-helped-design-an-innovative-new-cancer-treatment-plan/" target="_blank"&gt;AI solutions have helped design an innovative cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; plan, and it's one that uses available drugs — the kind used to treat high cholesterol and alcohol dependence. AI is also helping to improve &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/mindblowing-ai-breakthrough-can-detect-cancer-99-of-the-time/" target="_blank"&gt;cancer detection with a 99% accuracy rate&lt;/a&gt;, and that's absolutely mindblowing. It means aggressive and deadly forms of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, could be spotted early before they're debilitating and dangerous. But rapid detection pales in comparison to the achievement of truly stopping the spread through treatment. It's early to say, but the ALK7 discovery could prove revolutionary for slowing PDAC.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The gut microbiota is the community of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes, that lives in our digestive systems—some of these microbes are helpful and others can be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many previous studies have shown that what we eat has an impact on our gut microbiota. Healthy diets rich in fruit, vegetables, fiber and nuts are strongly associated with increased microbial diversity and better stomach health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, for the first time, EPFL research has shown that the regularity with which we eat a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; is just as important for gut health as the amount of what we consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The importance of nutritional quality and regularity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a target="_blank"&gt;new paper, just&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63799-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;, researchers in EPFL's Digital Epidemiology Laboratory, part of both the Schools of Computer and Communication and Life Sciences, confirmed earlier research that certain types of foods, such as fruit and vegetables, contribute to a more diverse gut microbiota. Working with colleagues at the University of California, San Diego, they also made several striking new discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they found that it's not just the consumption of fruit, vegetables and grains that create a healthy gut microbiota, but whether you eat them regularly or not. While there's always been a hunch that it's important to eat good food regularly, encouraged by campaigns such as 'five fruits and vegetables a day," it has always been just that—a hunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research clearly shows that you cannot binge on vegetables on your healthy day and then eat in an unhealthy way for the rest of the week or month," said Associate Professor Marcel Salathé, head of the Digital Epidemiology Lab and co-director of the EPFL AI Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In fact, our study suggests that irregular consumption of healthy foods undoes many of their beneficial effects on the gut microbiota. This is a real incentive for future studies to not just look at what people are eating but the patterns of what they are eating over time."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Predicting diet from the microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the team was also able to show that a person's gut bacteria and what they eat can predict each other with up to 85% accuracy. With just a simple stool sample—an increasingly common component of medical research—advanced &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/machine+learning/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; techniques could predict a person's diet using their microbiota and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For our collaborators in San Diego, who are some of the world's leading experts in microbiome research, this was exciting," explained Salathé. "Getting such data from a stool sample is relatively easy, but understanding someone's diet is notoriously difficult, it's data that's been challenging to collect."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The power of real-time data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was made possible by using detailed nutritional information from about 1000 participants who were part of the &lt;a href="https://www.foodandyou.org/" target="_blank"&gt;"Food &amp;amp; You"&lt;/a&gt; cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-resolution dietary data was collected via the AI-powered app &lt;a href="https://www.myfoodrepo.ai/en" target="_blank"&gt;MyFoodRepo&lt;/a&gt;, developed by the same EPFL lab, which allowed users to log their meals in real time by snapping photos or scanning barcodes. The app's AI then analyzed these entries for nutritional content, later verified by human reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Historically, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nutrition+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nutrition research&lt;/a&gt; has relied on food frequency questionnaires and 24-hour dietary recalls. In theory, you could ask somebody to write down everything they eat but in practice it's just not done because it's borderline impossible. Now, the AI is so good that we can do this data collection at a large scale," said Rohan Singh, a Doctoral Assistant in the Digital Epidemiology Lab and lead author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study has been particularly interesting because when you look at lifestyle-oriented gastrointestinal disorders, they often develop gradually. Since nutrition is one of the big contributors to these diseases, analyses like ours may be able to assess what can be improved in a person's diet. AI can then help nudge people to adjust their food intake accordingly," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salathé believes the study's findings suggest that current dietary guidelines may need to be updated to emphasize not just the types and quantities of food, but the regularity of healthy eating behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, while this research project has ended, the MyFoodRepo app continues to be used by the Digital Epidemiology Lab team for other research. They are currently involved in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pilot+project/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pilot project&lt;/a&gt; on nutrition and cognitive performance, studying potential links between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, through the use of barcoded food data from the Food &amp;amp; You study, the researchers are investigating the link between food additives, like emulsifiers, found in ultra-processed foods, and the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiota/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a strong hypothesis that some of these additives really may negatively impact your microbiota, and we have some early indications that this could indeed be the case. We're still in the analysis stage but we are quite excited about early results," said Salathé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally, they are gratified that the MyFoodRepo app is now opening the door to important nutrition studies globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From the outset, we knew we needed something extremely consumer-friendly and easy to use, while still providing the data that we needed. We built it to serve our own research needs, but also in a way which others would find useful—and it's now being used in many other nutrition studies globally," Salathé concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

In a study of 481 individuals, those with dermatological symptoms such as rashes or itching were over three times more likely to report suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that skin issues could serve as an early biological marker of poor psychiatric outcomes, much like a warning sign in physical health. Scientists believe this connection may arise from shared developmental and inflammatory pathways between the brain and skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Suicide Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Around 25% of patients with skin symptoms experienced suicidal thoughts or attempts, compared to 7% without them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Origins:&lt;/strong&gt; The skin and brain both develop from the same embryonic tissue, potentially explaining their linked vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Dermatological symptoms may serve as early indicators of more severe mental health outcomes in psychosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;European College of Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have discovered that mental health patients who have skin conditions may be more at risk of worse outcomes, including &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=suicide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suicidality&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=depression" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work, which may aid in identifying at-risk patients and personalising psychiatric treatment, is presented at the ECNP meeting in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at 481 patients with a first episode of&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=psychosis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; psychosis&lt;/a&gt; (which is the first time an individual experiences a psychotic episode, such as loss of contact with reality, hallucinations and delusions). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113352"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc.jpg" alt="This shows a woman with a rash on her face." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The brain and the skin both derive from the same embryonic origin – the ectoderm – prompting the researchers to investigate the relation between the skin and mental health. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On testing, 14.5% were found to have dermatological symptoms (24% female, 9.8% male) such as rash, itching, photosensitivity, etc.  All patients were given 4 weeks treatment with an antipsychotic and then checked for a range of &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=mental+health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher, Dr Joaquín Galvañ &lt;em&gt;(Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Gregorio Marañón, &lt;/em&gt;Madrid) said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After 4 weeks of follow-up, patients with a first episode of psychosis presenting with skin conditions experienced higher levels of depression and risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that just 7% of the patients without the initial skin conditions had suicidal thoughts or attempts, in contrast, around 25% of the patients with initial skin conditions had suicidal thoughts or attempts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initial skin conditions are also linked to greater depression and poorer well-being at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This discovery suggests that the presence of skin conditions indicates that these patients are more at risk for worse outcomes than patients who do not have skin conditions after a first episode of psychosis&lt;em&gt;”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that, if confirmed, this finding has the potential to act as an advance marker for mental health risk, similar to the way, a blood test might indicate a greater risk of cancer or heart disease&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain and the skin both derive from the same embryonic origin – the ectoderm – prompting the researchers to investigate the relation between the skin and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr &lt;strong&gt;Galvañ&lt;/strong&gt; continued:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was already known that between 30% and 60% of people with skin conditions show psychiatric symptoms. What we have done is look at things from the opposite direction; do people with mental health problems have skin conditions, and if so, can this tell us anything useful?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our findings suggest that dermatological symptoms may represent a marker of illness severity and poor short-term outcomes in the early stages of psychosis, potentially identifying a subgroup of patients with a poorer clinical prognosis who may benefit from early tailored interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason for the connection is still unclear, but our working hypothesis is that this may be due to the skin and neurological systems having common developmental origins and inflammatory pathways; but this needs to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know this is the first study to show this link in patients with psychosis, so we need follow-up studies to confirm the finding. We also need to understand if this link applies also to a range of other psychiatric conditions, such as bipolar disorder, ADHD, anxiety or depression”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting, Professor Eric Ruhe (Professor of Difficult-to-Treat Depression at &lt;em&gt;Radboud University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the Netherlands) said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an interesting association between skin problems and a first episode of psychosis. These results need replication in different cohorts but might indeed show a new link between skin and psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As the skin and the brain derive from the same embryonic origin, this would worth pursuing further, both diagnostically and mechanistically (which may be more interesting). For example, this association might be used to culture skin cells to begin to understand which treatment is appropriate”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an independent comment, Professor Ruhe was not involved in this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760375327707"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers discover about psychosis and skin conditions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: They found that patients with skin issues during their first psychotic episode were far more likely to experience depression and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760375344444"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why might the skin and brain be connected in this way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Both originate from the same embryonic tissue (ectoderm) and share inflammatory and signaling pathways that may influence mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760375360588"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How could this finding change psychiatric care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Dermatological symptoms might help identify high-risk patients early, allowing for faster, more personalized interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ecnp.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tom Parkhill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ecnp.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European College of Neuropharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tom Parkhill – European College of Neuropharmacology&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at the 38th ECNP Congress&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 17:14:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQZnBHNGx3T0pHcWc5WTVxNzBkcVFvNXBsRDBaWGRQa1RFZlJxM2FyS3NGQUVwV3ZUSzJKOGQtcjVtcjJKNm5fZjE3TlhlM2VnOUZUdGxZdjNvUnNHVldoVlQ5NHZ0clZiYkt1Wk9ObGlLT09YYnYySWIwcTBjUzIwMlZfM2YxVEVX</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织警告耐药性感染急剧增加--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/health/who-antibiotic-drug-resistance.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 17:07:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOSW0yVm1TbzV0aXpSVTdWNzR6Q0gtaGdSVmpvZGJaQmVYSk5NYVMtV1BYV0F1Z3F4MHIwVlFKNlRYWEpRZzQ4MGlWMjdzZEMyWm5jcmRDSHNzX2E5eG1ybXpVODdJYnlOdmZKNlZoZ1VoSTJrRkp5ZDNLd3EyU2R2X3FqRQ</guid></item><item><title>心理学说， 8个迹象表明你比大多数同龄人衰老得更好- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/d-t-8-signs-youre-aging-better-than-most-of-your-peers-says-psychology/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="216" data-end="355"&gt;Aging well isn’t about how many candles are on your birthday cake. It’s about how you feel, how you think, and how you show up every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="357" data-end="488"&gt;Sure, genetics play a role. But psychology tells us that much of how we age comes down to our mindset, habits, and daily choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="490" data-end="592"&gt;So how do you know if you’re actually aging well—not just surviving but thriving as you get older?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="594" data-end="724"&gt;Let’s dive into eight signs that you’re aging better than most of your peers, according to research and a bit of lived experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="726" data-end="764"&gt;1) You’ve kept your curiosity alive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="766" data-end="888"&gt;Ever met someone who seems to have stopped learning at 25? Their conversations sound like reruns of the same TV episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="890" data-end="1076"&gt;Curiosity is one of the most underrated markers of psychological youth. Research from the Journal of Personality has linked curiosity with greater life satisfaction and even longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1078" data-end="1207"&gt;Curious people stay mentally flexible. They’re open to new experiences, which keeps the brain sharp and the spirit adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1209" data-end="1335"&gt;Whether that means trying a new cuisine, picking up a language, or diving into a topic you know nothing about—it all counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1337" data-end="1495"&gt;Personally, I’ve noticed that when I &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/z-if-you-can-still-do-these-7-things-after-75-youre-in-the-top-10-of-your-age-group/"&gt;stay curious&lt;/a&gt;—whether it’s exploring a new restaurant or reading something outside my usual interests—I feel more alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1497" data-end="1541"&gt;2) You focus more on health than on looks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1543" data-end="1671"&gt;Let’s be honest, most of us start hitting the gym in our 20s because we want to look good. But as we age, something changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1673" data-end="1857"&gt;You start caring less about six-pack abs and more about how you feel when you wake up. You begin to value your energy levels, mental clarity, and overall health more than aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1859" data-end="1973"&gt;That shift in mindset? It’s a sign of maturity—and according to psychology, a strong indicator of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1975" data-end="2153"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12181576/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that people who focus on intrinsic goals like wellness, purpose, and vitality tend to be happier and age more gracefully than those fixated on external validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2155" data-end="2223"&gt;You’re not giving up vanity—you’re just upgrading your priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2225" data-end="2267"&gt;3) You’ve learned to manage your stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2269" data-end="2378"&gt;If you’ve figured out how to keep your cool when life throws curveballs, congratulations—you’re aging well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2380" data-end="2644"&gt;Chronic stress accelerates biological aging by shortening something called telomeres (the protective caps on your DNA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2380" data-end="2644"&gt;Psychologists have found that people who develop coping mechanisms—like mindfulness, journaling, or exercise—essentially slow that clock down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2646" data-end="2738"&gt;Think about it: we all deal with chaos. The question is, how much of it do we internalize?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2740" data-end="2891"&gt;The older I get, the more I realize that peace isn’t about a calm environment—it’s about a calm mind. And that kind of calm only comes from practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2893" data-end="2929"&gt;4) You nurture your relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p data-start="2931" data-end="3165"&gt;Here’s a fascinating fact: Harvard’s &lt;a href="https://www.harvard.edu/in-focus/happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;longest-running study&lt;/a&gt; on happiness—spanning more than 80 years—found that the biggest predictor of long-term health and fulfillment isn’t wealth, career success, or even diet. It’s relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3167" data-end="3375"&gt;The quality of your social connections directly affects how well you age. People with close, supportive relationships tend to live longer, experience less cognitive decline, and recover faster from illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3377" data-end="3445"&gt;It makes sense. Humans are social creatures, wired for connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3447" data-end="3533"&gt;And let’s face it—good friends keep you laughing, which is pretty much free therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3535" data-end="3709"&gt;If you make time for people who energize you and distance yourself from those who drain you, you’re not just setting emotional boundaries—you’re extending your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3711" data-end="3749"&gt;5) You’ve made peace with your past&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3751" data-end="3826"&gt;You can’t age well if you’re still fighting battles that ended years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3828" data-end="4111"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11694412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; psychologists, unresolved regret or resentment can lead to chronic stress, anxiety, and even physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3828" data-end="4111"&gt;On the flip side, emotional acceptance—acknowledging your past without letting it define you—is one of the strongest predictors of psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4113" data-end="4254"&gt;Aging gracefully doesn’t mean pretending the past didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4113" data-end="4254"&gt;It means learning from it, forgiving yourself, and moving forward lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4256" data-end="4425"&gt;The older I get, the more I understand that &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/8-signs-youre-actually-a-very-difficult-person-according-to-psychology/"&gt;holding grudges&lt;/a&gt; is like carrying extra luggage on a long hike. You’ll get tired faster, and it’s just not worth the weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4427" data-end="4461"&gt;6) You keep your sense of humor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4463" data-end="4531"&gt;Ever noticed that people who can laugh at themselves seem ageless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4533" data-end="4612"&gt;A good sense of humor isn’t just charming—it’s a powerful psychological tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4614" data-end="4799"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8496883/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that humor helps reduce stress hormones, strengthens the immune system, and even improves memory in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4801" data-end="4902"&gt;But beyond the science, there’s something timeless about not taking life—or yourself—too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4904" data-end="5041"&gt;If you can find the funny side when things go sideways, you’re showing resilience and flexibility—two traits that define healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5043" data-end="5079"&gt;7) You’re comfortable with change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5081" data-end="5185"&gt;Remember how you used to resist change in your 20s because you thought you had everything figured out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5187" data-end="5247"&gt;Then life showed you that nothing stays the same for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5249" data-end="5492"&gt;People who age well aren’t necessarily the ones with the easiest lives—they’re the ones who adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5249" data-end="5492"&gt;Psychologists call this psychological flexibility, and it’s been linked to better &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/n-5-things-i-do-for-my-mental-health-in-my-50s-that-i-didnt-do-in-my-30s/"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; and emotional stability across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5494" data-end="5689"&gt;You might not love every transition, but you’ve learned to roll with them. Whether it’s a career shift, a breakup, or a move to a new city, you don’t cling to what was—you focus on what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5691" data-end="5758"&gt;That mindset doesn’t just make life smoother. It makes it richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5760" data-end="5793"&gt;8) You know what truly matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5795" data-end="5829"&gt;And finally, here’s the big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5831" data-end="5932"&gt;If you’ve started prioritizing meaning over metrics—depth over drama—you’re aging better than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5934" data-end="6186"&gt;Psychology calls this “self-transcendence”: the ability to see beyond the ego and focus on what gives life genuine purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5934" data-end="6186"&gt;People who cultivate this sense of meaning tend to experience more peace, gratitude, and fulfillment, even in difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6188" data-end="6326"&gt;Maybe that means spending more time with family, mentoring younger colleagues, or simply &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/m-the-quiet-rebellion-of-slowing-down/"&gt;slowing down&lt;/a&gt; to appreciate your morning coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6328" data-end="6488"&gt;Whatever it looks like for you, that shift from chasing “more” to appreciating “enough” is one of the clearest signs of emotional maturity and graceful aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6490" data-end="6508"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6510" data-end="6606"&gt;Aging well has less to do with anti-wrinkle creams or supplements and more to do with mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6608" data-end="6708"&gt;It’s about curiosity, adaptability, connection, and a sense of &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-if-you-want-to-protect-your-peace-keep-these-10-things-private-at-all-costs/"&gt;inner peace&lt;/a&gt; that deepens with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6710" data-end="6781"&gt;You can’t stop the clock—but you can decide how you meet each moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6783" data-end="6914"&gt;And maybe that’s the real secret: it’s not about staying young forever—it’s about growing older without losing your joy for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Working in mental health, I often have people telling me that they're on medication for their mental health, so they don't need therapy (and vice versa) when &lt;b&gt;the most effective treatment for mental illnesses is a &lt;a href="https://bestmindbh.com/blog/how-do-medications-and-psychotherapy-work-together-the-life-changing-benefits-of-combining-medication-and-therapy/" target="_blank"&gt;combination&lt;/a&gt; of therapy and medication.&lt;/b&gt; For the bulk of people, they won't need to be on medication forever, either; it's just to help them through this tough stage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, 31, Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;b&gt;Severe mental illness is unlikely to be 'cured.'&lt;/b&gt; Recovery is not a black and white thing. Recovery is a gradual thing that looks different for each person. It could be unrealistic to expect your loved one, or yourself, to live exactly the same life as before the onset. But it's also unrealistic to think life with a severe mental illness can't be active and rewarding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, Early 30s, California&lt;/p&gt;

And that's why taking magnesium oxide supplements was found to have lots of benefits, according to the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;These included reducing lower tummy pain, bloating, straining - and making it easier to poo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Regarding probiotics, the guidelines suggest some types can improve some symptoms but there is also a lack of research on the impact of many different probiotic strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Up until now, guidance for doctors treating patients with constipation has been limited and outdated, and focused on advice to increase dietary fibre and water intake, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The new recommendations are based on evidence from 75 clinical trials - all those available - which have been analysed by a panel of experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Kevin Whelan, senior research author and professor of dietetics at KCL, said the new guidance "marks a promising step towards empowering health professionals and their patients to manage constipation through diet". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He said this meant people suffering from constipation could now access up-to-date advice to help improve their symptoms, wellbeing and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The British Dietetic Association, which funded the project to produce the new guidelines, said they were an excellent resource for dietitians, doctors and nurses, and supported "a more diet-focused and evidence-based approach to the management of chronic constipation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The research and the new guidelines are published in the Journal of Human Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:24:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9iRUsyVkVYNnBRUFlTSjBWb3h4VHd5aWNWMHliNlhOUUhFVFlOTF9QWHlpajBCY0pna0FMRVh1SUJUNWFUU1QxYnBWb2xmRXNVODN4TVlYeGlDQdIBX0FVX3lxTE5MMVIySjNOVkRoYlU1MGZob0RxbzdaSXlwa3J1WDBDcEY5eVlMdGFnOWQtNEp0SE5SX09scGhLZ1F3eVktbGJSVjYzbFFiRU9oNDR3RmdWT0NhQ2JyallB</guid></item><item><title>与大麻使用相关的基因揭示了与心理健康的关系-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/genetics-cannabis-mental-health-29804/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers analyzing data from over 130,000 participants have identified specific genes associated with cannabis use and its frequency, revealing strong links to psychiatric, cognitive, and physical health traits. The genes CADM2 and GRM3, already known for roles in brain communication and impulsivity, appear central to how individuals initiate and sustain cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also uncovered dozens of other genes tied to risk-taking, schizophrenia, and chronic illnesses such as diabetes and coronary artery disease. These findings could lead to new prevention strategies and potential therapeutic targets for cannabis use disorder, which currently has no approved drug treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Key Genes:&lt;/strong&gt; Cannabis use is linked to CADM2 and GRM3, genes involved in brain signaling and impulsivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Health Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Genetic predisposition for cannabis use overlaps with over 100 psychiatric, cognitive, and physical traits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform personalized strategies to predict and prevent cannabis use disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of California San Diego of Medicine researchers, in collaboration with the genetic testing company 23andMe, have identified regions of the human genome associated with cannabis use, uncovering new relationships with psychiatric, cognitive and physical health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings may inform the development of prevention and treatment strategies for cannabis use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113344"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain, DNA, and leaves." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;There are currently no FDA-approved drug therapies to treat cannabis use disorder. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published on October 13, 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis is widely used, but its long-term effects on health remain poorly characterized,” said Sandra Sanchez-Roige, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also interested in the relationship between genetics and traits that contribute to the development of cannabis use disorder, which can interfere with a person’s daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most people who try cannabis do not go on to develop cannabis use disorder, some studies estimate that nearly 30% will,” said Sanchez-Roige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the genetics of early-stage behaviors may help clarify who is at greater risk, opening the door to prevention and intervention strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyzing relationships between cannabis use and genetic data provided by 131,895 23andMe research participants. They answered survey questions about whether or not they had ever used cannabis, and those who answered yes were also asked how frequently they used the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known for decades that genetic factors influence whether or not people will try drugs, how frequently they use those drugs, and the risk that they will become addicted to them,” said Abraham A. Palmer, Ph.D., professor and vice chair for basic research in the department of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genetic tools like GWAS help us identify the molecular systems that connect cannabis use to brain function and behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that lifetime cannabis use was associated with two genes. The first was Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (&lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt;), a gene involved in cell assembly and in signaling between nerve cells, particularly in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked &lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt; to various traits and conditions, including impulsive personality, obesity and cancer metastasis. Frequency of cannabis use was also found to be associated with the &lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second gene was Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 3 (&lt;em&gt;GRM3&lt;/em&gt;), which is involved in communication between neurons and long-term brain plasticity. &lt;em&gt;GRM3&lt;/em&gt; has already been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that the genetics of cannabis use — both trying it and using it more often — are tied to the genetics of other psychiatric traits, cognitive measures, and even physical health problems,” said Sanchez-Roige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secondary analysis revealed an additional 40 genes associated with lifetime cannabis use and four genes associated with frequency of cannabis use. Twenty-nine of these genes had not previously been associated with cannabis-related traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then analyzed which health conditions were correlated with a genetic predisposition for cannabis use. They analyzed thousands of traits in two large independent datasets from the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) &lt;em&gt;All of Us Research Program&lt;/em&gt; and Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the genome, lifetime cannabis use and frequency of cannabis use were genetically correlated with more than 100 different traits including psychiatric conditions (e.g., schizophrenia, ADHD, anxiety and depression), cognitive traits (e.g., executive function and risk-taking) and physical health (e.g., diabetes, chronic pain and coronary artery disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were also associated with an increased risk for tobacco use, infectious diseases including HIV and viral hepatitis, and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is one of the first genome-wide association studies to examine behaviors that precede cannabis use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis use exists on a continuum,” said first author Hayley Thorpe, Ph.D., a visiting scholar in Sanchez-Roige’s lab and postdoctoral researcher at Western University. “By studying these intermediate traits, we can begin to map how genetic risk unfolds before cannabis use disorder develops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently no FDA-approved drug therapies to treat cannabis use disorder. The authors hope that the biological discoveries generated by GWAS will support future efforts to identify therapeutic targets and preventative interventions against the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional co-authors on the study include: John J.

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of marine mammals, the researchers say it appears that Alzheimer's-type neuropathology and disorientation may result from "chronic exposure" to toxic molecules produced by cyanobacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies of villagers on the Pacific island of Guam show that chronic dietary exposure to cyanobacterial toxins is associated with misfolded tau proteins and amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say the cyanobacterial toxin BMAA, as well as 2,4-Diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB), and N-2-aminoethylglycine (AEG), have been found to be extremely toxic to neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They explained that BMAA triggers Alzheimer’s-like neuropathology and cognitive loss in animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toxins can be "biomagnified" up the food chain in the marine ecosystem, according to research published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/commsbio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of 20 common &lt;a href="https://talker.news/2024/10/16/scientists-detect-microplastics-in-dolphins-breath-for-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bottlenose dolphins&lt;/a&gt; stranded in the Indian River Lagoon in eastern Florida showed that their brains contained BMAA and 2,4-DAB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-default"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-06daf692-87e6-5fc5-90b9-b195578a743a" data-instance="#gallery-items-9416e610-8a7d-5bad-ad48-db1521eca899-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-9416e610-8a7d-5bad-ad48-db1521eca899"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are thousands of different types of chili peppers, with some estimates suggesting over 4,000 varieties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 2020 study, the researchers noted that the type of chili pepper and amount consumed was variable among the studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research involved a meta‑analysis of four large observational studies comparing people who consumed chili pepper vs. those who rarely or never did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The individual studies were based on self‑reported diet and chili consumption (not controlled interventions), and the amount, type, or frequency of chili pepper use was not standardized across the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This made it difficult to draw conclusions about exactly how much, how often and which type of chili pepper consumption may be associated with health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author Dr Bo Xu, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic's Heart, Vascular &amp;amp; Thoracic Institute in Cleveland, Ohio, said at the time that the findings highlighted that 'dietary factors may play an important role in overall health'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'The exact reasons and mechanisms that might explain our findings, though, are currently unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, it is impossible to conclusively say that eating more chili pepper can prolong life and reduce deaths, especially from cardiovascular factors or cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'More research, especially evidence from randomized controlled studies, is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has suggested regularly eating chilis may protect against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Previous studies have found the food has an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer and blood-glucose regulating effect due to capsaicin, which gives chili pepper its characteristic spice (stock) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate 2020 study in mice by scientists in Canada found that feeding them treats made with capsaicin protected against the formation of amyloid plaques, the harmful deposits thought to be responsible for the symptoms of Alzheimer’s, including memory loss and mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal Translational Psychiatry, the researchers said, as well as blocking plaque formation, capsaicin appeared to dampen down inflammation in the brain, also linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chili peppers aren't the first or only food Johnson promotes. He is also a big advocate of extra virgin olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He&lt;span&gt; has said he consumes a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil with every meal, every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The 48-year-old (pictured, right, with his son) claims to be more than a decade younger biologically than his actual age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a YouTube video the health influencer listed what the criteria is to meet the standards for extra virgin olive oil to be beneficial for health, with it needing to be cold pressed, containing polyphenols, oleic acid, third-party testing, harvest date and UV protectant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Healthline, extra virgin olive oil is nutritious and contains powerful antioxidants, as well as strong anti-inflammatory properties and may help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and fight Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you eat it causes damage in your body,' Johnson explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I recently learned it myself, and so EVOO is protective against that damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Studies show improvements in weight management, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, cholesterol, heart health, brain health and mood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He claimed: 'The scientific evidence is compelling, [and] extra virgin olive oil is in an elite category.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:38:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOdUZUYXhOZWtYVDc1Qmljb0RUZmc4UFFxYjQzVXJmSzdia0VGY0RFQzF4aUVNSk9YVDNQTzdXV3AycWJTNThzVGVUS2JIbWhBNmppdl9ZeFI1amtpdURTeXlramFPMmFEcjB3dXI5X1NnZUFkQXR5N281djd0elpNb0VNS19hb2h1X1ZsYmUwYjlyekdvczJLOUJ3OEdLOHI3amRpMC04RdIBrAFBVV95cUxNWVhSSXJnbjJ0bWtsQ25YU25YcjRpdldpUEVTTklkNDJsYkQ5QUlRczh1THZZaE0yTVU4dnlIQmRLTFd5bldYNEJoRXhHbGhIdklzQnB0Vk1rWk9hM0o0MVdSZWhaQVZfVlo5Q1FLeng3enFIRDlBQ1Vwa3BoLU5zaU5FVjJHRXBRRFI3bDNwMUNkWm1vTTBMYWFwZ1ZMc1I5bDJDbktLTUpoWTND</guid></item><item><title>科学家们启动了$ 1420万的项目来解码人体的“隐藏的第六感” -SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-begin-14-2-million-project-to-decode-the-bodys-hidden-sixth-sense/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:27:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOQUNTUGw5N2JHeG1nWjVnYWl3Q2ZCal8tQ1lxUnNvdmhlaE0xSFZ4aXVYX0pnMlFYY0NPMXV0bUxfY0laclZBTGM2SHpOUTI5bHlUQkZCTFBkTE5aS0NxWGpJd01jWHI1Sjc2UHBkSWtTMXFqLUZaNUtCRHZQSzVWNVh6di0xVDIyb1RORC1LWjdiSWpHeFZwUm5mTmpTQ2JrQnRKaQ</guid></item><item><title>为什么人们使用大麻或对大麻上瘾？一项新的研究提供了线索。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/13/cannabis-marijuana-addiction-genes-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7AD2W4E55NB2LFDDRAKNJOYWV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The tendency to use cannabis is associated with genes linked to impulsive behavior, obesity, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, among other traits, according to a study released Monday by researchers at the University of California at San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:17:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQQTYtakE3U3Q1d2dFaXBQWG94Mjg0ZEt4Q1ptZlJZNkV5RVItT0VveGg0ZXYyWHg0bXVib3FyZ0x3M0p1RHBpQTdRTFBfNGdhSTZnYzRXNVhaRDBUQk9oZkgwb2d2OVZfZFl3eXdqX3VWV1pocWRRcWN5SUhGNjAwZWM1ZHJqYjEtVnJUZ0RwZXlmZUxI</guid></item><item><title>一项研究显示，使用社交媒体的孩子在阅读和记忆测试中的得分较低- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/13/nx-s1-5571050/social-media-teens-brains-reading-memory</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Preteens using increasing amounts of social media perform poorer in reading, vocabulary and memory tests in early adolescence compared with those who use no or little social media. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's according to a new study that suggests a link between social media use and poorer cognition in teens. The &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.16613?guestAccessKey=c8bce59a-f799-4c36-817e-dd2c05cf6ae4&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=101325" target="_blank"&gt;findings are published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is a really exciting study," says psychologist &lt;a href="https://mitch.web.unc.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Mitch Prinstein&lt;/a&gt; at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wasn't involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It confirms a lot of what we have been hearing about from schools all across the country, which is that kids are just having a really hard time focusing on being able to learn as well as they used to, because of the ways in which social media has changed their ability to process information, perhaps."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most previous research has focused on the impact of social media use on kids' mental health, "it's critical to understand how social media use during school hours specifically affects learning, especially as so many schools are considering phone bans right now," says study author and pediatrician &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jason.nagata" target="_blank"&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/a&gt; of the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A look at reading and memory &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand that, Nagata and his colleagues used data from one of the largest ongoing studies on adolescents, called the &lt;a href="https://abcdstudy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists have been following thousands of preteens as they go through adolescence to understand the development of their brains.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The ongoing study has been surveying kids about their social media use every year and giving them a range of tests for learning and memory every other year. Nagata and his colleagues used data on over 6,000 children, ages 9 to 10, as scientists followed them through early adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They classified the kids into three groups based on their evolving patterns of social media use. The biggest group, consisting of about 58% of the kids, used little or no social media over the next few years. The second-largest group, about 37% of kids, started out with low-level use of social media, but by the time they turned 13, they were spending about an hour each day on social media. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The remaining 6% of kids — called the "high increasing social media group" — were spending about three or more hours a day by age 13.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"The dosage effect"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All the groups were given a range of tests to measure their cognitive functioning at the start of the study and in early adolescence. For example, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7659464/" target="_blank"&gt;oral reading recognition test&lt;/a&gt; examined their reading and vocabulary skills. Another test, called the &lt;a href="https://nihtoolbox.org/test/picture-vocabulary-test/" target="_blank"&gt;picture vocabulary test&lt;/a&gt;, had them match the right pictures to words they heard.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What was notable actually to me and perhaps surprising was that even the low [increasing] social media users, so those who had about one hour a day by age 13, did perform on average 1 to 2 points lower on the reading and memory tasks compared to the non-social media users," says Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the high increasing group performed up to 4 to 5 points lower than the non-social media users.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So those who had the highest social media use have lower scores," notes Nagata, "but even the low users had smaller differences in their cognitive scores."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That really speaks to the dosage effect of these [apps]," says psychologist &lt;a href="https://madiganlab.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Sheri Madigan&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Calgary, who wrote an &lt;a href="https://media.jamanetwork.com/wp-content/handlers/downloader.php?a=119641" target="_blank"&gt;accompanying editorial &lt;/a&gt;for the study. "It's problematic at really high uses, but it's also problematic at even in small doses."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While a difference of a few points in test scores may seem insignificant, "it's important to understand that kids are a moving target," explains Prinstein, who is also &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/about/apa/senior-staff/prinstein-bio" target="_blank"&gt;chief of psychology strategy and integration&lt;/a&gt; at the American Psychological Association.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Even a slight change in what they look like after a short period of time means that they're kind of now pointed on a trajectory that is different from others. That means that two, three, five years from now, we might be talking about some very significant gaps between kids who might have been heavy users or not as heavy users."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/10/10-facts-about-teens-and-social-media/" target="_blank"&gt;other recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that hours on social media increase later in adolescence, notes Nagata. "We would expect that when they hit age 15, 16, 17, their use will be much higher," which might lead to even larger gaps in cognition and learning in later years, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In earlier studies, Nagata's team has used the same data from the ABCD Study and found other disturbing trends among underage social media users.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href="https://www.academicpedsjnl.net/article/S1876-2859(25)00009-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;found that a majority of kids&lt;/a&gt; — nearly two-thirds — start using social media before they turn 13, with the average user having three social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They also found &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9243697/" target="_blank"&gt;high levels of addiction-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; with smartphones among 10-to-14-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Half the kids who had smartphones said that they lose track of how much time they're using their phone," says Nagata. "A quarter who are using social media say they use social media to forget about their problems. And 11% say that social media use has negatively affected their schoolwork."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;An important time for brain development&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adolescence is a critical period for brain development, notes Prinstein, when the brain is fine-tuning its architecture based on experiences.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After the first year of life, the adolescent period is the time where we see the most growth and the biggest reorganization of the brain in our lifetimes," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2799812" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, Prinstein and his colleagues found that teens who are heavy social media users have brains that are more attuned to an existence on social media, with its "rapid, constant feedback," says Prinstein. "What we're finding is that kids become hypersensitive to the kinds of likes, comments, feedback and rewards they might get from peers."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those findings help explain the results of the new studies, he adds. "It makes perfect sense that if their brain is growing to be optimized for social media activities, it might not be optimized for other things they need to do, like we saw in the [new] study."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The new study also "gives us good-enough evidence that we really need to create some policies that are really specific around creating age limits, for example, on social media apps," says Madigan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Denmark announced last week that it plans to enforce a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/tech/denmark-children-social-media-ban-scli-intl" target="_blank"&gt;social media ban for users under age 15&lt;/a&gt;, she notes. Australia is requiring social media companies to "take reasonable steps to prevent Australians under the age of 16 from creating or keeping an account" starting December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Madigan hopes other countries will take note.

This tick is especially devastating to cattle and it is important for farmers to be on the lookout,” said Raghu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Young, an entomologist with an Iowa-based USDA lab, wrote Raghu recently noting: “This is likely the first record of Asian longhorned tick in Butler County, Ohio pending verification by other USDA sources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a late June &lt;a class="Link" href="https://odh.ohio.gov/know-our-programs/zoonotic-disease-program/media/longhorned-tick-distribution-map"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the Ohio Department of Health (ODH), the single-digit cases of the tick had been reported in 14 southeast Ohio counties, with none being farther west of that region than Franklin County in Central Ohio and Pike and Ross counties in the state’s south-central region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no ODH reports of the tick in Butler or other southwest and west-central counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the problematic nature of the tick is a rapid reproduction rate, said Raghu, because the species’ females are asexual and can reproduce without males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The female doesn’t have to mate before she can lay thousands of tick eggs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a completely different species that isn’t found in our area. And from my talks with experts, this is not going away and will just become more prevalent,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem is that the ticks can carry really bad infectious diseases. When a tick bites and it is allowed to feed (on its host) for more than 24 hours, that is when whatever infectious disease it is harboring spreads through their saliva.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hamilton-based dog was treated and doing fine, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid all species of ticks on dogs and cats, Raghu recommends using tick prevention drugs and other applications year around – not just in the warmer months – and to keep dogs and cats from walking in long grass and taller plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every dolphin studied from Florida’s Indian River Lagoon had a brain toxin called 2,4-DAB.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Toxin levels were roughly 3,000 times higher during summer algal bloom months.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Dolphins’ brains showed the same Alzheimer’s-related proteins and gene activity seen in humans.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Scientists say these animals may be warning us about neurotoxin risks in warming coastal waters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIAMI —&lt;/strong&gt; Less than 200 miles from Miami-Dade County, the place with the highest number of Alzheimer’s patients in America, dolphins are washing up dead with brains full of toxins and riddled with the same disease signatures. Scientists say these marine mammals may be sounding an alarm about coastal waters that millions of people depend on for food and recreation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Florida’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dolphins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bottlenose dolphins&lt;/a&gt; have long been considered sentinels for environmental dangers that could affect people. As long-lived mammals at the top of the food chain, they accumulate toxins the same way humans do when eating seafood. Now, research published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08796-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reveals that 20 dolphins stranded along Florida’s Indian River Lagoon between 2010 and 2019 all tested positive for a brain toxin called 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB). Their brains showed the genetic and physical hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proximity raises questions. Miami-Dade County recorded the highest prevalence of people living with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; in the United States in 2024. Whether there’s any connection between human cases and what’s happening to dolphins in nearby waters remains unknown, but the parallels are unsettling enough that researchers are calling for investigation into how harmful &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/toxic-algae-blooms-clilmate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;algal bloom&lt;/a&gt; toxins might be impacting human brain health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dolphins are particularly valuable for understanding Alzheimer’s risk because they naturally develop the disease’s two main brain changes as they age: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/amyloid-beta/"&gt;amyloid-beta plaques&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/game-changing-blood-test-alzheimers-tau-tangles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tau tangles&lt;/a&gt;. When researchers examined dolphin brain tissue under a microscope, they found these same abnormalities. Amyloid-beta deposits scattered through the cortex. Neurons filled with abnormal tau protein. TDP-43 inclusions inside cells and around blood vessels. The physical evidence matched what pathologists see in human Alzheimer’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Summer Blooms Bring Thousandfold Toxin Spike&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, the University of Miami, and Brain Chemistry Labs examined dolphins that stranded along a 155-kilometer stretch of Florida’s east coast. When they measured brain concentrations of 2,4-DAB, the pattern was stark: during summer bloom months (June through November, when water is warmest), toxin levels were roughly three thousand times higher than during winter months when blooms are minimal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This neurotoxin comes from microscopic organisms that create harmful algal blooms, those thick mats of cyanobacteria that have plagued the Indian River Lagoon for 15 years. As &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; heats coastal waters, these blooms start earlier and last longer. Florida has recorded some of its warmest surface temperatures in modern history over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toxins move up the food chain, concentrating in small fish that larger predators eat. A dolphin consuming many fish per day accumulates substantial amounts over time, and the toxins end up in brain tissue. Similar processes happen when people regularly &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/seafood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;eat seafood&lt;/a&gt; from bloom-affected waters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetic Changes Mirror Human Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When scientists analyzed the complete set of active genes in these dolphin brains, they identified 536 genes with significantly different expression levels between bloom and non-bloom seasons. Many were the same genes disrupted in human &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dolphins showed decreased activity in genes that produce glutamate decarboxylase, an enzyme responsible for making GABA (a neurotransmitter that helps calm brain activity). Meanwhile, 2,4-DAB appears to block the enzyme that breaks GABA down, creating a chemical imbalance. In human &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/pee-alzheimers-memory-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s patients&lt;/a&gt;, this same enzyme shows reduced function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found increased activity in genes related to laminin-3, a protein that helps maintain the blood-brain barrier. Elevated levels could signal that this protective shield (which keeps toxins out of neural tissue) is compromised. In human Alzheimer’s patients, the same protein shows up in disease-related plaques.&lt;/p&gt;

(Credit: David Davis)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three genes particularly stood out. APP produces amyloid precursor protein, which breaks down into toxic peptides that form plaques. MAPT makes tau protein, which tangles in the neurons of dementia patients. TARDBP creates TDP-43, a protein that clumps abnormally in more than half of Alzheimer’s cases with rapid progression. All three showed increased expression in dolphins exposed to higher toxin levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most concerning was the temporal pattern. Researchers identified 15 genes whose expression correlated with both the amount of toxin in the brain and the year the dolphin stranded. Effects appeared to intensify with each subsequent &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/toxin-in-the-air-algae-blooms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bloom season&lt;/a&gt;, as if brains were accumulating damage over time. Among these genes were AGER (which encodes a receptor involved in Alzheimer’s disease) and ARHGEF19 (linked to neurological disorders).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dolphins also showed increased expression of the APOE gene, up to 6.5-fold in some animals. In humans, certain versions of APOE are the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why This Neurotoxin Matters&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Originally described decades ago, 2,4-DAB provokes tremors, convulsions, and hyperirritability within hours in animal studies. It’s a structural cousin of BMAA (beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine), another algal toxin detected in the brains of human Alzheimer’s patients. Scientists believe 2,4-DAB may be even more toxic than BMAA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers compared dolphin gene expression data with databases of genes affected by &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/vitamin-sea-scientists-create-way-to-supercharge-shellfish-with-nutrients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shellfish&lt;/a&gt; poisoning (caused by other algal toxins), they found that 98% of the dolphin genes overlapped with Alzheimer’s disease, while only 42% overlapped with both conditions. None overlapped exclusively with shellfish poisoning, which means the changes observed were more closely related to neurodegeneration than to acute toxic illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harmful algal blooms are not unique to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. As the planet warms, they’re increasing worldwide in both frequency and intensity. Coastal communities from &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/california/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/forever-chemicals-great-lakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; to the Gulf Coast are dealing with blooms that once were rare or nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People who live near affected waters, who fish recreationally or commercially, or who eat seafood from bloom-affected areas could face exposures similar to what dolphins experience. Toxins accumulate in fish tissue. They can become aerosolized in sea spray. They persist in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Questions naturally follow. Could repeated exposure to algal neurotoxins over years or decades increase Alzheimer’s risk in people? Are certain populations at higher risk based on where they live and what they eat? Should public health officials be monitoring neurotoxin levels in seafood more closely?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Miami-Dade County’s high Alzheimer’s prevalence could reflect many factors: an aging population, genetic backgrounds, healthcare access, environmental exposures. But the county sits on the coast, near waters experiencing repeated harmful algal blooms and hosting dolphins with toxin-damaged brains showing &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s signatures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sentinel species exist for a reason. Canaries in coal mines died from carbon monoxide before miners felt the effects, providing a warning. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dolphins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; accumulating brain toxins and developing Alzheimer’s signatures in waters near major population centers may be offering a similar alert. As bloom seasons lengthen and intensify with climate change, these marine mammals are delivering a message from the warming water that coastal communities and public health officials need to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined 20 common bottlenose dolphins that stranded along Florida’s Indian River Lagoon between 2010 and 2019, classifying them by stranding date into non-bloom season (December–May, 11 dolphins) and bloom season (June–November, 9 dolphins). From each dolphin, they extracted brain tissue and tested it for neurotoxins using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, performed whole transcriptome sequencing to analyze gene expression differences, used quantitative PCR to measure seven Alzheimer’s-related genes, and prepared tissue slides to visualize Alzheimer’s-like protein changes under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every dolphin tested positive for 2,4-DAB, with bloom-season dolphins showing median brain concentrations approximately 2,900 times higher than non-bloom dolphins. Transcriptome analysis identified 536 differentially expressed genes, with decreased glutamate decarboxylase activity (GABA production) and increased laminin-3 complex expression (blood-brain barrier components). Three key Alzheimer’s genes—APP, MAPT, and TARDBP—showed increased expression correlating with toxin levels, and microscopic examination revealed Alzheimer’s-like changes in all dolphins including amyloid-beta deposits, phosphorylated tau, and TDP-43 inclusions. Fifteen genes showed expression patterns correlating with both toxin concentration and stranding year, intensifying with each bloom season, while APOE gene expression increased up to 6.5-fold in some bloom-season dolphins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The small sample size of 20 dolphins collected opportunistically over nine years limited statistical power, and researchers could not control for all variables affecting brain health or assess neurological function in living animals. The study could not establish direct cause-and-effect relationships between toxin exposure and brain changes, only correlations, and not all samples included tissue from both brain regions. While dolphins serve as sentinel species for environmental health, differences between dolphin and human biology mean findings cannot be directly extrapolated to human health risks without additional research.&lt;/p&gt;

A sharp brain also keeps chronic conditions such as dementia at bay. But how exactly do you achieve this? Lifestyle factors play a vital role in brain health. One of the best modifiable factors is exercise. Yes, regular exercise is linked to improved brain health and reduced risk of dementia. Increasing evidence shows that physical activity and exercise training may delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. Here are some science-backed exercises that are linked to a healthier brain and reduced risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aerobic exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aerobic exercise tops the list for dementia prevention. This form of exercise elevates the heart rate and floods the brain with oxygen and BDNF, a protein that nurtures new neurons. A 2021 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2021.660181/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by the researchers at the Florida Atlantic University found that aerobic exercise improves cognitive function in older adults. The researchers investigated how aerobic exercise affects certain biomarkers and brain-related metabolic pathways in older adults at risk for Alzheimer’s disease. They focused on three biomarkers linked to learning and memory: Cathepsin B (CTSB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and klotho, along with metabolomic changes in the blood. They found that CTSB levels increased after 26 weeks of aerobic exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This showed positive improvements in verbal learning and memory. The BDNF plasma levels decreased slightly but were linked with beneficial metabolomic changes, which may have neuroprotective effects. The researchers concluded that aerobic exercise can positively impact cognition and brain health in adults at risk for AD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weight training&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's right. Yes, that's right. Weight training is not just beneficial to save your muscles but also protects your brain. A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-024-01483-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; carried out at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), found that weight training protects the brain from dementia. The study had 44 participants with mild cognitive impairment, an intermediate clinical condition between normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease in which cognitive decline is greater than expected for age, indicating a higher risk of dementia. They found that strength training not only improved memory performance but also altered brain anatomy. Stressing the need for exercise, over expensive medications, the researchers said, “For example, the new anti-amyloid drugs approved in the United States, indicated for the treatment of dementia and for people with mild cognitive impairment, cost around USD 30,000 a year. That’s a very high cost. These non-pharmacological measures, as we’ve shown is the case with weight training, are effective, not only in preventing dementia but also in improving mild cognitive impairment.” They also added that any form of exercise is good for the brain. “Any physical exercise, whether weight training or aerobic activity, is known to increase levels of a chemical involved in brain cell growth. It can also mobilize anti-inflammatory T-cells. This is key," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 creative activities to boost brain power, sharpen memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Simple exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You really don't have to complicate your exercise regimen to achieve brain benefits. In fact, even simple and light exercise may help. A recent landmark clinical &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.14586" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; of physical exercise in older adults with mild memory loss found that even light exercise could help slow cognitive decline in people who are at risk of Alzheimer’s disease. “These findings show us that even low-intensity exercise may slow cognitive decline in at-risk older adults,” the researchers said. "Any lower-to moderate-intensity activities, such as walking, stretching, yoga, Tai Chi, or light jogging, can be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwJBVV95cUxQZnBYTzZyZS1HdFB4bUdEZjdKclUxMU1ZVlpCRF8tR3g4cUpUUldXcG9zXzV2VFp4Y0pQOUMtY3FjdWtVS1d2QnkwUUlwZHlBUTRta245LWlYRS1YRm02TktFUXpyMUtyZ3RuVmpzZ21xdkRIcEs3bFhYQXM2WFN4NGx0Um81WmNldk9ER0lReXd0a25pTzlJNE1NWnBOclQ5ci1NWFlHUEtoSjRjUjBfZ3A1Y1ltQTVDZnUzbGU3c2ZqbzByQ0RaR3lSQzg2R1RMTW0yM21oNnBZUVl4OGRNYWRCTlVTbFU5Ymhidjlkakg1ZWg0WXh5WC1rdVcyRzd0c0hiX2VUN0lrN3c</guid></item><item><title>剖腹产与母亲较高的疼痛和睡眠问题风险有关-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15187149/C-section-high-risk-pain-sleep-disorders-mothers.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mothers who give birth by C-section are more likely to experience excruciating pain that affects their day-to-day life and develop debilitating sleep disorders, concerning new research has suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Presenting their findings at the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.asahq.org/annualmeeting"&gt;Anesthesiology 2025 annual meeting&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers are urging doctors to make women aware of the risks, and refer expectant mothers to sleep specialists if sleep issues persist once they've given birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sleep is often overlooked in postpartum recovery, but it's central to a mothers' physical and mental health,' Dr Moe Takenoshita, an expert in anesthesia at Stanford University Center for Academic Medicine and study lead author said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cesarean delivery in particular appears to increase the risk for severe pain and sleep disorders, which can lead to postpartum &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-761c0e70-a822-11f0-972d-c9be04751783"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, thinking and memory problems and fatigue, as well as disrupt bonding with their babies.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the researchers asked over 40 mothers about their pain and sleep after childbirth—21 of which had vaginal births, 11 who has scheduled c-sections and six whose c-sections were unplanned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than two-thirds of the mothers who had c-sections reported severe pain that affected their sleep and day-to-day lives, compared to just 8 per cent who gave birth naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at insurance data from more than 1.5million mothers who had their babies between 2008 and 2021, the researchers also found that those who had C-sections were 16 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with a new sleep disorder—such as insomnia, sleep deprivations or sleep apnea—within a year of giving birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This highlights the need for new mothers, especially those recovering from C-sections, to be properly informed about pain management and given effective treatment plans to help manage symptoms and improve sleep, Dr Takenoshita said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-module-version="1.16.1" data-dataset-id="2057" data-mol-fe-xpmodule-newsletter-sign-up data-newsletter="configurable" data-form-action-url="https://link.news.dailymail.co.uk/s/Health" data-environment="production" data-newsletter-id="Health" data-newsletter-channel-colour="health" data-watermark="uk" data-image="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2025/10/10/health_newsletter.png" data-title="Sign up for our free Health newsletter" data-subtitle="Transform your health every Tuesday with expert guides, real-life stories and advice from top doctors"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;New mothers who give birth via c-section are more likely to suffer severe pain and develop sleep disorders than those who have a vaginal birth &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that new mothers can also try implementing exercise, sleeping when their baby sleeps, avoiding caffeine and alcohol late in the day and practicing deep breathing exercises to help boost sleep at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around one third of births in the US are C-sections, whilst around one in four women in the UK has a caesarean birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But rates of the procedure are rising globally, with figures particularly stark in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2025, 42 per cent of women gave birth via C-section—with experts putting the upward trend down to obesity rates, more women having their babies later than previous generations, and obstetric norms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts are concerned that women are not being made aware of the risks that come with the procedure—which women can chose to have for non-medical reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Takenoshita cautioned: 'Those who are planning a C-section should understand that the procedure is linked to more severe pain after delivery and a higher risk of sleep disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Anyone having sleep problems during pregnancy or after childbirth should discuss their concerns with their physician, who can evaluate the issue, make recommendations and refer them to a specialist if necessary,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor sleep has long been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer stroke and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Poor sleep has long been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer stroke and infertility, with new mothers typically getting less sleep regardless of delivery method &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly a quarter of women require emergency Caesareans, according to NHS Digital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even sleep deprivation in the short-term has been shown to take its toll—from irritability and reduced focus, to increased risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A C-section is considered a major operation, which involves making a cut across a woman's stomach and womb, that carries a number of risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such, the procedure is usually only carried out if it's considered the safest option for both the mother and child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It may be recommended as a planned procedure—where the risks have been identified and considered before 39 weeks—or carried out in an emergency if vaginal birth is deemed too risky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may recommend this if the baby is in the breech position, the mother has a low-lying placenta or pregnancy-related high blood pressure, or the baby is not getting enough oxygen and nutrients meaning they need to be delivered immediately.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, women can also opt for a c-section for non medical reasons. If after discussing all the risks with a medical professional, if a woman feels that vaginal birth is still not a viable option for them, they should be offered a planned caesarean, the NHS website states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recovery also usually takes longer than recovering from a vaginal delivery and possible complications can arise including infection, blood clots, excessive bleeding, damage to surrounding tissue and organs, and temporary breathing difficulties for the baby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The study found that both green spaces like parks and forests and blue spaces such as rivers and lakes were associated with higher levels of happiness. This pattern held true for people with and without common mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health challenges, ranging from temporary distress to persistent conditions like depression and anxiety, affect millions worldwide. Treatment options, including therapy and medication, can be costly, difficult to access, or culturally stigmatized. Given these barriers, researchers have been exploring how spending time in nature might serve as a helpful and widely accessible supplement to conventional care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that natural settings can support emotional well-being, especially by enhancing positive moods. These benefits have been observed across different countries and populations, but questions remain. How long do the emotional effects of a nature visit last? Do they influence the overall mood of the entire day, or are the benefits short-lived? Are people with mental health conditions affected differently than others? And do green and blue environments offer similar psychological effects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study, led by Tobias Harvey and &lt;a href="https://cognitivescience.univie.ac.at/about/pis-scientific-project-staff/mat-white/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mathew P. White&lt;/a&gt;, was designed to address these gaps by analyzing how nature visits relate to daily well-being across a broad sample of adults, including those with self-reported depression and anxiety. By focusing on how people felt “yesterday,” the researchers aimed to capture the emotional ripple effects of spending time in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is plenty of research showing that people (often) feel happier and less anxious in safe natural settings compared to urban and indoor settings. However, there is little evidence concerning whether these momentary feelings have any positive spill-over afterwards or whether when we return to our busy urban lives we immediately go back to the more stressed and tense emotions often associated with these,” explained White, an assistant professor at the University of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was based on survey data collected from 2,140 Austrian adults in October 2020. The sample was balanced to represent the national population in terms of age, gender, and region. Participants were asked about their emotional state the previous day, specifically how happy and how anxious they felt, using standard questions developed by international organizations. They also reported whether they had visited any of 29 different types of green or blue spaces during their leisure time on that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green spaces included places such as public parks, woodlands, and meadows. Blue spaces referred to water-based environments like rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Each participant was asked whether they had visited any such location. Researchers also collected information on whether respondents were currently taking doctor-prescribed medication for depression or anxiety, which was used to identify those with common mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the impact of these visits, the researchers controlled for a wide range of variables that might also affect daily well-being. These included age, sex, employment status, income satisfaction, marital status, disability, and whether the day in question was a weekday or weekend. Measures of general life satisfaction and sense of purpose were also included to isolate the specific effects of nature visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two-thirds of participants reported visiting green spaces the previous day, while around one-third had visited blue spaces. Roughly 14 percent said they were taking medication for anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the data, the researchers found that people who visited green or blue spaces tended to report higher levels of happiness for the entire day. This pattern held true even after accounting for other factors known to influence well-being. Whether or not participants had a mental health condition did not alter the positive link between nature visits and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Supporting a positive-spill-over effect, when people reflected on their day ‘yesterday’ they reported being generally happier and less anxious on days when they had visited green or blue spaces than when they had not,” White told PsyPost. “Importantly, the happiness and anxious questions were asked &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they were asked to report whether they had visited nature to reduce possible biases from being asked to think about yesterday’s activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of course, we also controlled for other factors which might have made yesterday both more positive overall and increased the chances of spending time in nature (e.g. day of the week) and still found the effect. Importantly the associations were generally present for both the general population and those with anxiety and depression, shining a light on activities that people struggling with their mental health might engage in to help them manage their condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the results for anxiety were less clear-cut. In general, visiting nature was not associated with lower anxiety. But a more specific pattern emerged when the researchers looked at people with mental health conditions. Those who visited blue spaces tended to report higher anxiety compared to those who did not visit nature, or who visited green spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding may seem counterintuitive at first. However, the authors propose that it could reflect a form of emotional self-management. In other words, people experiencing anxiety may seek out blue spaces in an attempt to regulate their emotions. These environments may not eliminate anxiety entirely but may still offer temporary relief or a sense of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we had not expected that people with common mental health disorders (e.g. anxiety and depression) would feel more anxious on days including blue space visits, this was found despite them also feeling happier yesterday,” White said. “One possibility for these seemingly contradictory finding is that visiting the blue space did not increase anxiety levels but rather people visited blue spaces to help them manage their anxieties earlier in the day. Unfortunately because we only asked them to summarize their feelings across the whole day (in keeping with standard practices) we are unable to test this possibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also reaffirmed other known patterns. For instance, older adults and people who were married, financially comfortable, or reported higher life satisfaction tended to say they were happier. Those with disabilities or who reported lower satisfaction with life or income were more likely to report anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings provide support for the idea that nature visits can improve daily well-being, especially happiness, the study has some limitations. For example, the research relied on self-reported data from a single day. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about cause and effect. For example, while people may feel happier after visiting a park, it is also possible that happier people are more likely to go outside. Similarly, higher anxiety in those who visited blue spaces could mean that they were already feeling anxious and sought out water-based environments for comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could address these limitations by using more nuanced measures of mental health, collecting data across multiple days, and incorporating objective assessments such as GPS tracking or physiological indicators. Qualitative research could also help explain how individuals perceive and use different natural settings for emotional regulation, especially those living with chronic stress or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, we are working on a large 4-year multi-country European Union funded project (&lt;a href="https://resonate-horizon.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;RESONATE&lt;/a&gt;) that is testing a range of nature-based therapies for different populations and groups,” White said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2025.2549296" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Happy days are nature days: visiting nature has positive spill-over effects for the entire day among people with and without common mental health disorders&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tobias Harvey, Mathew P.

But doctors and health officials say &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-texas-preventable-symptoms/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-measles-outbreak-what-to-know/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;highly safe and effective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in South Carolina is part of a larger trend seen across the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-measles-cases-jump-to-20/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;health officials in Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reported two new measles cases this week, bringing the state's total number this year to 20. The Minnesota Department of Health said each of the new cases involves unvaccinated children who likely caught measles from an unvaccinated adult. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/measles-case-reported-minneapolis-school/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Eighteen out of the 20 measles cases are children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the health department added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And earlier this year, the United States recorded the most &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-us-cases-record-high-since-1992/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in more than 30 years, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed. A &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;large share of the infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-death-texas-outbreak/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/texas-measles-outbreak-second-child-death-unvaccinated/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;two children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreaks-schools-vaccination-rates-decline/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;down from 95.2%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during the 2019-2020 school year — a critical threshold to keep people safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity)," &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the CDC states&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest South Carolina briefing, the upstate region has only about 90% immunity, leaving the community vulnerable to the virus spreading. &lt;/p&gt;

ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251013040323.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have shown that their nanoparticle-based vaccine can successfully prevent several aggressive cancers in mice, including melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer. Depending on the cancer type, up to 88% of vaccinated mice stayed tumor-free (depending on the cancer), and the vaccine also reduced -- and in some cases completely prevented -- the spread of cancer throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By engineering these nanoparticles to activate the immune system via multi-pathway activation that combines with cancer-specific antigens, we can prevent tumor growth with remarkable survival rates," says Prabhani Atukorale, assistant professor of biomedical engineering in the Riccio College of Engineering at UMass Amherst and corresponding author on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atukorale had previously shown that her nanoparticle-based drug design could shrink or eliminate tumors in mice. The new findings reveal that this approach can also prevent cancer from forming in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, her team combined the nanoparticle system with well-studied melanoma peptides (called an antigen, similar to how a flu shot typically contains parts of the inactivated flu virus). This formulation activated immune cells known as T cells, training them to detect and destroy melanoma cells. Three weeks later, the vaccinated mice were exposed to melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty percent of the mice that received the "super adjuvant" nanoparticle vaccine remained tumor-free and survived the entire study period (250 days). In contrast, all of the mice that received traditional vaccines, non-nanoparticle formulations, or no vaccine at all developed tumors and died within 35 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine also stopped cancer from spreading to the lungs. When the mice were systemically exposed to melanoma cells to mimic metastasis, none of the nanoparticle-vaccinated mice developed lung tumors, while every other mouse did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Metastases across the board is the highest hurdle for cancer," says Atukorale. "The vast majority of tumor mortality is still due to metastases, and it almost trumps us working in difficult-to-reach cancers, such as melanoma and pancreatic cancer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atukorale refers to this protection as "memory immunity." "That is a real advantage of immunotherapy, because memory is not only sustained locally," she explains. "We have memory systemically, which is very important. The immune system spans the entire geography of the body."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase of testing used a vaccine with known antigens designed for melanoma. However, creating antigens for each cancer type can require extensive genome sequencing or bioinformatics analysis. To simplify the process, the researchers tested a second version using killed tumor cells, called tumor lysate, derived directly from the cancer itself. Mice vaccinated with this nanoparticle lysate vaccine were later exposed to melanoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or triple-negative breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were impressive: 88% of mice with pancreatic cancer, 75% with breast cancer, and 69% with melanoma rejected tumor formation. Furthermore, all mice that remained tumor-free after vaccination also resisted metastasis when exposed systemically to cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The tumor-specific T-cell responses that we are able to generate -- that is really the key behind the survival benefit," says Griffin Kane, postdoctoral research associate at UMass Amherst and first author on the paper. "There is really intense immune activation when you treat innate immune cells with this formulation, which triggers these cells to present antigens and prime tumor-killing T cells."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This robust T-cell response is possible because of the particular nanoparticle design of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines -- regardless the target disease -- contain two primary components: The antigen and the adjuvant. The antigen is the piece of the disease-causing pathogen (in this study, cancer cells) that the immune system can be trained to target. The adjuvant is a substance that activates the immune system to recognize the antigen, treat it as a foreign intruder and eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atukorale Lab draws inspiration from how pathogens naturally stimulate the immune system. To mount a strong immune response, the body requires multiple "danger" signals triggered through different pathways. "In recent years, we have come to understand how important the selection of the adjuvant is because it drives the second signal that is needed for the correct priming of T and B cells," says Atukorale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just like oil and water, many of the most promising adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy do not mix well at the molecular level. To overcome this, the Atukorale Lab has engineered a lipid nanoparticle-based "super adjuvant" capable of stably encapsulating and co-delivering two distinct immune adjuvants that activate immunity in a coordinated, synergistic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that their design offers a platform approach that could be used across multiple cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers envision that this platform can be applied to create both therapeutic and preventative regimens, particularly for individuals at high risk for cancer. This is an idea that Atukorale and Kane have turned into a startup called NanoVax Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The real core technology that our company has been founded on is this nanoparticle and this treatment approach," says Kane. "This is a platform that Prabhani developed. The startup lets us pursue these translational efforts with the ultimate goal of improving patients' lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Atukorale and Kane plan to extend this technology to a therapeutic vaccine and have already taken the initial de-risking steps in translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atukorale and Kane credit the Biomedical Engineering department and the Institute for Applied Life Sciences at UMass Amherst, UMass Chan Medical School, and funding from the National Institutes of Health for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the October 9 edition of &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Gestational diabetes occurs temporarily during pregnancy, marked by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that's thought to be driven by hormonal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2e8f26fa-f483-4f25-ae1a-d75513e9114d"&gt;Additionally, there are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-diabetes/types-of-diabetes" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-diabetes/types-of-diabetes" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;other rare forms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of diabetes that can result from specific genetic mutations or diseases. But now, scientists say there's another type of diabetes with a very different cause from the other kinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(25)00263-3/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(25)00263-3/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;formally classified as "type 5 diabetes"&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during an international meeting of experts in India earlier this year. (They chose the label "type 5" because other researchers have already proposed "type 3" and "type 4" for other forms of diabetes.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Type 5 diabetes is characterized by insufficient insulin secretion leading to elevated blood glucose levels, similar to other forms of diabetes," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/1689085839/rachel-leigh-reinert" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/1689085839/rachel-leigh-reinert" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Rachel Reinert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an endocrinologist and assistant professor at the University of Michigan, told Live Science in an email. "However, type 5 diabetes is not associated with autoimmunity (as in type 1 diabetes) nor insulin resistance (as is common in type 2 diabetes)." It also lacks the features of the more rare type 3 and type 4 diabetes, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Individuals with type 5 diabetes typically have low body weight and a history of undernutrition starting in early life," Reinert said. Doctors think that chronic undernutrition damages the pancreas early in life, leaving its insulin-producing cells permanently weakened. So the pancreas cannot make enough insulin, but if a patient is given insulin as treatment, their cells are able to respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZqrtXyRHbye7Ek9aFntv7e" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZqrtXyRHbye7Ek9aFntv7e slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment for type 5 diabetes needs to be managed carefully as too much insulin, coupled with too little food — a common reality in low-income countries — could result in dangerously low blood sugar. "It is important for all patients with diabetes to know which specific type of diabetes they have, so they can get the right treatment," Reinert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-84e61171-1d92-4ad0-8852-4a4f5f11dbc7" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-yoda-study-3"&gt;The YODA study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="0aa7b53d-1f5a-4a66-bbf9-90f889254d87"&gt;Earlier this year, the Young-Onset Diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa (YODA) study, published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(25)00120-2/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(25)00120-2/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, renewed interest in the condition. The team initially set out to investigate type 1 diabetes among nearly 900 young adults across Cameroon, Uganda and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the researchers analyzed blood samples, they found that roughly two-thirds of participants lacked the autoimmune markers seen in type 1 diabetes. Further testing revealed that these individuals still produced small but measurable amounts of insulin, unlike classic type 1 cases. But their insulin levels were below the range typically seen in type 2 diabetes. These findings pointed to a distinct, non-autoimmune, insulin-deficient type of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not the first time in history that the condition had been observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1950s, British physician Philip Hugh-Jones encountered a group of 13 patients at his diabetes clinic near Kingston, Jamaica, whose symptoms did not fit type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Hugh-Jones called their condition "type J," for Jamaica, but the label was forgotten and the condition was overlooked for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-24336483-2111-4d30-902d-65c6d72b2bfe" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-s-in-a-name-3"&gt;What's in a name?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="f7759bfc-0e72-449f-bd7b-e36a6a0ae67a"&gt;Correctly naming a disease not only helps guide clinicians to the best treatment options, it can also help researchers to track its prevalence and identify which factors affect patients' outcomes, Reinert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="bf7b7bed-9a45-456b-a33c-3d7afce238ae"&gt;Although type 5 diabetes has likely existed for decades, a lack of research has kept it poorly understood.

    &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;On Nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recurring (and vexing) problem with nutrition research is how inaccurately many studies are communicated. This is most likely to happen on social media and dubious online “media outlets,” but it can happen in reputable media outlets, too. The origins of the miscommunication often come from:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study abstracts (aka summaries) that overinflate the findings of the actual study&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;News releases from university press offices that overinflate or unreasonably extrapolate the findings to populations (based on gender, age, race or species) that weren’t actually studied&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Writers and social media posters who don’t know how to read and write about research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When all three are at play, it can end up a bit like a game of telephone, where what is said about a research study gets further from the truth with each step. One recent cringeworthy example generated headlines such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The hidden neurological war inside every fast-food meal.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Bingeing on junk food for just 4 days can damage your brain’s memory hub.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Your junk food craving might be harming your memory.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Junk food can scramble your brain in just four days.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Junk food might be quietly wrecking your memory.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last headline came from the online version of a popular lifestyle magazine. A few key details in the article are, “junk food can cause the neurons in your brain to become overactive, leading to impaired memory in just four days,” “a special group of brain cells in the hippocampus often become overly active when introduced to a high-fat diet.” And “a high-fat diet typically includes foods like cheeseburgers and fries, or those that are ultraprocessed and typically drenched in saturated fat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on that brief excerpt, ask yourself: What kind of study was this (human or animal)? What were the subjects eating? What were the researchers measuring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered “humans,” “junk food” and something like “a before-and-after test that assessed how ‘scrambled’ their memories were,” those are quite reasonable answers. But there’s one huge problem — the researchers didn’t study humans, or junk food, or scrambled memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was on mice. Not only are humans not mice, but four days is more significant in the short life of a mouse than it is in a long human life. Rather than the cheeseburgers and fries or the doughnuts and chips and pizza shown in the photos that accompany these articles, the mice got a diet of high-fat mouse pellet food. Finally, this study looked at mouse neurons — not human brain function. And while the neurons in the memory center of the brain did become overactive, there was no mention of “scrambled” brains or memories anywhere in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The articles written about this study look like examples of “creative” journalism, but the problem began with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031249.htm" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;the news release&lt;/a&gt; about the study, which led with the headline, “Junk food can scramble memory in just four days,” then doubled down by boldly making the unreasonable extrapolation from mouse to human and high-fat mouse chow to burgers and fries. While most of the reporting I saw on this study was just a minor rewrite of the news release, the excerpt I shared was from the worst of the articles — it failed to even mention that the study was done on mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was nothing at all wrong with &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(25)00622-1?" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;the actual study&lt;/a&gt; (from what I could tell). What was wrong was the spin, and as someone who supports nutrition science, that makes me sad, especially when that spin contributes to the Wild West of nutrition misinformation out there.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

to tackle high cholesterol — and telmisartan, often used in the UK to slash high blood pressure, could 'significantly' reduce fat build up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, who carried out the tests on rats and zebrafish, also found the combination could lower heart and blood vessel complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts today labelled the findings 'important' and said using the drug duo could prove a potentially safer and more effective option than current limited treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Marta Alegret, an expert in pharmacy and food sciences at the University of Barcelona and study co-author said the combination was beneficial not only for liver disease, but also because 'it lowers blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and all this would result in a lower cardiovascular risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Mortality from cardiovascular causes is significant in patients with MASLD, and often these patients also have these two risk factors together.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-module-version="1.16.1" data-dataset-id="2057" data-mol-fe-xpmodule-newsletter-sign-up data-newsletter="configurable" data-form-action-url="https://link.news.dailymail.co.uk/s/Health" data-environment="production" data-newsletter-id="Health" data-newsletter-channel-colour="health" data-watermark="uk" data-image="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2025/10/10/health_newsletter.png" data-title="Sign up for our free Health newsletter" data-subtitle="Transform your health every Tuesday with expert guides, real-life stories and advice from top doctors"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Spanish scientists have discovered that combining pemafibrate — a drug to tackle high cholesterol — and telmisartan, often used to slash high blood pressure, could 'significantly' reduce fat build up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the scientists evaluated the potential of pemafibrate and telmisartan on MASLD when taken both together and separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found when taken in combination, the two drugs reversed fat accumulation in the liver triggered by a diet high in fat and fructose — a sugar found naturally in fruits, vegetables, and honey and added to products including fizzy drinks, sweets and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During tests on rats, they also discovered a combination of half a dose of pemafibrate and half a dose of telmisartan was as effective as a full dose of either drug in reducing fat accumulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661825002853?via%3Dihub#sec0145"&gt;Pharmacological Research&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers said: 'Telmisartan is a drug that has been used in other models of MASLD, but mostly in more advanced stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Its beneficial effects have been attributed mainly to anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But in the early stages of the disease there is no inflammation or fibrosis yet, only lipid [fat] accumulation.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the scientists found that telmisartan actually restored the levels of PCK1 protein in the liver, which was lacking in the animals with MASLD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers acknowledged that the findings could not prove the two drugs reversed MASLD given the research was carried out on animals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Known medically as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the condition is not linked to heavy drinking—the more commonly known cause of liver problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'In order to be translated into a treatment for MASLD patients, clinical studies would be needed to show that the benefits observed in animal models also occur in humans,' Professor Alegret said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Where liver disease was once largely confined to the elderly and heavy drinkers, it is now rising rapidly among younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases in children have doubled over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The British Liver Trust estimates the condition may now affect one in five people in the UK—though experts have warned the true figure could be as high as 40 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worryingly, around 80 per cent of those affected remain undiagnosed, as the disease often has no obvious symptoms—or it has symptoms that are mistaken for less serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, it is only spotted during routine blood tests or liver function tests carried out for unrelated issues.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with MASLD have excess fat in their liver and one or more metabolic risk factors, which can include obesity, high blood sugar and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly one in four patients has a more advanced form called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this condition, fat buildup has led to inflammation, cell damage and, in some cases, liver scarring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Up to 1 in 5 people with MASH will progress to cirrhosis — advanced, irreversible scarring of the liver — which can lead to liver failure and increase the risk of liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When liver function starts to decline, though, patients can accumulate fluid in the abdomen, develop jaundice or experience confusion caused by a buildup of toxins in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 12:36:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOVk1JY3ZXVF9yWGs5TXJOVUF5TV9GR3FlT2lpbXdoRGJwTE92UEFLckRjYjl4MVl0blFvYlVzQ3dtYXdlY1ZiRXo5bkFPN19VLVhlSnNtbEM0UDFlR1dmUzJ4N0VOUzI3WFBNbGthY0k1dXVpYkV6dmk1TlZMRTRsRkw3a1NiNGFod21LUUY5NnptaWE5RWxoQVRfQVpnTzJ0bFJ4d0F6dlR3SVVZZEZYZVFIaXlJQdIBuwFBVV95cUxQaFU5VmVQeG1rc05sMDdSRXJ1Q0ZndGdXLWRjM3o3OTE3dHBJSmFnellPMkJoSFFQQVlaZG5hRzBzbEhvUERrSl9HYXd6aEQwSDhNVk9aUlRlWFpCUTU5cnh5Q1cyVXFndzBhdERYUmY4cGFpaTRQb0p1Y1BkUVlYSkNiVk5Kd3ViaW1xRWFhYlktOHVKbHhEeXRxY2J6QUZrSmVubkJLdE9iN2h3NGJidkgtbzZuUUVQM0dv</guid></item><item><title>6种椅子动作，比50岁后的仰卧起坐更快地收缩顽固的腹部脂肪-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/chair-moves-shrink-belly-fat-after-50/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For many adults over 50, belly fat becomes the most stubborn part of the body to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-exercises-shrink-belly-pooch-faster-than-gym-workouts-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;slim down&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-discover-belly-fat-trigger-in-aging-bodies/" target="_blank"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obr.13895" target="_blank"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7310131/" target="_blank"&gt;hormonal shifts&lt;/a&gt; can all cause extra fat to accumulate around the abdomen. But the good news is that you can &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/6-standing-core-exercises-shrink-waist-after-50-no-floor/" target="_blank"&gt;shed unwanted fat around your midsection&lt;/a&gt; without endless crunches or intense workouts. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8497689/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that low-impact strength and mobility exercises can be just as effective at reducing abdominal fat when paired with consistency and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7317364/" target="_blank"&gt;healthy lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After 50, belly fat can be one of the hardest areas to slim down,” says &lt;b&gt;Kris Herbert, CPT&lt;/b&gt;, a certified personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kris-herbert-803829194/" target="_blank"&gt;The Gym Venice&lt;/a&gt;. “And while crunches are often the go-to, they’re not the most effective—or the safest—option. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/6-chair-moves-shrink-belly-pooch-in-30-days-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;Chair-based exercises&lt;/a&gt; offer a joint-friendly, functional alternative that elevates your heart rate, strengthens your core, and burns calories to help reduce stubborn belly fat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knee lifts are one of the best chair exercises for engaging your lower abs and hip flexors while keeping your back supported. The controlled motion builds stability through your trunk and hips, which can help support posture and improve core strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit tall on the edge of a sturdy chair, gripping the sides for support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core and lift both knees toward your chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower them back down slowly without letting your feet touch the floor, if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beginner tip: &lt;/b&gt;If lifting both legs is too challenging, raise one leg at a time until you get stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid this mistake:&lt;/b&gt; Don’t lean back or hunch forward. Stay upright with your chest up and back straight to protect your spine and fully engage your abs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movement targets the obliques (side abs) and can help improve spinal mobility and rotational strength. Plus, twisting movements target your deep ab muscles that contribute to a smaller waistline and better stability during everyday activities like reaching or turning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit upright with your feet flat on the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your arms straight in front of you, palms together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twist your torso slowly to the right, return to center, then twist to the left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps per side. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beginner tip: &lt;/b&gt;Keep your movements small and controlled. You can rest your hands across your chest if extending your arms feels too intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid this mistake:&lt;/b&gt; Don’t swing your arms or twist too fast, which can strain your lower back. Focus on moving from your waist, not your shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gentle movement keeps your heart rate up while targeting the lower belly area that often resists fat loss. “Chair marches provide low-impact cardio to burn fat, improve endurance, and elevate metabolism,” says Herbert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit tall on the edge of a chair with your core engaged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift one knee toward your chest, lower it, and repeat on the other side as if marching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pump your arms for added intensity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 30 to 60 seconds. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beginner tip: &lt;/b&gt;Start with shorter time intervals (15 to 20 seconds) and build up as your stamina improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid this mistake:&lt;/b&gt; Don’t let your shoulders round forward. Sit tall and pull your belly button toward your spine for better core activation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Seated side bends target the obliques and waistline while improving core flexibility and posture,” Herbert explains. This exercise also lengthens and strengthens the muscles that cinch your midsection, which can make your waist appear slimmer.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit tall with your feet flat on the floor and hands clasped behind your head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lean your torso slowly to one side, stretching your obliques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to center, then repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps per side. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beginner tip: &lt;/b&gt;Keep your range of motion small at first and focus on maintaining good form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deceptively simple exercise works your lower abs, thighs, and stabilizing muscles all at once. That’s because it engages your deep abdominal muscles that often lie hidden beneath a surface fat layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit upright with your hands gripping the sides of the chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend one leg straight out in front of you while tightening your core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the contraction for one or two seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower with control, then switch sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps per side. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beginner tip: &lt;/b&gt;Place your foot back down fully between reps if holding it up feels too intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid this mistake:&lt;/b&gt; Don’t lean backward or lock your knees. Keep your spine straight and your core tight throughout the movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sit-to-stands burn calories while strengthening legs, glutes, and core,” says Herbert. “It’s a powerful fat-burning move that mimics daily life activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit tall at the edge of your chair with feet flat and hands across your chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push through your heels to stand up without using your hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly lower back down to the chair and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beginner tip:&lt;/b&gt; Use the edge of the sturdy surface (e.g., chair or a countertop) for support until you can stand unassisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid this mistake: &lt;/b&gt;Don’t let your knees cave inward. Keep them in line with your toes and your chest upright.&lt;/p&gt;

Then again, people are weird about money. Clearly, paying you fills some psychological need for her. You’ve already made your feelings clear and tried talking her out of it, so there’s no point going down that route again. Instead, why don’t you save up the money she gives you, and every few months donate it to a children’s charity? That seems like a win-win for everyone, especially the charity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It’s up to you whether to make the donation in her name or yours. If you do it in her name, she might appreciate your thoughtful attempt to honor your feelings and hers (and the tax deduction as well) or she might see it as a passive-aggressive maneuver. You know her and I don’t, so that’s your call to make.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I work as a pediatric nurse with very sick children. When I tell people my occupation, they usually respond with “I don’t know how you deal with sick kids all day” or “How do you not go home and cry after work?” This makes me feel guilty that I can make it through a day without crying. I would hate sitting behind a desk all day. How do I get across to them without seeming insensitive that I love my job and that, although it can be depressing, I can’t imagine doing anything else? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;K.C.&lt;/b&gt; / Boston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;You think &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;feel guilty? Your job probably makes others feel guilty that they’re not contributing to the good of humanity in as direct a way as you are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I’m a pediatric nurse in a critical-care unit. What do you do?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I’m, uh, the assistant regional manager of a paper-supply company.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yeah, that guy’s feeling good about himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Joking aside, I don’t think people are saying these things to make you question yourself or out of insecurity and meanness. Rather, they truly don’t get it. It is very hard for folks outside the professions to understand the particular mix of empathy and detachment that enables people to do extraordinarily difficult jobs such as nursing or social work. Not everyone’s mind or heart is set up that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Instead of trying to explain yourself, tell some stories about the kids you’ve worked with. People understand stories better than theories. Craft one or two anecdotes about people and situations you’ve encountered in your work, and when someone asks, “How can you do that?” say, “I’ve never been an office-y kind of person, and I get so much from it. There was this one time when . . .” Then the other person will have something to grab on to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;My mother is a volunteer with hospice, and I don’t understand, myself, how being with people who are going to die can fail to be depressing and awkward. I don’t understand how her mind works that she can do that. But she’ll tell me stories — sometimes surprisingly funny ones—about her clients, and I get it in a way that I don’t have to “understand.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Inside these cells, tau proteins, which help hold brain cells together and transport nutrients, twist into threads that strangle and kill the cells. Together, these changes cause the brain to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current drugs only slow decline and carry the risk of troubling side-effects such as nausea, dizziness and sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New medications such as lecanemab, a form of immunotherapy, have recently made the headlines after they'd been shown to remove some of the amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can slow decline a little, yet these drugs can have potentially serious side-effects such as brain swelling and bleeding. They also cost tens of thousands of pounds a year, and must be given in hospital every few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Leah Mursaleen, head of clinical research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the findings were 'an exciting discovery'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No therapy yet stops or reverses the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, researchers from Harvard Medical School compared donated brain tissue from people who had died with Alzheimer's with that from healthy volunteers: they discovered that lithium was strikingly depleted in the parts of the brain hit hardest by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lithium is a naturally occurring mineral that's found in tiny amounts in the brain, where it helps nerve cells communicate and protects them from damage. The scientists believe the drop in lithium is the result of amyloid plaques draining the mineral from the cells surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further experiments in mice showed the same pattern: when lithium levels dropped, the animals developed more amyloid and tau tangles. As this happened, memory also worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the researchers gave the mice with Alzheimer's lithium orotate, a form of lithium that can reach the brain easily and doesn't become trapped by amyloid plaques, it restored the lithium levels in their brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also reduced the build-up of sticky protein plaques and tau tangles, and reversed their memory problems. (The lithium was adminstered in drinking water.) Professor Bruce Yankner, a neuroscientist who led the study, said: 'This is groundbreaking. For the first time, we can see how lithium deficiency may drive the disease – and that correcting it might undo the damage.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team says the next step is to see if the same results can be achieved in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early safety trials of lithium supplements could begin within two to three years, involving small groups with mild memory loss. If it proves safe, larger studies will test whether it can slow, or even prevent, Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because lithium – perhaps best known as a treatment for bipolar disorder – is a natural substance, it can't be patented in its basic form, so drug companies have little incentive to fund costly trials. Researchers say progress will rely on public or charity funding, unless a company develops its own new version – for example, a branded tablet or slow-release formula it can licence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For treating bipolar disorder, doctors prescribe lithium carbonate – a cheap but tightly monitored drug that can cause side-effects if the dose is too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amounts being studied for Alzheimer's are far smaller and thought to be safer, but human trials will need to confirm that. (While small amounts of lithium are also found in drinking water and foods such as grains and vegetables, the levels in these are far too low to have a medical effect.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the new study, Dr Leah Mursaleen, head of clinical research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the findings were 'exciting'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are different types of lithium salts already used to treat conditions such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia,' she told Good Health. 'Future research will need to explore which might be best suited for testing in dementia clinical trials. We're still a long way from knowing whether this could work in people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Richard Oakley, associate director of research and innovation at Alzheimer's Society, said: 'We don't yet fully understand the way lithium works and more research is needed, at a much larger scale, before it can be considered a safe and effective treatment.' He added: 'Individuals should not self-prescribe lithium as this can be dangerous.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These are the key tips we learned while developing and testing this recipe in our Test Kitchen to make sure it works, tastes great and is good for you too!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;To create a thick and rich smoothie, use frozen fruit instead of ice. Ice melts quickly and can dilute the flavors. For an even creamier consistency, consider using frozen coconut milk cubes or adding frozen bananas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the best results, add your ingredients to the blender in the order specified in the recipe, starting with the liquids. Don’t forget to scrape down the sides of the blender to ensure everything blends evenly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re looking for a different flavor profile, you can substitute the orange juice with coconut milk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To make the smoothie dairy-free, simply replace the whole-milk strained (Greek-style) yogurt with a nondairy yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Look for a brand that contains probiotics to add healthy bacteria to the gut for a more diverse microbiome. Yogurt also contains calcium for healthy bones and muscle contraction. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll get immune-boosting vitamin C from &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7928514/is-orange-juice-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;orange juice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-oranges-11680294" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;orange segments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in this smoothie. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant that can help lower inflammation and can help boost collagen production for healthy skin and joints. &lt;/li&gt;

It is approved for moderate-to-severe pain, including postoperative and chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prescriptions have risen sharply worldwide, fueled by perceptions of safety and a belief that tramadol carries a lower risk for dependence. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11603979/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;recent global analysis&lt;/a&gt; estimated that nearly 18% of adults have used tramadol in their lifetime, and more than 80% of those users combined it with at least one other substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its widespread use, evidence supporting tramadol’s long-term effectiveness and safety in chronic pain has been limited and inconsistent. Previous research has largely focused on short-term or condition-specific outcomes, such as &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/330487-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt; or neuropathic pain, leaving uncertainty about the drug’s overall risk-benefit profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Benefit, Big Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study is the first comprehensive systematic review to evaluate tramadol alone for chronic pain using both meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis, providing a broader view of efficacy and safety across pain types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We sought to fill this gap by evaluating the totality of evidence to guide clinical practice,” Barakji said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis included 19 randomized, placebo-controlled trials with 6569 adults. The average participant age was 56 years, and study durations ranged from 4 to 16 weeks. Pain intensity was typically assessed with the 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS), while function and quality of life were measured with validated patient-reported tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the pooled analysis, participants receiving tramadol experienced an average pain reduction of 0.9 points on the NRS compared with placebo — a difference below the one-point threshold considered clinically meaningful. About 7% more patients in the tramadol groups achieved noticeable pain relief, but investigators said the benefit was modest and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious adverse events were twice as common among tramadol users, most often involving cardiac complications such as chest pain, &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/349040-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;coronary artery disease&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/163062-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;. Nonserious side effects, including nausea, dizziness, &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/184704-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;, and drowsiness, were frequent and contributed to higher discontinuation rates among tramadol recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged that most included trials were at a high risk for bias due to incomplete outcome reporting, small sample sizes, and inconsistent assessment methods, factors that may have exaggerated benefits and underestimated harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reevaluating Tramadol’s Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the research, Jessica Otte, MD, clinical associate professor in the Department of Family Medicine at The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, said the new review stands out for examining tramadol’s use across a range of chronic pain conditions, an area where clinicians often struggle to help patients achieve meaningful and sustained relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otte, who has studied the drug’s safety and effectiveness through The University of British Columbia’s Therapeutics Initiative, said the Danish team’s analysis expands on earlier research that largely focused on single pain conditions. The findings, she said, add weight to growing evidence that challenges tramadol’s perceived advantages over other analgesics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This review doesn’t change the narrative but strengthens it: Tramadol’s reputation as a safer or uniquely effective opioid is increasingly difficult to defend,” she told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she believes the study makes an important contribution, Otte said the results should be interpreted with caution because of gaps in the underlying evidence. The Danish authors noted similar concerns, and Otte agreed that many of the included trials had methodological shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of the studies had biases that made us less certain about what was reported,” she said. “Many outcomes that matter to patients — like quality of life, functional improvement, or withdrawal — were either inconsistently measured or not reported at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that patients assigned to tramadol were more likely to discontinue early, both overall and because of side effects, raising concern about tolerability and attrition bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also commenting, Houman Danesh, MD, professor and medical director of pain management at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, said the review provides moderate-certainty evidence that tramadol increases the risk for serious adverse events; but its broad approach — evaluating efficacy and safety across multiple chronic pain conditions — could be a confounding factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tramadol may benefit some conditions more than others,” he noted, which could alter the overall risk-benefit profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his clinical experience, Danesh said severe complications such as cardiac events are uncommon. He explained that heart rhythm disturbances occasionally associated with tramadol generally arise when patients are taking other medications that affect cardiac conduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danesh emphasized that clinicians should weigh the study alongside other research and their own experience when deciding whether to prescribe the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to take this study into consideration,” he said, “but there are multiple studies that support the use of tramadol, and we have to look at the totality of the evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The authors declared no competing interests and received no specific grant from any funding agency. Otte and Danesh reported no relevant financial relationships.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 10:53:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQZ1RIcTA1dy1qTkMwejNvUXpKZVl2dURDUFY0ZnVCaWlyOVpvMnlSczlsWDVXRWZDRDZxbDNWaUpjU2gtRHVfY1BtZEtuZVJzeUZacHNnd1BlaEIyVFBpcTZpSTh3RXlDTzZyQ2UtMzR2XzJoU1hyUlpiWXp5WkFFdHAwWnA0bXduVS1CMVJxQUs</guid></item><item><title>70岁后没有人告诉你的关于性的9件事- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/brittanywong/things-no-one-tells-you-about-sex-after-70-sc</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of mystery surrounding &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/sex" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955843"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; in your 60s, 70s and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look online and you’ll find countless threads where curious younger people ask if &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-you-stop-having-sex-when-you-get-old" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955843" data-affiliate="true"&gt;older people are having sex at all,&lt;/a&gt; and if they are having it, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hzvnyg/what_is_sex_like_when_you_are_old_80/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955843"&gt;what it’s like&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeople/comments/ml9zzw/do_old_people_still_have_sex/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955843"&gt;“What does it feel like?”&lt;/a&gt; others wonder. (Good, we imagine? It’s still sex!) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mystery surrounding sex in older age stems from a combination of factors, according to &lt;a href="https://drshannonchavez.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955843" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Shannon Chavez&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed psychologist and sex therapist in  Beverly Hills, California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, societal taboos and ageist attitudes have led to a marginalization of older adults’ sexuality. No one wants to imagine people their grandparents’ or parents’ age having sex, so we cast out those thoughts. What we get as a result are limited discussions and representations of sex in later life; think of how few scenes we see of older people getting it on in movies and TV, and how often post-50 sex and Viagra are the butt of the joke for late-night comedians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re all going to get older eventually (hopefully, anyway) but because we’ve stigmatized post-50 sex so much, we’re ill-prepared for the realities of it, Chavez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lack of comprehensive sex education tailored to older age groups, leaving many individuals uninformed about the changes and challenges they may face regarding sexuality as they age,” she told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This all leads to misconceptions and curiosity about what sexual experiences are like in later life,” she said. “Overall, increased awareness, education, and open dialogue about sex and aging can help eliminate the mystery and promote healthier attitudes toward sexuality in older age groups.”&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that even a moderate dose of THC reduced internal connectivity in brain circuits responsible for emotional regulation, bodily awareness, sensory processing, and higher thinking. The findings help explain the mental and behavioral changes that many people experience when intoxicated with cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cannabis use continues to rise among young adults, scientists are increasingly focused on how the drug affects the brain. In particular, THC, the main compound responsible for the “high,” is drawing attention because of its potential to interfere with how different parts of the brain work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has shown that THC interacts with the brain’s natural cannabinoid system, a network that helps regulate mood, reward, attention, and sensory experiences. THC increases dopamine activity in this system, which can affect behavior and cognition. However, many earlier studies have only looked at specific brain circuits or have used small samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind this new study wanted to take a broader approach, examining THC’s effects across the entire brain. They used a type of brain imaging that measures how brain regions naturally coordinate with each other when a person is at rest, rather than performing a specific task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people use cannabis and we know little about how different cannabinoids like delta-9-THC impact the brain,” said study author Natania A. Crane, an assistant professor and director of the REWARD Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “Delta-9-THC is only one of the over 100 different cannabinoids that make up cannabis. Delta-9-THC is important because it is the main psychoactive compound of cannabis, linked to the addictive and rewarding properties of cannabis. We wanted to understand how delta-9-THC impacts communication between different areas of the brain compared to placebo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 33 young adults between 18 and 25 years old who occasionally used cannabis but were otherwise healthy. To isolate the effects of THC, each participant took part in two sessions. In one session, they received a 7.5 milligram dose of oral THC. In the other, they received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sessions were separated by several days, and participants did not know which substance they were receiving. About two hours after taking the pill — when THC’s effects are typically strongest — participants underwent a type of brain scan called resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the scan, participants stared at a fixed point while letting their thoughts wander. The researchers analyzed the brain data using a method that identifies patterns of activity across the whole brain. They examined both how well different parts of each network were working together (called “within-network connectivity”) and how well different networks were interacting with each other (“between-network connectivity”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After taking THC, participants reported stronger feelings of intoxication, as expected. But the brain data revealed more than just a general effect. THC reduced internal communication in several key networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most affected networks involved areas of the brain tied to memory, emotion, and motivation. These included regions like the hippocampus and basal ganglia. Other impacted networks were connected to sensory processing and spatial reasoning. For example, a network linking the parahippocampus and visual cortex showed weakened coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that THC disrupted communication between two networks that include the insula and anterior cingulate cortex — regions often associated with bodily awareness and emotional monitoring. Specifically, THC reduced the connection between the upper and lower parts of these networks, suggesting that these brain systems were not working together as smoothly when the participants were intoxicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study did not find a link between the strength of these brain changes and how high the participants felt or how often they used cannabis in the past month. This suggests that the observed changes in brain communication happen regardless of how intense the intoxication feels or how frequently someone uses the drug, at least among people who use it occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at how brain activity varied across different frequency bands — essentially, the rhythm of brain signals. They found that THC changed the amount of activity in both low and high frequency bands in certain networks, including those involved in self-awareness and emotional regulation. These changes may reflect shifts in how information is processed throughout the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings suggest that THC has widespread effects on how brain systems function together, especially in areas related to thinking, feeling, and sensing. These disruptions could help explain why cannabis use is linked with changes in attention, working memory, and emotional experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Among healthy young adults who occasionally use cannabis, delta-9-THC reduces connections throughout the brain compared to placebo. Specifically, we found that delta-9-THC acutely reduces connections between brain areas involved in emotion, interoception (internal sense of what is happening in your body), processing sensory information, and executive functioning,” Crane told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may help to explain why individuals who use cannabis often report that cannabis acutely decreases strong emotions, changes how they feel, and increases the intensity of perceptual experiences. It also helps to explain how cannabis acutely decreases attention, working memory, and other executive functioning measures- these networks aren’t communicating the way they usually do when someone is intoxicated with delta-9-THC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides a broader look at how THC affects the brain, but some limitations should be considered. The sample size was relatively small and included only occasional cannabis users without major psychiatric conditions. As a result, the findings might not apply to people who use cannabis more heavily or who have mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a moderate dose of THC, which may be lower than the amount found in some recreational products. Because the drug was given in a controlled lab setting, the results might differ from what happens when cannabis is smoked or consumed in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study relied on short brain scans taken during a single session. Longer or repeated scans could provide a more complete picture of how THC changes brain function over time. The researchers also note that their method, while sensitive, may not capture all aspects of how the brain responds to THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies may want to examine different doses of THC, include people with anxiety or depression, or compare THC with other compounds in cannabis, such as cannabidiol (CBD). The researchers are also interested in tracking how repeated cannabis use over time affects brain networks, especially in people who use the drug to manage mood symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am really interested in understanding how different cannabinoids impact the brain among individuals with psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety, who have high rates of cannabis use. So many patients I see report that they use cannabis to help with depression and/or anxiety. The research tells us that cannabis can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety acutely, yet over time regular cannabis use, especially cannabis with high delta-9-THC content, actually increases symptoms of depression and anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leads to a vicious cycle — using cannabis to relieve anxiety or depression, but these symptoms just get worse as use continues. I want to better understand the mechanisms of this—how cannabinoids like delta-9-THC act in the brain acutely and over time among individuals with psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.09.005" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Alters Limbic and Frontal Functional Brain Connectomes Among Young Adult Cannabis Users&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Zachary Anderson, Matthew Gunn, Emily Jones, Olusola Ajilore, K.Luan Phan, Harriet de Wit, Heide Klumpp, Vince Calhoun, and Natania A.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.growthspotter.com/2025/07/07/proposed-clermont-subdivision-would-redesign-deadly-lakeshore-drive/"&gt;Lakeshore Preserve&lt;/a&gt; is a proposed 149-home subdivision designated for 94.56 acres south of Lakeshore Drive and west of Autumn Avenue. The project’s site plan calls for lots ranging in size from 65 feet to 120 feet wide, including six lots on Lake Nellie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its proximity to Lakeshore Drive and CR 561, significant safety improvements were included with the potential development of Lakeshore Preserve, according to &lt;a href="https://www.growthspotter.com/2025/10/08/lake-board-approves-clermont-subdivision-redesigning-deadly-lakeshore-drive/"&gt;a report in GrowthSpotter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The county had been looking to develop to improve that intersection with a roundabout, but lacked the funding,” said Bill Ray, a consultant to Winter Park developer Integrative Development Group.  “We’re coming forward to assist with the funding of that, to get these transportation improvements completed concurrent with construction of the project and not at some ambiguous time in the future when the county gets the funding to move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-HeAkjiNV" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_HeAkjiNV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lakeshore Drive corridor has been the site of several traffic accidents and a few fatalities over the years due to high speeds, sharp-angled intersections, winding curves, and inadequate planning measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to research from Orlando-based &lt;a href="https://www.trafficmobility.com/"&gt;Traffic &amp;amp; Mobility Consultants&lt;/a&gt;, which did traffic analysis for the project, Lakeshore Drive has 64% more crashes than the statewide average for similar roads. The corridor experienced 37 crashes in five years from 2018 to 2022, and 21% resulted in incapacitating or fatal injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PUD site plan would realign the road in front of Lakeshore Preserve and create a new traffic circle, according to Ray, with the roundabout at the entrance to the subdivision acting as a traffic calming measure, forcing motorists to slow down. A second roundabout at the Y-shaped intersection of Lakeshore and C.R. 561 has been planned since 2024 and will also be built by developers.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The future land use map calls for at least 40% of the development to remain as open space, with up to 50% committed to open space should the PUD be adopted. As part of the PUD rezoning, about 59 acres within the Green Swamp Area of Critical State Concern would remain undeveloped in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lakeshore Preserve consists of four undeveloped parcels that were historically citrus groves, two currently designated Rural and two designated Green Swamp Rural Conservation. All four parcels are zoned Urban Residential and are seeking Planned Unit Development, or PUD, zoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two undeveloped parcels within the Green Swamp would be included in the project’s open space and consist of undisturbed wetland, wetland buffers, passive open space and an existing dirt ramp for water access. Using the dirt ramp, residents will be allowed an access point for launching canoes, kayaks and paddleboards.&lt;/p&gt;

(Lake County Property Appraiser)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commission Chair Leslie Campione confirmed that the homes in Lakeshore Preserve would not be issued a certificate of occupancy, which would allow residents to move in, until the roundabouts are completed.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“Those are my big issues on this one, addressing the conflict between the old zoning and the comp plan, fixing it with this and getting those two major improvements that will help improve the safety tremendously in that area,” she said. “…I’m anxious to be down there once those roundabouts are in and see how this all comes together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commissioners voted 4-1 in favor of approving the project, with Commissioner Anthony Sabatini as the sole ‘no’ vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think this is trying to make the best out of a problematic, difficult situation with the lack of planning along the Lakeshore Corridor in the past and then some of the zoning entitlements being handed out the way they were,” Commissioner Sean Parks said. “I think this is the best that we could get out of this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But can someone really be addicted to food in the same way they could be hooked on substances such as alcohol or nicotine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6LdTa5QAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;oi=ao"&gt;addiction psychiatrist and researcher&lt;/a&gt; with experience in treating eating disorders and obesity, I have been following the research in this field for the past few decades. I have written a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83078-6"&gt;textbook on food addiction, obesity and overeating disorders&lt;/a&gt;, and, more recently, a self-help book for &lt;a href="https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOooBA1XtZ9Uea0tv2baj9t8v7TXnaPW7WBf21RqvKUM-imc32kzO"&gt;people who have intense cravings and obsessions for some foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is still some debate among psychologists and scientists, a consensus is emerging that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.019"&gt;food addiction is a real phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of studies have confirmed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70338"&gt;certain foods – often those that are high in sugar and ultraprocessed&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7570/jomes25053"&gt;affect the brains and behavior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83116-0"&gt;of certain people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.112574"&gt;similarly to other addictive substances&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16065"&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, many questions remain about which foods are addictive, which people are most susceptible to this addiction and why. There are also questions as to how this condition compares to other substance addictions and whether the same treatments could work for patients struggling with any kind of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does addiction work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK597351/"&gt;neurobiological mechanisms of addiction&lt;/a&gt; have been mapped out through decades of laboratory-based research using neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.09.010"&gt;preexisting genetic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/adb0000870"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; set the stage for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-023-00034-y"&gt;developing an addiction&lt;/a&gt;. Regularly consuming an addictive substance then causes a rewiring of several &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.024"&gt;important brain systems&lt;/a&gt;, leading the person to crave more and more of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rewiring takes place in &lt;a href="https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOopjx6BZgKuKhvAdGDFBjZPHVbZiJSDRThQXyEsSsw4nYc1i8iV7"&gt;three key brain networks&lt;/a&gt; that correspond to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.024"&gt;key functional domains&lt;/a&gt;, often referred to as the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.06.011"&gt;reward system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2009.03.038"&gt;the stress response system&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2013-0054"&gt;the system in charge of executive control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, using an addictive substance causes the release of a chemical messenger &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine"&gt;called dopamine&lt;/a&gt; in the reward network, which makes the user feel good. Dopamine release also facilitates a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-018-0191-4"&gt;neurobiological process called conditioning&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a neural learning process that gives rise to habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the conditioning process, sensory cues associated with the substance start to have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00264"&gt;increasing influence over decision-making and behavior&lt;/a&gt;, often leading to a craving. For instance, because of conditioning, the sight of a needle can drive a person to set aside their commitment to quit using an injectable drug and return to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, continued use of an addictive substance over time affects the brain’s emotional or stress response network. The user’s body and mind build up a tolerance, meaning they need increasing amounts of the substance to feel its effect. The neurochemicals involved in this process are different than those mediating habit formation and include a chemical messenger called noradrenaline and internally produced opioids such as endorphins. If they quit using the substance, they experience &lt;a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments"&gt;symptoms of withdrawal&lt;/a&gt;, which can range from irritability and nausea to paranoia and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2021_288"&gt;negative reinforcement kicks in&lt;/a&gt;. This is the process by which a person keeps going back to a substance because they’ve learned that using the substance doesn’t just feel good, but it also relieves negative emotions. During withdrawal from a substance, people feel profound emotional discomfort, including sadness and irritability. Negative reinforcement is why someone who is trying to quit smoking, for instance, will be at highest risk of relapse in the week just after stopping and during times of stress, because in the past they’d normally turn to cigarettes for relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, overuse of most addictive substances progressively damages the brain’s executive control network, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prefrontal-cortex"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, and other key parts of the brain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1010654108"&gt;involved in impulse control and self-regulation&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the damage to these areas makes it more and more difficult for the user to control their behavior around these substances. This is why it is so hard for long-term users of many addictive substances to quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p class="youtube-classic-embed"&gt;&lt;span class="w-full flex justify-center !m-0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Scientists have learned more about what’s happening in a person’s brain when they become addicted to a substance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What evidence is there that food is addictive?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies over the past 25 years have shown that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22639"&gt;high-sugar and other highly pleasurable foods&lt;/a&gt; – often foods &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980018003762"&gt;that are ultraprocessed&lt;/a&gt; – act on these brain networks in ways that are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/foods-high-in-added-fats-and-refined-carbs-are-like-cigarettes-addictive-and-unhealthy-165441"&gt;similar to other addictive substances&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting changes in the brain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008"&gt;fuel further craving for and overuse of the substance&lt;/a&gt; – in this case, highly rewarding food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical studies have demonstrated that people with an addictive relationship to food demonstrate the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16065"&gt;hallmark signs of a substance use disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies also indicate that for some people, cravings for highly palatable foods go well beyond just a normal hankering for a snack and are, in fact, signs of addictive behavior. One study found that cues associated with highly pleasurable foods activate the reward centers in the brain, and the degree of activation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.071"&gt;predicts weight gain&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, the more power the food cue has to capture a person’s attention, the more likely they are to succumb to cravings for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies have also found that suddenly ending a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13507"&gt;diet that’s high in sugar can cause withdrawal&lt;/a&gt;, similar to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.019"&gt;when people quit opioids&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.09.013"&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive exposure to high-sugar foods has also been found to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.038000.114"&gt;reduce cognitive function and cause damage&lt;/a&gt; to the prefrontal cortex and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hippocampus"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, the parts of the brain that mediate executive control and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another study, when obese people were exposed to food and told to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-019-0484-z"&gt;resist their craving for it&lt;/a&gt; by ignoring it or thinking about something else, their prefrontal cortexes were more active compared with nonobese individuals. This indicates that it was more difficult for the obese group to fight their cravings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/thoughts-about-food-cause-fear-and-panic-in-royalty-free-illustration/2173543908?phrase=food%20addiction&amp;amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Viktar Sarkisian/iStock via Getty Images Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding safe treatments for patients struggling with food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addiction recovery is often centered on the idea that the fastest way to get well is to abstain from the problem substance. But unlike nicotine or narcotics, food is something that all people need to survive, so quitting cold turkey isn’t an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, eating disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bulimia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353615"&gt;bulimia nervosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/binge-eating-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353627"&gt;binge-eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-022-00411-0"&gt;often occur alongside addictive eating&lt;/a&gt;. Most psychologists and psychiatrists believe these illnesses have their root cause in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102937"&gt;excessive dietary restriction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, many eating disorder treatment professionals balk at the idea of labeling some foods as addictive. They are concerned that encouraging abstinence from particular foods could trigger &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102937"&gt;binge eating and extreme dieting to compensate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A way forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But others argue that, with care, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16132019"&gt;integrating food addiction approaches into eating disorders treatment&lt;/a&gt; is feasible and could be lifesaving for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emerging consensus around this link is moving researchers and those who treat eating disorders to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-024-01017-9"&gt;consider food addiction in their treatment models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such approach might look like &lt;a href="https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOooIfW4_BgKGysr2y90Cts7qyqjoKdpF5HIxXAiNMPY7rRHDYKI3"&gt;the one described to me&lt;/a&gt; by addiction psychiatrist and eating disorders specialist Dr. Kim Dennis. In line with traditional eating disorder treatment, nutritionists at her residential clinic strongly discourage their patients from restricting calories. At the same time, in line with traditional addiction treatment, they help their patients to consider significantly reducing or completely abstaining from particular foods to which they have developed an addictive relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1556988"&gt;clinical studies&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2024.107211"&gt;already being carried out&lt;/a&gt;. But going forward, more studies are needed to help clinicians find the most effective treatments for people with an addictive relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1542905"&gt;are underway&lt;/a&gt; by groups of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists and mental health providers to get “ultraprocessed food use disorder,” also known as food addiction, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000527322"&gt;into future editions of diagnostic manuals&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm"&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases"&gt;World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond acknowledging what those treating food addiction are already seeing in the field, this would help researchers get funding for additional studies of treating food addiction. With more information about what treatments will work best for whom, those who have these problems will no longer have to suffer in silence, and providers will be better equipped to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Before the pandemic helped fuel the growth of vaccine politicization across the country, less than 1% of Austin school district’s kindergarteners in the fall of 2019 failed to comply with the state’s vaccine reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Five years later, Austin ISD had some of the state’s highest number of kindergarteners who neglected those state requirements — about 1 in 5 kindergarteners had not proven they were fully vaccinated against measles and did not file an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A Texas Tribune analysis has found that this explosion of vaccine non-compliance has played out across many school districts in the state in recent years, helping to push Texas’ measles vaccine coverage to the lowest it’s been since at least 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We definitely were on a better trajectory [before the pandemic],” said Alana Bejarano, executive director of health services and nursing for the Austin school district, which reported a 23% delinquency rate for the measles vaccines among their kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I don't know that I can pinpoint the concrete answer, except [preschool and kindergarteners] were born at a time where everything kind of went off track and getting them back into that, you know, that's been difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Tribune examined kindergarten measles vaccination compliance because it’s the earliest the state documents school vaccination rates and measles can be especially deadly for young children. The state’s two measles deaths this year were girls ages 6 and 8. Under Texas vaccine requirements, most kindergarteners must show they are fully vaccinated against measles or file an exemption to enroll in school; most who are not fully vaccinated have an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;During the pandemic, the statewide measles vaccine delinquency rate — a term the Texas Department of State Health Services uses to track students not compliant with those requirements — more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Tribune estimated the number of vaccine-delinquent kindergarteners in each district by comparing delinquency rates and enrollment totals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In school districts with the most delinquent kindergarteners in the 2024-25 school year, the latest data available from the state, as much as 44% of their kindergarteners were delinquent in the measles vaccines, and their delinquencies also outnumbered exemptions, which was not the case at the state level. Those school districts had vaccine delinquency rates as small as a fraction of a percent just five years prior.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The five other vaccinations required for kindergarten followed similar increases in delinquency rates during the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The pandemic is the driving force behind the increase in vaccine delinquency, school district officials say. Many children are entering school after falling behind on their immunizations during the pandemic, making it an untenable task for resource-strapped school districts to chase after parents to vaccinate their children or submit an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Meanwhile, access to vaccines, especially free and low-cost doses, have also dwindled over the last several years amid funding cuts and the politicization of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State laws and rules don't dictate who has to enforce vaccine compliance, although the Texas Department of State Health Services administers the law and school districts have traditionally been among the first line of enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While school districts acknowledge they are enrolling students not compliant with state vaccine requirements, district officials say they are caught in a no-win situation. Pushing vaccines too hard could lead to retaliation from groups and politicians opposed to vaccine mandates, and district officials don’t want to disenroll students — public schools have a responsibility to educate all children and so much of their funding is tied to attendance, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We encourage our school nurses to advocate strongly to promote and protect public health at their campus,” Becca Harkleroad, executive director of the Texas School Nurse Organization. “But ultimately it’s up to the superintendent and the principal to decide how strictly they are going to enforce it or if they are going to enforce it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


  
  

  





    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Statewide, the percentage of kindergarteners who were delinquent in getting the measles vaccine more than doubled to 2.68% between 2019-20 and 2024-25, the latest data available. The delinquency rate jumped to 3.1% in 2021-22, surpassing the number of students who had an exemption. Those rates have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, although the exemption rate has returned to exceeding the delinquency rate.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that a year ago 25,000 Texas kindergarteners were not fully vaccinated against measles. Of those, more than 16,000 had an exemption, and about 9,000 did not have an exemption and under the state’s definition, were vaccine delinquent.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The overall vaccine delinquency rates may be small, but anything that causes vaccination levels to fall means more children are vulnerable. Ideally, schools try to keep their vaccination levels at 95% to help protect those children with compromised immune systems or medical conditions that keep them from being vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In addition to vaccine delinquency, the state also tracks the percentage of students who are vaccinated, formally exempt from vaccinations, and provisionally enrolled because of vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Most unvaccinated students in Texas are permitted to enroll because they have an exemption form or a note from a doctor. They can also provisionally enroll without proving vaccination status if they are homeless, military dependents or in foster care and their records cannot be obtained by the start of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Texas measles kindergarten vaccination rate of 93% is the lowest it's been since at least 2011, ranking the state 18th nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The decrease in vaccination rates overall is certainly a concern because it leaves our population vulnerable to different infections,” said Dr. Erin Nicholson, a pediatric infection physician at Texas Children’s Hospital and an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine. “And we saw that front and center with the measles outbreak that recently happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="9772a9c8-bc90-434e-961a-35f2985af4e1" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Schools: A first line of defense against infectious disease&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By the time most children enter kindergarten, they have received two MMR vaccination doses, &lt;a href="https://www.bswhealth.com/conditions/measles-rubeola/mmr-vaccine"&gt;which will provide lifelong protection&lt;/a&gt; against measles, as well as mumps and rubella for most people. The MMR vaccination for kindergarteners is considered one of the &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04"&gt;most important immunization targets by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State health officials audit school vaccination records each year for accuracy, by sampling school district records, explains Chris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. But there is nothing in state rules that requires DSHS to enforce the vaccination requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As a result, the de facto enforcement has traditionally fallen to school districts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Some of the state’s highest kindergarten measles delinquency rates were in larger school districts and charter networks: KIPP Texas Public Schools (44%), Spring ISD (30%), Austin ISD (23%), Dallas ISD (20%), and Houston ISD (7%).&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The five public school systems with the highest counts made up more than half of all delinquent kindergartners in the state, despite enrolling less than 10% of the state’s public school kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


  
  

  





    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Some district officials, including Dallas, say they try to follow state requirements by sending home students who do not have completed vaccination requirements or an exemption. But, they enroll those students, contributing to the district’s vaccine delinquency rate.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Austin school district will also enroll the students who don’t meet vaccine requirements, but they wait to send those students home until their parents have been notified of their vaccine delinquency three times, Bejarano said. They can return once they have proof of vaccination or the exemption form.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State data doesn’t track how many vaccine-delinquent students school districts send home. It also doesn't reflect changes to vaccine delinquency later in the year because the data is based on surveys school districts submit in the first half of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While some school districts say they try to send home students who don’t meet vaccine requirements, Houston ISD officials said they are keeping those students in the classroom. They, too, dedicate time and resources to track all students’ vaccination status and try to communicate information with parents about the need for staying up to date on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But, they are “not excluding students from learning based on vaccine status,” according to a statement to the Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Chanthini Thomas, a school nurse who retired from her job at Houston ISD’s Bellaire High School last summer, said the conflicting messages from the district, resource reductions and the yearlong chase to get vaccine paperwork in was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You have little support,” she said. “Why would you say…that’s a requirement to any school for the state of Texas but then you put out a mandate from the district to say, don’t let immunizations prevent enrollment? And the reason is because they need the numbers, because the numbers were dwindling.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Like many other urban school districts, HISD is battling &lt;a href="https://perc.tamu.edu/blog/2025/06/texas-enrollment.html?utm"&gt;declining enrollment&lt;/a&gt; — and the funding that comes with it — as more families move toward better job opportunities and lower housing costs in the suburbs or choose charter and private schools.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As school nurses have told the Tribune over the summer, school districts choose to enroll unvaccinated children so they can keep “butts in the seats” and the base amount of money they receive from state and local sources to educate each student — &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/28/texas-school-funding-explainer/#:~:text=When%20Texas%20school%20districts%20talk,meet%20each%20student%27s%20educational%20needs."&gt;about $6,160&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I see the school as being in a tough spot,” said Melissa Gilkey, a University of North Carolina professor who studies vaccine efforts at schools. “We work so hard to minimize absenteeism…that I do have some sympathy for that idea that it's hard to exclude them for one health service.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;KIPP Texas Public Schools, a charter network with campuses across the state, declined an interview but insisted it was following the state immunization requirements. Its kindergarten measles vaccine delinquency rate was less than 1% in 2019 compared to 44% last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Spring ISD, north of Houston, reported last year that more than 30% of its kindergarteners were measles vaccine delinquent. The district informed the Tribune it also follows state rules closely but said its high MMR delinquency rate was evidence of “enrollment and access issues” and that Spring ISD was “actively working to strengthen this process.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Spring district cited family’s frequent moves in the area, limited access to health care and language barriers as reasons there’s a delay in getting student shot records updated in time for school.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We are committed to improving compliance rates and ensuring our students are protected against preventable diseases,” said Shane Strubhart, the Spring ISD spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="b42ef658-3def-4a92-9836-45bc5d4f7878" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Access to vaccines has dwindled&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The pandemic disrupted preventive health care, becoming most apparent in some of the most recent kindergarten classes, filled with students born around the first COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic not only interrupted home and school life, experts say, it upended regular health checkups younger children typically receive before they start school and that impact continues to be felt today.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Families “going to see the doctors got off track for everyone during the pandemic,” Austin ISD’s Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;For low-income and immigrant families who already found health care access a challenge, more are struggling to find what Bejarano calls their “medical” home, a regular primary care doctor who can either vaccinate their children or answer concerns and perhaps direct them to the state’s exemption process if they feel strong enough to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“COVID didn't do vaccination or education and many other things as a whole, any favors,” said Jennifer Finley, executive director of health services for Dallas ISD. The district’s kindergarten measles delinquency rate jumped to 20% last school year compared to 1% during the 2019-20 school year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Diminished vaccine access is also a factor. Up until the early aughts, public health departments, churches and even lawmakers would hold free or low-cost immunization clinics over the summer for families.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In 2004, the Dallas school district turned away hundreds of students, who walked and drove to nearby clinics for free or low-cost vaccines, according to a Dallas Morning News article.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After the pandemic, those resources are even fewer.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It really stopped during the pandemic,” Finley said. “Some of the folks lost their funding.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Schools rely heavily on local public health departments to help them with vaccination clinics. Once the threat of COVID lessened, public health departments used those funds to add more staff and hold more vaccination clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But two things began &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/18/texas-school-vaccination-budget-cuts/"&gt;impacting vaccination efforts&lt;/a&gt; by local health departments. First, those leftover funds were clawed back early by the Trump administration this year, prompting some staff to look for other jobs, thereby causing staff shortages in public health vaccination departments. And second, public health officials suspect more immigrant families are shying away from vaccination because of stepped-up immigration efforts and deportations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Texas, there are an &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/18/texas-border-schools-donald-trump-mass-deportations/"&gt;estimated 111,000 undocumented children&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom do not qualify for state Medicaid health insurance coverage, attending school.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We typically have big lines and the waiting room is packed. Our whole lobby is packed,” Dr. Phil Huang, the director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, told the Tribune in August. “This year it has not been that way.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="5f7520ac-9c03-4c5f-80ee-dfb644eed4b2" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy changing school messaging&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After the pandemic, many parents watched as debates raged over the safety of the quickly-developed COVID-19 vaccine. As a result, they are asking more questions about all childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In many cases, parents are spreading MMR doses out and that, too, could be the reason for more kindergartners showing up with an incomplete vaccination status, Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The main concern [among parents] is basically, ‘Am I doing the right thing for my child, that is in their best interest and help me understand what the risks are of these infectious diseases that vaccines are trying to prevent,’” Nicholson, the Texas Children’s physician, said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Before COVID, many doctors adopted an imperial tone — “you should do this because I’m the expert,” she said. That changed after the pandemic. “We are looking at how we talk to these parents, because the last thing that we want to do is come across as condescending.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;School nurses have also worked tirelessly to try to find a winning formula to reach families of vaccine-delinquent kids. At a national school nurse conference in Austin this summer, an entire session was devoted to teaching nurses how to have tension-free conversations with parents who are skeptical of vaccine requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Ultimately, school nurses just want to inform parents of their two options to stay compliant with state rules: either provide proof of vaccination or an exemption, Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’ve made these large campaigns and we are really kind when they register, letting them know what is the law, what the exemptions [are],” Bejarano said. “I just think the district in general is understanding we need to do better when it comes to public health and getting these rates up.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The good news, she says, is that the greater efforts made by school nurses in the fall to try to help parents become vaccine compliant tends to push down the high delinquency rates by the end of the school year. Data provided to the Tribune by Austin ISD proved that out. That 23% delinquency rate for kindergartners recorded in the fall of 2024 fell drastically to 6% by May 2025 possibly due to the fear produced by the measles outbreak in the months prior.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I do think that everybody came together in the Austin community and really did try to push for that” compliance, Bejarano said. “And I think that’s why it helped the rate last year.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Finley points to other lesser-known reasons complicating the back-to-school vaccination picture. Among them, an influx of students came to Texas from other states, many already armed with vaccination exemptions or with incomplete vaccination histories who are having to be re-educated about Texas requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Starting Sept. 1, Texas parents can more easily obtain a vaccine exemption form by downloading it off the state’s website, but how that will impact the delinquency gap won’t be seen until data is released next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Nicholson, Finley, Bejarano and others say they would like to see more data that clearly explains the rising delinquency rate and how many students who were once marked delinquent end up becoming fully vaccinated or obtaining an exemption by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Does it mean, you know, people are just struggling with paperwork?” Nicholson said. “Or does it mean that really those vaccinations are falling?”&lt;/p&gt;

This makes the Maldives the first country in the world to achieve ‘triple elimination’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maldives has shown that with strong political will and sustained investment in maternal and child health, elimination of mother-to-child transmission of these deadly diseases, and the suffering they bring, is possible,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This historic milestone provides hope and inspiration for countries everywhere working towards the same goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mother-to-child transmission leads to infections that affect millions worldwide. In the WHO South-East Asia Region alone, provisional estimates indicate that in 2024, more than 23 000 pregnant women had syphilis and over 8000 infants were born with congenital syphilis. About 25 000 HIV-positive pregnant women required treatment to prevent transmission to their babies, while hepatitis B continues to affect more than 42 million people in the Region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maldives’ achievement is a testament to its unwavering commitment towards universal health coverage, to provide quality and equitable care across its dispersed islands to all, including migrants.” said Dr Catharina Boehme, Officer-in-Charge, WHO South-East Asia Regional Office. “This landmark feat is an important step towards ‘Healthy Beginnings, Hopeful Futures,’ for improving maternal and newborn health by ending preventable deaths and prioritizing long-term well-being. I congratulate Maldives and look forward to the country pioneering progress in many other areas, while sustaining these gains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Integrated care, universal health coverage and partnerships drive historic success&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over years, Maldives has built an integrated and comprehensive approach to maternal and child health. More than 95% of pregnant women receive antenatal care, with nearly universal testing for HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B. The country also has a strong immunization system, with over 95% of newborns consistently receiving a timely dose of hepatitis B birth dose and full vaccine coverage, protecting infants from lifelong infection. As a result, no babies were born with HIV or syphilis in 2022 and 2023, while a 2023 national survey confirmed zero hepatitis B among young children (first grade of school), surpassing elimination targets. These achievements are backed by universal health coverage, which guarantees free antenatal care, vaccines and diagnostic services for all residents, including migrants, supported by strong policies and investment of over 10% of GDP in health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This historic validation is a moment of immense pride for the Maldives and a reflection of our nation’s steadfast commitment to protecting mothers, children and future generations,” said H.E Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim, Minister of Health, Maldives. “Achieving triple elimination is not only a milestone for our health sector, but also a pledge by the Government to our people that we will continue to invest in resilient, equitable and high-quality health services that leave no one behind." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This milestone reflects strong partnerships between government, private health providers, civil society, and international partners, working together on screening, services, outreach, and technical support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Maldives’ triple elimination stands as a powerful example of how sustained investment in health systems, innovation, and community-based care can change the trajectory of public health, said Ms Payden, WHO Representative to Maldives. “WHO is proud to have partnered with the Government of Maldives and will continue to provide technical support to sustain this achievement and ensure that every child across all the islands have a healthy future."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sustaining progress for the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maldives will continue to strengthen its health system by integrating digital health information, expanding targeted interventions for key populations and migrants, enhancing private sector engagement and reporting and improving laboratory quality management. WHO will support Maldives to ensure sustained elimination efforts to advance progress for broader maternal, child and adolescent health goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="113" data-end="465"&gt;When you don’t have a romantic partner to come home to, you start engineering your own safety net. And no, that doesn’t mean “being tougher” or pretending you don’t need anyone. It means building habits that make you emotionally steady, day in and day out—habits that psychology consistently links to resilience, wellbeing, and long-term mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="467" data-end="629"&gt;Below are seven evidence-backed habits I keep seeing in people who stand strong without a life partner. Each habit is practical, humane, and—crucially—repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="636" data-end="707"&gt;1) They build a &lt;strong data-start="655" data-end="672"&gt;constellation&lt;/strong&gt; of support (not just one “person”)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="709" data-end="1048"&gt;People who thrive solo don’t try to replace a partner with a single best friend. They diversify. They maintain a few close confidants, keep up with family, and nurture “weak-tie” connections—baristas, gym acquaintances, neighbors. This web of ties spreads emotional load and increases the odds that someone is available when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1050" data-end="1418"&gt;It isn’t soft science: large meta-analyses show that strong social relationships predict better health and even lower mortality risk; quantity &lt;strong data-start="1193" data-end="1200"&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; quality matter. And &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2910600/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on “weak ties” finds that even brief, friendly exchanges boost belonging and mood—especially useful when you’re not returning to a partner each night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1420" data-end="1663"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1420" data-end="1433"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep a “social portfolio.” Each week: one deeper catch-up (walk or call), one casual touchpoint (DM or voice note), one weak-tie micro-interaction (ask the barista’s name, chat your building’s guard). These tiny touches compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1670" data-end="1734"&gt;2) They regulate mood &lt;strong data-start="1695" data-end="1715"&gt;through the body&lt;/strong&gt; (movement + sleep)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1736" data-end="1907"&gt;When you live alone, your nervous system doesn’t automatically co-regulate with a partner’s presence. So the disciplined soloist uses body-based levers to steady emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1909" data-end="1932"&gt;Two high-impact levers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="1934" data-end="2414"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="1934" data-end="2209"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1936" data-end="2209"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1936" data-end="1959"&gt;Steps, not heroics.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828073"&gt;2024 systematic review/meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; (33 studies; 96k adults) linked higher daily step counts to fewer depressive symptoms; ≥7,000 steps/day was associated with lower depression risk in prospective analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2210" data-end="2414"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2212" data-end="2414"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2212" data-end="2228"&gt;Sleep first.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7181893/"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt; connecting sleep and emotion show that poor sleep impairs emotion regulation; better sleep quality supports stability and healthier coping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2416" data-end="2586"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2416" data-end="2429"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Put a non-negotiable floor (e.g., 7,000–8,000 steps) and a sleep window (e.g., lights out by 11 p.m., devices parked). Treat these like meds you take daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2593" data-end="2674"&gt;3) They practice &lt;strong data-start="2613" data-end="2645"&gt;self-compassionate self-talk&lt;/strong&gt; (not pep-talks, &lt;em data-start="2662" data-end="2668"&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt; talk)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2676" data-end="3067"&gt;Without a partner saying “hey, you did your best,” emotionally independent people learn to say it to themselves—and it’s more than a feel-good slogan. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22796446/"&gt;Meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt; show self-compassion is robustly associated with less depression/anxiety and greater wellbeing. You’re not lowering standards; you’re lowering &lt;em data-start="2984" data-end="2997"&gt;self-attack&lt;/em&gt;, which frees energy for action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3069" data-end="3097"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3069" data-end="3095"&gt;Try this (30 seconds):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol data-start="3098" data-end="3288"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3098" data-end="3138"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3101" data-end="3138"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3101" data-end="3109"&gt;Notice&lt;/em&gt; the pain (“This is hard”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3139" data-end="3181"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3142" data-end="3181"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3142" data-end="3153"&gt;Normalize&lt;/em&gt; it (“Struggle is human”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3182" data-end="3288"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3185" data-end="3288"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3185" data-end="3194"&gt;Nurture&lt;/em&gt; yourself (“What’s one kind thing I can do next?”).&lt;br data-start="3245" data-end="3248"&gt;Repeat often, especially after mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3295" data-end="3352"&gt;4) They &lt;strong data-start="3306" data-end="3333"&gt;write their way through&lt;/strong&gt; difficult emotions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3354" data-end="3830"&gt;When you don’t have a built-in listener at home, a blank page can be one.&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/emotional-and-physical-health-benefits-of-expressive-writing/ED2976A61F5DE56B46F07A1CE9EA9F9F"&gt; Classic “expressive writing” protocols&lt;/a&gt;—15–20 minutes/day for 3–5 days about a stressful topic—show small but reliable benefits for physical and psychological health across many studies. Later work refines the picture (e.g., some populations benefit more; positive writing can also help), but the core idea holds: making meaning on the page helps metabolize stress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3832" data-end="4011"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3832" data-end="3845"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Set a 15-minute timer. Write your “deepest thoughts and feelings” about what’s hard—no grammar, no audience. End with two sentences about “what I control this week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4018" data-end="4091"&gt;5) They use &lt;strong data-start="4033" data-end="4063"&gt;smarter emotion regulation&lt;/strong&gt; (reappraisal &amp;gt; suppression)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4093" data-end="4664"&gt;Alone doesn’t mean armored. People who cope well solo don’t bottle feelings—they &lt;em data-start="4174" data-end="4183"&gt;reframe&lt;/em&gt; them. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12212647/"&gt;Foundational work&lt;/a&gt; on emotion regulation shows &lt;strong data-start="4236" data-end="4261"&gt;cognitive reappraisal&lt;/strong&gt; (changing how you interpret a situation) reliably reduces negative emotion and is generally more adaptive than suppression. Mindfulness programs (e.g., MBSR) also produce small-to-moderate reductions in stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in rigorous reviews. Together, these skills become your internal thermostat when nobody’s at home to help turn the dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4666" data-end="4902"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4666" data-end="4679"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; When a thought spikes (“I’m failing at this”), ask: &lt;em data-start="4732" data-end="4764"&gt;What’s another accurate story?&lt;/em&gt; (“I’m early in the curve; effort is data.”) If the mind won’t budge, sit for 60 seconds, eyes soft, counting breaths to 10 and back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4909" data-end="4985"&gt;6) They &lt;strong data-start="4920" data-end="4949"&gt;ask for help like a skill&lt;/strong&gt; (therapy, groups, guided self-help)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4987" data-end="5470"&gt;Emotionally independent doesn’t mean emotionally isolated. People who last without a partner tend to be &lt;strong data-start="5091" data-end="5104"&gt;proactive&lt;/strong&gt; about professional and peer support: therapy, skills groups, or guided online programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4987" data-end="5470"&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23870719/"&gt;cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&lt;/a&gt; remains a well-supported treatment for depression; network meta-analyses suggest multiple delivery formats (individual, group, phone, guided self-help) can be effective—use what’s accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5472" data-end="5536"&gt;Two upgrades that help when you don’t have a built-in confidant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5538" data-end="5770"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5538" data-end="5652"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5540" data-end="5652"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5540" data-end="5561"&gt;Ask specifically.&lt;/strong&gt; Replace “Can we talk?” with “Do you have 15 minutes tonight to help me think through X?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5653" data-end="5770"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5655" data-end="5770"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5655" data-end="5673"&gt;Set a cadence.&lt;/strong&gt; A monthly “maintenance” session (therapist or support group) prevents problems from stockpiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5777" data-end="5831"&gt;7) They &lt;strong data-start="5788" data-end="5831"&gt;anchor life in purpose and contribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5833" data-end="6300"&gt;A partner often supplies daily meaning: shared goals, routines, mirrors. Solo, you manufacture meaning—through mastery, service, community. Observational syntheses link &lt;strong data-start="6002" data-end="6018"&gt;volunteering&lt;/strong&gt; with better mental health and even survival (with the usual caveat that causality is complex).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5833" data-end="6300"&gt;More broadly, the &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-773"&gt;friendship literature&lt;/a&gt; shows that investing in supportive friendships—alongside purposeful activities—tracks with higher wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6302" data-end="6483"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6302" data-end="6315"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Pair one &lt;em data-start="6325" data-end="6334"&gt;mastery&lt;/em&gt; block (learning a skill 2–3 hours/week) with one &lt;em data-start="6384" data-end="6393"&gt;service&lt;/em&gt; block (a weekly shift, call tree, or mentoring slot). Purpose sticks when it’s scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8411" data-end="8426"&gt;A final word&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8428" data-end="8787"&gt;If you’ve been navigating life without a partner’s shoulder to lean on, you’ve probably built more strength than you give yourself credit for. The point isn’t to prove you don’t need people—it’s to create a life where support is &lt;strong data-start="8657" data-end="8672"&gt;distributed&lt;/strong&gt;: some from the body, some from the mind, some from friends and community, and some from professionals when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8789" data-end="9106"&gt;Psychology’s message is surprisingly hopeful here: you can &lt;em data-start="8848" data-end="8855"&gt;train&lt;/em&gt; resilience. Steps and sleep steady the system. Self-compassion softens the blow. Journaling creates coherence. Reappraisal and mindfulness give you levers. Help-seeking becomes a skill. Friendship and contribution make life larger than your problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9108" data-end="9342"&gt;Do a little, daily. Let the habits carry the weight that a single person might once have carried. Over time, you’ll feel something sturdy forming under your feet—a kind of quiet confidence that doesn’t depend on who’s waiting at home.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLEVELAND — More than 795,000 Americans &lt;a href="/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;experience a stroke&lt;/a&gt; each year, with nearly half of survivors living with physical disabilities. For decades, rehabilitation has been the only option for recovery, but a new FDA-approved surgical procedure is offering hope to stroke survivors who have exhausted traditional therapy options.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommy Fello, owner of Tommy's restaurant in Coventry, became the first patient in Ohio to receive the vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) implant at Cleveland Clinic after suffering a stroke on Christmas Day 2023. The stroke caused the left side of his body to be paralyzed, forcing him to rely on his family and 65 employees to keep his 53-year-old restaurant running.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I was scared out of my mind," Fello said, describing the moment he realized he couldn't move his left arm or leg. "When you have a business, you have a responsibility to all these people that work for you."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure involves implanting a small device in the chest, similar to a pacemaker, with a wire that wraps around the vagus nerve in the neck. During rehabilitation exercises, the device sends electrical pulses to stimulate brain pathways, potentially helping create new neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/vagal-nerve-stimulation-after-stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Dr. Mark Bain, the Cleveland Clinic neurologist &lt;/a&gt;who performed Fello's surgery, explained the procedure takes about an hour with small incisions in the neck and below the collarbone.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All we had to do was find that nerve which sits below the carotid artery, wrap this little stimulator around it and hook it up to a battery," Bain said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surgery is only the beginning. Patients must complete six to eight weeks of intensive occupational therapy, attending 90-minute sessions three times per week while the stimulator is activated. They also use a handheld magnet to trigger 30-minute stimulation sessions during daily activities at home.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four months after his procedure, Fello has regained enough function to drive his truck, walk up stairs to his restaurant office and interact with customers and staff. While his movements remain limited, requiring assistance from his unaffected right arm, he can now perform basic tasks that seemed impossible after his stroke.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Taking a shower, washing your face, shaving, going to the bathroom by yourself -- everyone takes advantage of the simplest things," Fello said. "The implant has given me the hope that it won't have to always be this way."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland Clinic has now performed eight VNS procedures for stroke recovery, with about 10 more patients scheduled. The treatment is available to stroke survivors with upper extremity weakness, typically at least six months post-stroke, though some patients have received the implant years after their initial stroke.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates must undergo evaluation by occupational therapy and rehabilitation specialists to determine if they fall within the appropriate range -- having some arm function that can potentially be amplified, but not so much that surgery isn't warranted.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical studies showed approximately 25% of patients who received the implant paired with rehabilitation experienced meaningful functional improvement after 90 days. The device builds on existing uses of vagus nerve stimulation, which has been used for years to treat seizure disorders.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a medical specialty, we do a really good job taking care of patients in the acute phase when they're having a stroke," Bain said. "But when you look at after you've had the stroke and if you do have symptoms at six months or something like that, there's not a lot for you."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure represents the only FDA-approved surgery specifically for stroke recovery, though insurance coverage remains inconsistent. Researchers are exploring whether the technology might help with other stroke-related deficits beyond arm weakness, including speech difficulties and lower extremity function.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Fello, the procedure has provided more than physical improvement. The forced slowdown from his previous schedule of working seven days a week, 14-15 hours daily, has allowed him to spend more time with his five daughters and 14 grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"God said, you know what, slow down," Fello reflected. "You have a beautiful family, beautiful grandkids. It took a stroke to make me remember that nothing's more important than family."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While long-term outcomes remain unknown since the procedure is relatively new, approximately 700 patients have received the implant across the United States. Stroke survivors interested in learning more can contact &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/neurological/depts/cerebrovascular" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Cleveland Clinic's Cerebrovascular Center &lt;/a&gt;or consult with their rehabilitation physician.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, with someone experiencing a stroke every 40 seconds. The American Heart Association emphasizes the need for improved access to post-stroke rehabilitation, particularly in rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geneva -- &lt;/em&gt;The World Health Organization sounded the alarm Monday over soaring numbers of drug-resistant bacterial infections, compromising the effectiveness of life-saving treatments and rendering minor injuries and common infections potentially deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations' health agency warned that one in six laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections worldwide in 2023 showed resistance to antibiotic treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings are deeply concerning," Yvan J-F. Hutin, head of the WHO's antimicrobial resistance department, told reporters. "As antibiotic resistance continues to rise, we're running out of treatment options and we're putting lives at risk." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria have long developed resistance against medicines designed to fight them, rendering many drugs useless. And that's been accelerated by the massive use of antibiotics to treat humans, animals and food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) superbugs directly cause over a million deaths and contribute to nearly five million every year, according to the WHO. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a report on AMR surveillance, the WHO examined resistance prevalence estimates for 22 antibiotics used to treat infections of the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, the bloodstream and those used to treat gonorrhoea.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the five years leading to up 2023, antibiotic resistance increased in over 40 percent of the monitored antibiotics, with an average annual rise of between five and 15 percent, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For urinary tract infections, resistance to commonly-used antibiotics was typically higher than 30 percent globally, it showed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report looked at eight common bacteria pathogens, including E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which can lead to severe bloodstream infections that frequently result in sepsis, organ failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO warned that more than 40 percent of E. coli infections and 55 percent of K. pneumoniae infections globally are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins -- the first-choice treatment for these infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nightmare-bacteria-drug-resistant-cases-increase-cdc-report/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;said last month that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; infection rates from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" jumped almost 70% between 2019 and 2023.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Flying blind"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO hailed improvements in surveillance but warned that 48 percent of countries still weren't reporting any AMR data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are definitely flying blind in a number of countries and regions that have insufficient surveillance systems for antimicrobial resistance," Hutin acknowledged.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judging from the available data, most resistance was found in places with weaker health systems and less surveillance, the WHO said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest resistance was found in the Southeast Asian and Eastern Mediterranean regions, where one-in-three reported infections were resistant. In the African region, one-in-five infections were resistant. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silvia Bertagnolio, who heads the WHO unit for antimicrobial resistance surveillance, told reporters it wasn't surprising that resistance would be higher in places with weaker health systems, since they may lack the capacity to diagnose or treat pathogens effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences could also be linked to the fact that countries with less surveillance may test and provide data on fewer patients and only those with the most serious infections, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has warned that there are not enough new tests and treatments in the pipeline to tackle the growing spread of drug-resistant bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is creating a significant "future threat," Hutin cautioned, adding that "the increasing antibiotic use, the increasing resistance and the reduction of the pipeline is a very dangerous combination."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;

The condition arises when the arteries located in the heart begin to narrow, making it more difficult for oxygen-rich blood to reach the heart muscle. It occurs due to a build up of plaque within the lining of these arteries (also known as atherosclerosis), says &lt;a href="https://cardiology.uw.edu/people/faculty/yang-e" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Eugene Yang;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Eugene Yang&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of medicine and Carl and Renée Behnke Endowed Chair for Asian Health at the University of Washington School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No one wants high blood pressure. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-one-wants-high-blood-090047558.html" data-ylk="slk:Here's the secret to keeping it low (but not too low).;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Here's the secret to keeping it low (but not too low).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What causes heart disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can’t control your family history, sex, age and menopausal status. But in the world of prevention, there are a number of modifiable lifestyle and health factors where you make adjustments to reduce your risk for heart disease, says &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/karol-watson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Karol Watson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Karol Watson&lt;/a&gt;, the co-director of the UCLA Program in Preventive Cardiology and director of the UCLA Women's Cardiovascular Health Center. A few long-established modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease include high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/11/19/surgeon-general-smoking-disparities-persist/76408802007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In many past studies, the parameters that researchers used to define whether someone had a risk factor for heart disease was a clinical diagnosis, but it’s likely not that simple. Rather, risk factors operate on a more linear scale, says &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=11644" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Philip Greenland;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Philip Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of cardiology at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;New research reveals that the modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease, even “at relatively low levels, can still convey risk,” says Greenland. According to a new study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.014" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American College of Cardiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;, 99% of the people who experienced a heart attack, stroke or heart failure had been exposed to at least one of the four risk factors – blood cholesterol, blood pressure, blood glucose or smoking — above an acceptable level. Greenland, who is one of the senior authors of the study, says it was important for researchers to evaluate multiple measurements, “because risk factors tend to fluctuate a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study in JACC didn't depend on clinical diagnoses to determine one’s risk for high cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure. Instead, researchers repeatedly measured populations in both Korea and the U.S. to determine whether someone had a modest risk elevation for those factors.

On this day, someone to remember is Rudolf Virchow [1821-1902], a German physician, pathologist and politician, referred by his colleagues as the “Pope of Medicine.” His famous postulate: that for blood to clot, three factors are needed -- stagnation, injury to vessel wall and abnormalities in clotting mechanism -- remains unchallenged to this day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Understanding clotting&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clotting is important because it can be symptomless and yet cause sudden death. Clotting in the veins of the legs - &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/need-for-awareness-of-dvt/article257669.ece" target="_self"&gt;acute deep vein thrombosis&lt;/a&gt; in medical terms - which sometimes floats its way to the lungs (&lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/prevent-the-preventable/article67551384.ece" target="_self"&gt;pulmonary embolism&lt;/a&gt;) is the most preventable cause of hospital deaths and a source of substantial long-term morbidity. About 120 of every 1 lakh persons are affected by this malady. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common causes of thrombosis are prolonged immobility due to trauma, spinal cord injuries resulting in paralysis, major neurosurgery, pelvic surgery or orthopaedic surgery, especially hip and knee replacement surgeries, and extended stays in intensive medical care units. Some diseases such as cancers and certain viral infections also interfere with the coagulation cascade and can promote a clot. The common viral infection H1N1, causes a 23.3-fold higher incidence of pulmonary embolisms and 19.9-fold higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis. A number of patients recovering from chicken pox, a viral disease, also present with clots in their legs. Drugs including oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies and some cancer drugs also promote clots in the veins.  Catheters left in the central veins for a prolonged period also promote clots. Physiological stagnation and clotting can also occur during pregnancy and the early postpartum period. Smoking is a definite cause for atherosclerosis as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;How clotting occurs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person is immobile, blood stagnates in the veins of the legs, the soleal veins, and promotes clot formation in the valves present in those veins. This is worsened by inactivity of the calf muscles. Calf muscles act as a pump, pushing the blood upwards to the heart. They are considered the peripheral heart or second heart. Any form of mobility such as walking, climbing stairs, running or cycling pumps venous blood from the lower limbs towards the heart, and hence should be vigorously encouraged in normal populations as well as those convalescing from various diseases or recovering from major surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why clots in the legs are bad: first such a clot can detach itself from the walls of the leg veins, move all the way to the lungs, choke them and cause sudden death. Most often this is so sudden that there is no time to even plan a definite treatment to save these patients. Second, these clots can recanalise but also cause narrowing of the blood vessels of the lung. They may not end in sudden death but can cause severe breathlessness even with minimal exertion leading to pulmonary hypertension. And lastly, the leg veins and the valves where the clots form, can be permanently damaged.  They lose their capacity to pump blood upwards to the heart, leading to constant pooling of blood in these veins. The ‘second heart’ therefore is damaged forever. Rarely, massive thrombosis in leg veins can result in gangrene of the limb and even death. Hence prevention is the best primary choice, and in cases where a clot has occurred, very early diagnosis and prompt treatment to prevent the growth and migration of the clots and prevent vein valve damage is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Prevention and treatment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does one prevent these dreadful clots? While prevention of vessel wall injury or inherent defects in the clotting mechanism may not be possible, stagnation can certainly be avoided through the aggressive promotion of physical exercises and adequate hydration to keep the blood optimally diluted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any exercise, starting from the simple tiptoe exercise to running, helps prevent stagnation. Prolonged immobility in any long-distance journey predisposes an individual to venous stagnation. Walking inside an aircraft especially in long-haul flights is a proven way to prevent clots, as is good hydration. Avoid alcohol on long flights because inebriation adds to immobility. If it is a car journey, break the journey every three or four hours get out and walk around a little, and stay hydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a surgery is planned, especially a knee or hip replacement, a discussion should be had with the surgeon about anti-clot protocols and early ambulation. Similarly, for those who are bed ridden for a long time, compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices are available. A doctor will be able to guide patients as to which one would be appropriate. In some instances, filters placed in the great vein, inferior vena cava, can prevent the migration of clots from the legs to the heart. There are very specific indications for such procedures and the treating doctor would be the best person to decide that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a clot in the leg veins is detected, prompt treatment is needed. In select cases, clot dissolving chemicals commonly known as clot busters, can prevent damage to the veins and vein valves. In severe cases, surgical removal of the clots from the lower limbs or from the pulmonary blood vessels may be lifesaving. A specialist is best placed to decide on treatment, depending on the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Move your limbs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all diseases and disorders, prevention is the best strategy. Stay hydrated, stay mobile and those who have inherent abnormalities in clotting factors should continue clot preventing medications unless specifically stopped by the treating doctor. Smoking and consumption of alcohol promote arterial thrombosis and are best avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Dr. J.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their research reveals why the first movements of electrons, which are crucial for transferring energy, occur through only one side of a key protein-pigment structure. The findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photosynthesis is a sequence of reactions in which electrons pass between multiple pigment molecules. Although it has been examined for decades, the process remains difficult to fully explain because it involves numerous intricate components, operates at extremely fast timescales, and varies slightly across different species. Gaining a deeper understanding of these steps could help scientists develop efficient artificial systems, such as synthetic leaves and solar-based fuel technologies, that replicate nature's design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most life forms that use photosynthesis, the process begins with a protein-pigment complex known as Photosystem II (PSII). This complex captures sunlight and splits water molecules, releasing oxygen and sending electrons onward to other molecules in the chain of energy transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSII contains two nearly identical branches, known as D1 and D2, surrounded by four chlorophyll molecules and two related pigments called pheophytins. These are symmetrically arranged and connected to electron carriers known as plastoquinones. In theory, electrons should move from chlorophyll to pheophytin and then to plastoquinone along both branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, experiments have consistently shown that electrons move only through the D1 branch -- a finding that has baffled scientists for years. "Despite the structural symmetry between the D1 and D2 protein branches in PSII, only the D1 branch is functionally active," explains Aditya Kumar Mandal, the study's first author and a PhD student in the Department of Physics at IISc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this imbalance, the team combined molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanical analyses, and Marcus theory (a Nobel Prize-winning model that describes how electrons are transferred) to chart the energy patterns in both pathways. "We assessed the electron transfer efficiency step-by-step through both D1 and D2 branches," says Shubham Basera, PhD student in the Department of Physics and one of the authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that the D2 branch has a much higher energy barrier, which makes electron transport energetically unfavourable. Specifically, the transfer of electrons from pheophytin to plastoquinone in D2 requires twice as much activation energy as D1 -- a barrier that electrons seem unable to overcome, preventing energy from flowing forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also simulated the current-voltage characteristics of both branches and found that the resistance against electron movement in D2 was two orders of magnitude higher than that in D1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asymmetry in electron flow may also be influenced by subtle differences in the protein environment around the PSII and how the pigments are embedded in it, the researchers suggest. For example, the chlorophyll pigment in D1 has an excitation state at a lower energy than its D2 counterpart, suggesting that the D1 pigment has a better chance of attracting and transferring electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also suggest that tweaking some of these components can boost or rewire electron flow across PSII. For example, swapping chlorophyll and pheophytin in D2 could overcome the electron block, because chlorophyll needs lower activation energy than pheophytin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research presents a significant step forward in understanding natural photosynthesis," says Prabal K Maiti, Professor at the Department of Physics and one of the corresponding authors of the study. "These findings may help design efficient artificial photosynthetic systems capable of converting solar energy into chemical fuels, contributing to innovative and sustainable renewable energy solutions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful combination of theory at various levels to address a long-standing problem culminating in a new level of understanding, but still leaving mysteries to be challenged, says Bill Goddard, Professor at Caltech and one of the corresponding authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Many fitness experts believe heavy lifting delivers faster results. However, a shocking warning by a CMC Vellore trained physician and top neurologist Dr. Sudhir Kumar, has cautioned everyone. Dr. Sudhir warned that during maximal weight lifting, blood pressure can rise to extremely high levels and can even surpass beyond 300 mmHg, especially when techniques like the Valsalva maneuver are used. Even though this is a temporary spike, the effects of this surge can lead to different consequences for different individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sudhir Kumar also mentioned that controlled studies with experienced bodybuilders have documented average peak systolic pressures of 320 mmHg during double-leg press exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Natural Ways to Control High Blood Pressure Effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3980383/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;1985 study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that during maximal double-leg press exercise, the mean peak systolic blood pressure was 320 mmHg, with one subject's reading exceeding 480 mmHg. The researchers noted that these extreme elevations were transient and returned to baseline levels shortly after the exercise concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.asep.org/asep/asep/Gotshall.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;1999 research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; observed that blood pressure increased progressively with each subsequent set of heavy resistance exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peak systolic blood pressures were recorded as 238 mmHg in the first set, escalating to 293 mmHg by the third set, highlighting the cumulative cardiovascular stress during intense lifting sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies also demonstrate that heavy resistance exercises, particularly those involving large muscle groups like the double-leg press, can induce significant and transient elevations in systolic blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why blood pressure spikes during heavy lifting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During heavy resistance training, particularly maximal lifts, the body undergoes significant cardiovascular stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-025-01097-3" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;As per studies,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; one of the primary contributors to sudden spikes in blood pressure during such exercises is the Valsalva maneuver. When performing the Valsalva maneuver, intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressures increase sharply, which helps stabilize the spine and provides a solid base for lifting heavy weights. However, this same pressure compresses major blood vessels, temporarily reducing venous return to the heart. As a result, the heart must work harder to pump blood through a partially restricted circulatory system, causing systolic blood pressure to spike dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who might face serious risks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his post, neurologist Dr. Sudhir adds, in a healthy person, with normal heart functions, this transient rise in BP does not lead to any adverse health issues. BP returns to normal levels soon after the exercise is over. However, the combination of high intrathoracic pressure and elevated BP means that individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, uncontrolled hypertension, or vascular abnormalities may face higher risks during these maneuvers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals with hypertension:&lt;/strong&gt; Those with pre-existing high blood pressure may experience exaggerated BP responses during intense lifting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Older adults:&lt;/strong&gt; Age-related changes in vascular elasticity can increase the risk of complications during heavy lifting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals with heart conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; Conditions like arrhythmias or heart disease can be exacerbated by significant BP fluctuations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Untrained individuals: &lt;/strong&gt;Lack of conditioning can lead to improper technique and increased cardiovascular strain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for healthy individuals, it is essential to practice proper breathing techniques and avoid breath-holding to minimize unnecessary strain on the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transient warning signs of high blood pressure may include sudden or severe headaches, dizziness or lightheadedness, blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, and even unexplained nosebleeds.

The findings, presented at the ECNP congress in Amsterdam, mark the first study to explain how ADHD and creativity are connected.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Han Fang (from the Radboud University Medical Centre, the Netherlands) explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previous research pointed to mind wandering as a possible factor linking ADHD and creativity, but until now no study has directly examined this connection. We conducted two studies, utilizing 2 different groups of ADHD patients and healthy controls, one from a European group curated by the ECNP, and a second study from a UK group. In total there were 750 participants. Separately analyzing results from 2 independent groups means that we can have greater confidence in the results."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team explored how ADHD traits, creativity, and functional challenges interact, focusing on the influence of mind wandering. Both groups displayed typical ADHD traits, including inattention, impulsivity, and frequent shifts in focus away from the task at hand. In both studies, participants with more pronounced ADHD symptoms also reported higher levels of mind wandering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering refers to moments when attention drifts away from what a person is doing and turns inward to self-generated thoughts. Everyone experiences this to some extent, but it occurs more frequently in individuals with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han Fang added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previous researchers have been able to distinguish two different types of mind wandering. It can be a loss of concentration, where your mind may drift from subject to subject. This is 'spontaneous mind-wandering'. Another type is 'deliberate mind wandering', where people give themselves the freedom to drift off-subject, where they 'allow their thoughts to take a different course'. Psychiatrists have developed ways of measuring how much people are subject to these different tendencies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also measured creativity in both groups (there are standards ways of measuring this, for example by asking people to find a creative use for an everyday object). They then looked at how creativity was associated with the different types of mind wandering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Han Fang said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that people with more ADHD traits such as lack of attention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity, score higher on creative achievements in both studies. This supports previous research. Additionally, we found that mind wandering, particularly deliberate mind wandering, where people allow their "thoughts to wander on purpose," was associated with greater creativity in people with ADHD. This suggests that mind wandering may be an underlying factor connecting ADHD and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may have practical implications, for both psychoeducation and treatment. For psychoeducation, specially designed programs or courses that teach individuals how to utilize their spontaneous ideas, for example turning them into creative outputs, could help individuals with ADHD traits harness the benefits of mind wandering. For treatment, ADHD-tailored mindfulness-based interventions that seek to decrease spontaneous mind wandering or transform it into more deliberate forms may reduce functional impairments and enhance treatment outcomes. This is the first time this link has been investigated, so we need to see more studies which confirm the findings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting, K.P. Lesch (Professor of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Würzburg, Germany) said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mind wandering is one of the critical resources on which the remarkable creativity of high-functioning ADHD individuals is based. This makes them such an incredibly valuable asset for our society and the future of our planet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The rate now mirrors that seen in younger adults, according to findings presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is one of the first to use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data to reveal that older adults -- often left out of overdose analyses -- are increasingly part of the national surge in fentanyl-stimulant deaths. People in this age group face higher risks of overdose because many manage chronic illnesses, take multiple medications, and metabolize drugs more slowly as they age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts describe the opioid epidemic as unfolding in four distinct "waves," each tied to a different drug driving fatal overdoses: prescription opioids in the 1990s, heroin beginning around 2010, fentanyl taking hold in 2013, and a combination of fentanyl and stimulants emerging in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A common misconception is that opioid overdoses primarily affect younger people," said Gab Pasia, M.A., lead author of the study and a medical student at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine. "Our analysis shows that older adults are also impacted by fentanyl-related deaths and that stimulant involvement has become much more common in this group. This suggests older adults are affected by the current fourth wave of the opioid crisis, following similar patterns seen in younger populations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, researchers examined 404,964 death certificates listing fentanyl as a cause of death from 1999 to 2023, using data from the CDC Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) system. Of those deaths, 17,040 involved adults 65 and older, while 387,924 were among adults aged 25 to 64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2015 and 2023, fentanyl-related deaths rose from 264 to 4,144 among older adults (a 1,470% increase) and from 8,513 to 64,694 among younger adults (a 660% increase). Within the older population, deaths involving both fentanyl and stimulants grew from 8.7% (23 of 264 fentanyl deaths) in 2015 to 49.9% (2,070 of 4,144) in 2023 -- a staggering 9,000% rise. In comparison, among younger adults, fentanyl-stimulant deaths rose from 21.3% (1,812 of 8,513) to 59.3% (38,333 of 64,694) over the same period, a 2,115% increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers chose to highlight 2015 and 2023 in their analysis because 2015 marked the beginning of the epidemic's fourth wave, when fentanyl-stimulant deaths among older adults were at their lowest, and 2023 represented the most recent year of CDC data available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the rise in fentanyl deaths involving stimulants in older adults began to sharply rise in 2020, while deaths linked to other substances stayed the same or declined. Cocaine and methamphetamines were the most common stimulants paired with fentanyl among the older adults studied, surpassing alcohol, heroin, and benzodiazepines such as Xanax and Valium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"National data have shown rising fentanyl-stimulant use among all adults," said Mr. Pasia. "Because our analysis was a national, cross-sectional study, we were only able to describe patterns over time -- not determine the underlying reasons why they are occurring. However, the findings underscore that fentanyl overdoses in older adults are often multi-substance deaths -- not due to fentanyl alone -- and the importance of sharing drug misuse prevention strategies to older patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors noted anesthesiologists and other pain medicine specialists should:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Recognize that polysubstance use can occur in all age groups, not only in young adults.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Be cautious when prescribing opioids to adults 65 or older by carefully assessing medication history, closely monitoring patients prescribed opioids who may have a history of stimulant use for potential side effects, and considering non-opioid options when possible.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Use harm-reduction approaches such as involving caregivers in naloxone education, simplifying medication routines, using clear labeling and safe storage instructions and making sure instructions are easy to understand for those with memory or vision challenges.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Screen older patients for a broad range of substance exposures, beyond prescribed opioids, to better anticipate complications and adjust perioperative planning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Older adults who are prescribed opioids, or their caregivers, should ask their clinicians about overdose prevention strategies, such as having naloxone available and knowing the signs of an overdose," said Richard Wang, M.D., an anesthesiology resident at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago and co-author of the study. "With these trends in mind, it is more important than ever to minimize opioid use in this vulnerable group and use other pain control methods when appropriate. Proper patient education and regularly reviewing medication lists could help to flatten this terrible trend."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The arteries, that carry oxygen, promote blood circulation, can accumulate plaque over time, known as atherosclerosis. The accumulation of this cholesterol, fat or calcium, can clog the arteries, elevate blood pressure, can lead to a heart stroke or disease. While no "one drink" can help improve the build up of plaque, there are several that ensure a healthy blood flow to the arteries. This is done by reducing inflammation, lowering bad cholesterol and circulating more efficiently. It is to be noted that making plaque disappear is not possible, but with lifestyle changes it may can shrink and stabilize- (Harvard health)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Green Tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9871939/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Green tea &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;has been highly prized in conventional medicine for centuries, and most research confirms its excellent reputation for heart health. Its active ingredients, or catechins, are potent antioxidants that reduce LDL cholesterol and oxidative stress, two prime players in keeping plaque buildup to a minimum. Daily use of green tea also enhances endothelial function, or how the inner blood vessel wall functions. Endothelial function helps blood flow smoothly and makes arteries flexible. Research indicates that consuming two to three cups of freshly brewed green tea daily might reduce coronary artery disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packaged green tea is to be avoided since it contains added sugars, which will neutralize its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pomegranate Juice&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most potent natural antioxidants, like punicalagins and anthocyanins, that combat inflammation and oxidative stress in the arteries, is present in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3678830/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;pomegranate juice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. In a study conducted by National Library of Medicine, daily consumption of pomegranate juice was found to decrease the progression of plaque in carotid arteries and enhanced circulation. The flavonoids in the fruit also block cholesterol oxidation in the blood, the first step towards the prevention of plaque buildup. To get the best out of it, consume unsweetened, plain pomegranate juice, or mix seeds into a smoothie to keep fiber and reap the best antioxidant benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beetroot Juice&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10281958/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Beetroot juice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is gaining popularity among athletes due to its great health benefits, but it is also good for the heart.

A daily glass of this milk and a pinch of turmeric and black pepper, will help the arteries produce more blood and potentially cut-back on plaque buildup.
