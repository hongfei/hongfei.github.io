Every year, an estimated &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17703-norovirus" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;684 million&lt;/a&gt; people globally come down with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus is a kind of infectious gastroenteritis, “an inflammation of the bowel and the colon that can cause diarrhea” and vomiting, explains Dr Ambreen Allana, an infectious disease physician based in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus can spread year-round, but has earned the nickname “winter vomiting illness” because it peaks from December to February in the northern hemisphere, says Dr Laraine Washer, medical director of infection prevention and epidemiology at the University of Michigan’s school of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-norovirus-spread" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does norovirus spread?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus is highly contagious. The virus typically enters the gastrointestinal tract via tiny viral particles from an infected person’s saliva or feces. These particles may end up on your hands, or in food or drink, and ultimately in your mouth – “what we call the fecal-oral route”, Washer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Particles remain infectious for up to &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-long-do-norovirus-germs-live-on-household-and-office-surfaces" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two weeks&lt;/a&gt; on hard surfaces like doorknobs and bathroom fixtures, and it takes very little exposure to make you sick. “The infectious dose of noroviruses is less than 20 virus particles,” says Washer. (Covid-19, by contrast, needs an exposure of &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20503121221115053" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;100-400&lt;/a&gt; virus particles to infect.) “When somebody has an active norovirus infection, there’s billions of virus particles per gram of stool,” says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is also some risk of transmission via aerosolized particles, particularly if you’re around someone while they are experiencing symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus becomes contagious about two days prior to the onset of symptoms, and people can remain contagious for days or even weeks after they’re feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Close quarters such as eldercare facilities, daycares and airports are a “perfect nidus for catching infection”, says Allana. Cruise ships are particularly notorious: the CDC has reported 16 norovirus outbreaks on ships stopping in US ports in 2025 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-norovirus" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The onset of norovirus symptoms can feel sudden, starting with abdominal cramping, sweating, chills, nausea, vomiting and “very watery diarrhea”, says Washer. Most cases are “mild” in the medical sense, meaning they resolve within three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nonetheless, it’s an extremely unpleasant illness. “People can feel pretty wiped out, fatigued; they may have a low-grade fever, headache. And in most cases, individuals are not able to continue doing their normal activities,” says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="do-i-need-medical-care-for-norovirus" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need medical care for norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Each year, norovirus causes &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3739528/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;570-800&lt;/a&gt; deaths and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cid/ciu120" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;70,000&lt;/a&gt; hospitalizations in the US, with people over 65 at greatest risk. Those most likely to have severe norovirus are “children less than five years of age, and especially older individuals and those who are immunocompromised”, says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Those in higher-risk age categories are also particularly susceptible to kidney injury due to dehydration from excessive diarrhea, says Allana. If you or a family member is in a higher-risk age category and unable to keep down liquids, Allana recommends seeing your doctor or going to your local emergency department to receive IV fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most adults and older children without underlying conditions recover from norovirus without medical intervention. While the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/outbreak-basics/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; 2,500 norovirus outbreaks annually in the United States, the actual number of infections is closer to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3739528/#:~:text=19%E2%80%9321%20million%20total%20illnesses%20per%20year" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;21m&lt;/a&gt; – most cases go unreported because people can “deal with their infections at home”, says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there’s nothing you can do to shorten the duration of a bout of norovirus, it’s important to stay hydrated throughout. “Try drinking the same amount of Gatorade or water as the volume that comes out,” says Allana. “Ice chips, ice lollies – really anything you can keep down that will keep you hydrated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An antiemetic – medication that prevents nausea and vomiting – like Dramamine may be necessary if you can’t keep liquids down. Do not, however, take medicines that stop diarrhea, like Imodium or Pepto-Bismol, says Washer. “Our body is trying to get rid of the infection, and if we keep the viruses inside … they stick around for longer periods of time,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"index":19,"listId":6039,"identityName":"well-actually","description":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life","name":"Well Actually","frequency":"Weekly","successDescription":"You are subscribed","theme":"lifestyle","idApiUrl":"https://idapi.theguardian.com"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-you-avoid-getting-norovirus" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you avoid getting norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;We don’t have a norovirus vaccine yet. That’s because norovirus is “incredibly difficult” to grow and study in labs, says Dr Andrea Love, an immunologist and microbiologist who has &lt;a href="https://news.immunologic.org/p/its-the-most-violently-ill-time-of" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about norovirus on her Substack. The virus has many different strains, which mutate frequently, making broad protection challenging, Love explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That leaves the basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wash your hands: &lt;/strong&gt;“To prevent or control outbreaks, good handwashing is important for everyone,” advises a representative from the CDC via email. “Importantly, infected individuals should not prepare or handle food, or care for others when they are sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hand sanitizer and other alcohol-based disinfectants do not work against norovirus, because of how the virus is structured. “You can use hand sanitizers in addition to handwashing, but hand sanitizer alone does not work well against norovirus and is not a substitute for handwashing,” according to the CDC spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, with good-quality soap, for at least 20 seconds, says Allana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid using an infected person’s bathroom: &lt;/strong&gt;If possible, designate a separate bathroom for the sick person in your household until they recover, and limit other contact, Washer suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean affected items: &lt;/strong&gt;Clean surfaces with diluted bleach (1 cup per gallon of water) or undiluted 3% hydrogen peroxide, both of which can kill norovirus. Wear disposable gloves when cleaning a bathroom where someone has been sick, and take reasonable precautions when working with strong chemicals, says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When travelling, such as on an airplane, use a paper towel when touching surfaces like the washroom tap and door handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Strong chemical agents are required to kill norovirus, and most disinfecting wipes don’t do the trick. But you may be able to find specialized bleach wipes at medical supply stores. Wear protective gloves while using them, and leave them on any contaminated surface for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthmdc.com/documents/EnvironmentalCleaning.pdf#:~:text=at%20high%20temperature%20greater%20than%20170%C2%B0F" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;laundry&lt;/a&gt;, wash and dry contaminated items separately on hot (norovirus can survive temperatures up to 158F or 70C), with bleach if possible. Running a bleach cycle of the washer in between loads won’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid communal dining: &lt;/strong&gt;Take extra steps to limit exposure. Buffets and potlucks pose particular risks, since multiple people handle serving utensils, and food comes from different kitchens. “If you really want to decrease your risk, avoiding potlucks around this time of year might be helpful,” Washer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you do get norovirus, continue taking precautions after recovery, and don’t assume immunity will protect you for long. “We don’t develop robust memory immunity to norovirus,” says Love. “People can become infected by norovirus every few months because of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPTWZyT25sc0ktQzBpbjJXSFhja010ejdtUVQzVFYzMXRyaUN3cDJoeHZKTTRRT2pDZXBnVE45SWxXd2NWaXl4V2wtUzR1YkhXLU9XR0ZVYjdTbm1PdnNsUXI5SF9GdkhxWGhqdEhaY2c3c0VPMUNsOUtqVlg1WW54cUpneThBOW5VcndZMEkyTEF1Z2NPb2c</guid></item><item><title>不再有凯格尔：我找到了产后失禁的解决方案–为什么没有更多的女性知道这一点？ -卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/30/peeing-after-childbirth-incontinence-sui-solution</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ome of my earliest memories feature my mother’s leotard-encased body bouncing to Jane Fonda with abandon. A similar carefree fluidity prevailed a decade later, as her feet struck hard-packed sand on a shorebreak jog. Twelve-year-old me panted alongside, so desperate to be made in her image that I tolerated heated cheeks and shaking quads. Their trembling barely subsided during the one stop we made, for her to wade into the waves and pee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="disclaimer" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.DisclaimerBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1iz7gbk"&gt;&lt;aside data-testid="affiliate-disclaimer-inline" class="dcr-189ogop"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Soon, even that wasn’t enough to staunch the flow. She gave up and switched to hiking. “I should have done more Kegels,” she quipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And that’s how I learned – before I’d even taken the SAT – about the repetitive undercarriage squeezing recommended for millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c94b0c70-dfba-4178-929a-a8031f3cdb1a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I tried everything to fix my incontinence.

For context, in 1948 the New York Obstetrical Society &lt;a href="https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2016/01/fight-women-doctors/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;refused to admit&lt;/a&gt; women, and as late as 1970 &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/health/la-me-male-gynos-20180307-htmlstory.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;only 7%&lt;/a&gt; of gynecologists were female. So it makes sense that a man created “the vaginal manometer” to record the strength of contractions of the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32310358" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pelvic floor muscles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They weaken over time as a result of things like surgery, pregnancy, vaginal delivery, smoking, and just plain &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/urinary-incontinence-during-perimenopause/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ageing while female&lt;/a&gt;. Kegel is credited with first describing how exercising these muscles can&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reduce the type of urinary incontinence that comes with a stressor, like aerobics or jogging on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If only it were as simple as that sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eventually it was my turn for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). After five pregnancies and three deliveries, coughing while walking would leave me in want of fresh panties. I told my friends I could walk without peeing and I could cough without peeing, but stood no chance against two abdominal stressors at once. “Have you done your Kegels?” they’d ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A few more years ticked by, and after a lap at the track I’d be so wet that it looked like I’d put my pants on over a damp bathing suit. “You’ve been doing Kegels though, right?” a friend texted in response to one of my pandemic-era rants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="16557f31-48fb-4941-88ad-6eebf864dc39" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt; ‘I assumed this was just the price I had to pay for procreating – and for failing to do my Kegels.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: DragonImages/Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eventually, I started paying about $90 a month to access online videos involving hip lifting and squeezing. I only did it once. By the time I turned 43, I had to wear black leggings on my Sunday morning runs so the dark outline that extended all the way to my knees wouldn’t be so stark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I never mentioned my incontinence at a doctor’s appointment, and no one asked. I assumed this was just the price I had to pay for procreating – and for failing to do my Kegels. I was the one who’d signed up for the course and not done my homework so I didn’t question the narrative of midlife incontinence being a mixture of my fault and my destiny. But what if I should have? What if a catastrophic failure of women’s health and wellness has occurred?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Spoiler alert: I should have, it has, and once I figured that out, a few quick office visits changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="no-more-suffering-in-silence" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;No more suffering in silence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The first part of my story, the silent suffering, is hardly unique. About &lt;a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/JU.0000000000004009" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;45% to 50%&lt;/a&gt; of women experience SUI at least once a week. Think of it this way: If you make 10 of us skip rope, at least four will later slink off to a bathroom to wrap toilet paper around the crotch of our undies. But not to a doctor’s office, research suggests. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21079556/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;One report&lt;/a&gt; estimates that for every case of incontinence reported to primary care doctors, 20 go unreported. Transgender men on hormone therapy also often experience SUI, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38662108/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; preliminary research. Some cis men struggle with SUI too, usually after treatment for prostate cancer, but &lt;a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/00005392-200102000-00013" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;many, many fewer&lt;/a&gt; of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For years, I just sucked it up, idiomatically and also literally, with the tissues I carried everywhere. Then one Sunday in February of 2024, something clicked. I’d run a 10K, rather than my usual 5K, on a path way out by the water, too far to make it home to change before &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2025/04/quaker-parenting-research/682277/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;. Tissues it is then. The entryway smelled like urine, but I didn’t think much of it, with all the older folks there to worship. The elevator also reeked. As I moved through more spaces, a terrible realization swept over me. I whispered in my husband’s ear: “Is that odor me?” His widened, almost guilt-ridden eyes were my answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Later that same evening, I sat in bed, showered and fresh. Until I sneezed. After a few moments of disbelief, staring down at my wet pajama shorts, I decided enough was enough. The next morning, I called University of California, San Francisco’s Women’s Center for Bladder and Pelvic &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I can’t even do one thing without peeing any more,” I told Dr Michelle Van Kuiken, less than two weeks later. Apparently, I had four main options: (1) pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), which is more than Kegels, but also, is Kegels, (2) the Poise Impressa, a tampon-like contraption you can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34505171/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;insert into your vagina&lt;/a&gt; in order to “gently lift and support the urethra”, according to its promotional materials, (3) bulking agent, sort of like lip fillers, but injected into the tissues of the urethra to make the opening smaller, and (4) the “sling”, a gold-standard surgery that creates a hammock for the urethra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I quickly ruled out PFMT, having written “do Kegels” on my to-do list for the previous seven years and not getting them to-done. The second option seemed silly, given the bedtime incident. Was I supposed to sprint to the bathroom cabinet for an Impressa when I felt a sneeze coming on? The surgery &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9753142/#:~:text=Approximately%202.4%25%20of%20women%20receiving,long%20term%20follow%2Dup%20period" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9169553/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;last me&lt;/a&gt; decades (only about 2.5% of women need a new one after 10 years and less than 20% have re-upped at 15 years), but it would require general anesthesia with its attendant risks, and I wouldn’t be able to exercise for two weeks or have sex for at least four. Exercise is my antidepressant! So is sex!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That left the fillers, what doctors call a “submucosal bulking agent”. Dr Van Kuiken’s staff made a quick call to my insurance company for approval, and told me I could receive the injection the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She warned me that it could end up taking me longer to pee and asked what would bug me more: that delay or leakage? She also offered a heads-up that it would hurt. I figured short-term pain sucks, but after childbirth, I can handle it. And you know what would suck more? Ending up like my grandma, whose bulky adult diapers made a crinkling sound when she sat, yet still weren’t effective enough for her to be comfortable in public. Not wanting that kind of isolation, I decided fillers were worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cadb01ac-6d42-47d4-a4f5-7d0f29dc5c12" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘I decided enough was enough.

Starting the same way my IUD insertions had, Dr Van Kuiken first injected lidocaine to numb my urethra and its surrounding tissues. That burned some, like a vaccine, only unfortunately placed. While we waited for it to take effect, she explained that my urethra was sort of like a deflated, doughnut-shaped pool float. By spacing four injections just right, she could plump it up without leaving a low side. Now, those injections? Those hurt quite a bit: Think bee sting plus bikini wax for at least 15 seconds each. Still, when they were done, they were done. The whole thing was no worse than a facial laser treatment like &lt;a href="https://www.dukehealth.org/blog/considering-broadband-light-therapy-heres-what-you-need-know" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;broadband light therapy&lt;/a&gt;, and I soon walked comfortably home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The next day, I went for a run with the aforementioned baby brother, who’s now 31. Nothing. Not a drop. At the tail end of a jog with one of my teenage daughters a few weeks later, I tried to sprint and felt a familiar dribble. So I went back to Dr Van Kuiken, and four weeks after the initial procedure she injected about 30% more Bulkamid. (It’s not uncommon for women to need a “top-off” injection to achieve results and durability.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I hardly realized I’d come to fear leakage, until all of a sudden I didn’t. I had no idea my gait had changed to try to minimize wetness, until my stride lengthened in the months after the procedures. The way I held my abdomen shifted, as did my times, soon matching my high school best, and then faster. I started running more – and having more fun doing it. It’s been more than a year now, and I’ve completed seven half marathons on trails up and down mountains. Without. A. Drop. And straight to church I can go, with nary a worry or a tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, a quick, safe, minimally invasive, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730435/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cost-effective&lt;/a&gt; procedure eliminated my incontinence and significantly improved my quality of life. And here’s the kicker: When Dr Van Kuiken did my physical exam, after I’d already chosen fillers, she said: “Your pelvic floor is actually really strong. No amount of Kegels was going to fix this for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6bbb0d75-0152-416e-a9dc-df2fb046fe08" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘A quick, safe, minimally invasive, and cost-effective procedure eliminated my incontinence.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Jay Boncodin/Courtesy of Gail Cornwall&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-dont-more-women-know-about-treatment-options" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why don’t more women know about treatment options?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It took me years to get good care, but more than that, years to even find out a solution existed. It doesn’t have to be this way. As one group of researchers &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33727114/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;summed it up&lt;/a&gt;: “SUI is not part of normal ageing and can be remedied.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But most women don’t know that. One study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24807341/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that less than 15% of those bothered by SUI receive an injection or surgery. Anecdotally, that statistic rings true: every last one of the people I told about my procedures said they had no idea such a thing was possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You’d think that’s because the FDA only &lt;a href="https://www.bulkamid.com/blog/fda-approves-bulkamid-in-the-united-states-and-is-now-set-for-launch-in-quarter-1-2020/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; Bulkamid in 2020, but bulking agents &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Urogynecology_and_Reconstructive_Pelvic.html?id=sKkTBQAAQBAJ" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;were first used&lt;/a&gt; in the 1930s. Innovations in the late 80s made them a more viable option, and now, they can sometimes last 96 months or more for those who are eligible. (Doctors won’t inject bulking agent if, for example, you have an active urinary tract infection.) That can mean eight years of staying dry, or much drier, while belly laughing or lifting a squirmy baby. Most women also don’t know that using synthetic mesh in sling operations starting in 1996 eliminated the need for an abdominal incision and an overnight stay. They don’t know that hormones &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/does-incontinence-get-worse-during-menopause/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can affect&lt;/a&gt; SUI. We just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;We believe Kegels are it. As it turns out, Dr Van Kuiken is a big fan of PFMT as a risk-free option. But its efficacy for SUI depends on the cause and severity of the incontinence. What’s more, that acronym encapsulates a lot of different practices, so different that &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1771840&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00404-022-06693-z&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/30/peeing-after-childbirth-incontinence-sui-solution" data-link-name="in body link" rel="sponsored"&gt;researchers don’t actually know&lt;/a&gt; how effective PFMT is. PFMT with biofeedback, for example, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825641" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has been shown to&lt;/a&gt; work better than without it. In plain English, that means Kegel-like therapies &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8910078/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8910078/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; work&lt;/a&gt; for SUI, but doctors don’t know how often or how well they &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;work, especially since the exercises can be time-consuming. In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19281321/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers asked women to do exercises for &lt;em&gt;45 minutes a day&lt;/em&gt;. I’m not the only one for whom that’s never going to happen. As one friend put it in a text: “They just told me to do kegals which I don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And shame keeps women from learning about other options. Women who do come forward are often told to lose weight or cut out alcohol or sweeteners. Sometimes they’re instructed to drink more water, sometimes less. Sometimes to avoid tea, &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/urinary-incontinence-during-perimenopause/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;but maybe&lt;/a&gt; add in decaffeinated coffee. Each of these “behavioral and lifestyle” recommendations can be read to imply that a woman is suffering because she’s been lazy or made bad decisions about what she puts in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That feels gendered. When men have a quality-of-life issue, we try to fix it. (Hello, Viagra.) When women have a problem, we tell them they wouldn’t if they’d just been a bit better and tried a bit harder, and also, to just deal. (Combine those Kegels with “&lt;a href="https://nationalincontinence.com/pages/compare_belted_undergarments" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;belted undergarments&lt;/a&gt;” and pricey &lt;a href="https://rtaesthetics.co.uk/urinary-incontinence/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;med-spa treatments&lt;/a&gt;, ladies!) I’m exaggerating somewhat, but also, there are &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1771840&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-023-01472-5&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/30/peeing-after-childbirth-incontinence-sui-solution" data-link-name="in body link" rel="sponsored"&gt;real disparities&lt;/a&gt; in funding for research on women’s health, female inclusion in clinical trials, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For me, finally receiving the right care was life-altering. After yearning to be just like my mother for so long, starting to pee myself seemed like a particularly embarrassing case of “be careful what you wish for.” But not any more. Now, I’m high and dry, even on a trampoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When my bulking injections wear off in a few years, I’ll probably ask for more. Although, maybe I’ll be like my mom, who at age 75 hops on to the treadmill unworried. She got the sling surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQUUo3b2RuZkxJZ09oa0I2WXpncFlMRElmUF9qa19QbGgyWi03YW5YSUdNdUZ6OE1keWRqcVdFb2Fkbkg3bldra1pMRXZJMWtrVEZGMGIybzc2X0JpWFpJcHdHb3VWeXFSdlN5OE0tSVVoMENKS3k4VXNnLWVMSVM2V3pPRUlsM0c2UFFTQjlCLUVaUndoX1BhQmMyOHZMMDR4UjZOYQ</guid></item><item><title>美国各地的流感活动急剧上升，至少有750万人患病： CDC - ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/US/flu-activity-rises-sharply-us-75-million-illnesses/story?id=128765018</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Flu activity is rising sharply across the United States, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC estimates there have been at least ​7.5 million illnesses, ​81,000 hospitalizations and ​3,100 deaths from flu so far this season. ​Five more pediatric deaths were reported this week, bringing the total to ​eight this season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Public health experts previously told ABC News that many of this season's cases are linked to a new flu strain called subclade K -- a variant of the H3N2 virus, which is itself a subtype of influenza A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Subclade K has been circulating since the summer in other countries and was a main driver of a spike in flu cases in Canada, Japan and the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Of the 1,600 flu samples tested by the CDC, roughly ​92% were H3N2.

                &lt;p&gt;2025 has proven to be a nightmare year for measles, with the U.S. reaching a toll not seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the latest data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been more than 2,000 recorded cases of measles this year. Most of these infections are occurring among the unvaccinated and  children. Several outbreaks are still ongoing, and the U.S. is likely to lose its official measles-free status as early as next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A record-setting year&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 23, there have been 2,012 confirmed measles cases in the U.S., the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tally is the highest seen since measles was locally eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, surpassing the previous modern high of 1,274 cases in 2019; it’s also the most since 1992, which saw over 2,000 cases. However, experts have said that these current numbers are almost certainly an underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The largest outbreak began in early January along parts of Western Texas. But measles has spread far and wide across the U.S. this year, with cases seen in 43 states, along with 50 separate outbreaks. About two-thirds of reported cases have occurred among children under the age of 18, and 93% involved people who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Three people in the U.S. have died from measles this year, while 227 have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The official return of measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the Texas outbreak formally ended in August, there is concern that some current outbreaks are genetically linked to it. If that’s true, then we will soon pass the one-year mark of measles circulating locally in the country. And once that happens, the World Health Organization is expected to declare that measles has officially returned to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The U.S. would hardly be alone in welcoming measles back. In November, Canada &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;similarly lost&lt;/a&gt; its measles elimination status. The viral disease has &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/european-region-reports-highest-number-measles-cases-more-25-years-unicef-whoeurope" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;also resurged&lt;/a&gt; in many parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The return of measles has been fueled by waning vaccination rates. It’s a problem that precedes the installment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,—a long time enemy of vaccines—as head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But Kennedy hasn’t &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-worst-ways-rfk-jr-has-harmed-public-health-this-year-2000698509" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;helped&lt;/a&gt; the situation, either.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, for instance, RFK Jr. and his allies have restricted people’s access to certain vaccines. He’s also reduced the workforce of the CDC and other health agencies, as well as personally fired senior officials who refused to back his anti-vaccine policies. And during the Texas measles outbreak, he recommended unsupported treatments like cod liver oil that may have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vitamin-a-fix-for-measles-is-hurting-kids-in-texas-2000585347" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;further endangered&lt;/a&gt; some children. Next year, he may even succeed at &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-tried-to-wreck-the-childhood-vaccine-schedule-over-the-weekend-2000702477" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;dramatically shortening&lt;/a&gt; the childhood vaccination schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one positive silver lining is that the overall vaccination rate for measles (above 90%) is still high in the U.S., at least for now. But it has been declining lately and it’s not high enough to ensure herd immunity for people unable to get vaccinated, such as very young children (the first measles shot, of three, isn’t typically given until age one). So while most Americans will remain protected against measles, it could continue to cause widespread outbreaks in vulnerable regions for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2025 has been a bad year for measles, but the worst may yet be to come.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

From inventing endless super-soups that might banish the mid-afternoon snack attack, to wildly optimistic lunchtime to-do lists, I have tried and failed countless times. The executive coach &lt;a href="https://www.zoethompson.uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Zoe Thomson&lt;/a&gt; is not surprised. “One of the biggest things for people is they overestimate how much time and energy they are going to have in their lunch hour,” says Thomson, who previously had a 20-year career with the Avon and Somerset police. “And they underestimate how much time and energy they might need to achieve it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I tell her that this has been the flaw with most of my doomed lunchtime masterplans. “The problem is, unpredictable things happen. Say you plan to do a 45-minute spin class in a 60-minute lunch break, but your last call overruns by 10 minutes. Your plan is no longer feasible. If you decided instead to do a 10-minute walk around the block every day, and then have a nice cup of tea after your sandwich, you’re winning. Even if something urgent comes up, the 10-minute walk is still possible. And on a really good day you could walk four times around the block.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I confess that I find this idea a bit uninspiring. How am I going to transform my lung capacity by ambling to the end of the road? “Actually, when you look at the most successful people, they do the boring, small, incremental changes daily and stick with it,” says Thomson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3db36540-0d4e-4fe1-a74a-c1faf749c53f" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Try to fit in a 10-minute walk every day.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by models; JohnnyGreig/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But even if you’re ensconced in a healthy routine, there can still be space to mix it up. “As humans, we like certainty, but we crave variety,” she says. And after a morning of work, she points out, many of us struggle with decision fatigue. “So if we aim for 80% routine and 20% variety, that’s probably about right. Having to make a fresh decision about what to do for lunch every day creates stress,” says Thomson. Having occasional lunch breaks with a shared activity can be great – a book group works well, as does an uplifting choir session such as those organised by &lt;a href="https://www.musicinoffices.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Music in Offices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://selinabarker.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Selina Barker&lt;/a&gt; is a coach and creator of &lt;a href="https://projectyoujournals.com/time-to-thrive-journal" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Time to Thrive&lt;/a&gt;, a journal that focuses on energy management rather than time. “However long your lunch break lasts, even if it’s only 10 minutes, the key point is that it’s there to top your energy back up. The prescription for how you do this will vary depending on the type of work you do. So if you’ve been in meetings all morning with people talking at you, maybe what you need is a quiet walk in the park – especially for introverts working in an open-plan office. But if you’ve been on your feet for hours, maybe the best thing would be a yoga or meditation class.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you work in an office, it can sometimes feel a bit awkward to step away from the canteen crowd and go off on your own. Barker says we shouldn’t feel embarrassed about prioritising what we actually need. “Don’t make a big thing of it. Just say I’m off to recharge my batteries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When it comes to the main event – the food – choosing what to eat can be tricky. Ideally, we want something that is enticing, yet still healthy and will sustain our energy until home time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="da6f0c49-2948-4fdb-bbbe-2c54fd46571f" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Add wholegrains to ensure your salad is filling enough.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: d3sign/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The lunches that work against you are usually the highly refined ones,” says the nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.rosemarynutrition.co.uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Rosemary Martin&lt;/a&gt;. “A pastry or white-bread sandwich with crisps or a chocolate bar on the side gives you a quick boost followed by a predictable drop in energy and concentration.” But not all lunches labelled healthy are good either. “The tiny low-carb salad may feel virtuous at midday but leaves you tired, distracted and craving sugar a couple of hours later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:6060,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;how-to-have-a-better-day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Sign up to our 16-part series and get expert advice on how to improve your life - from morning to night&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;How to have a better day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Twice weekly, for eight weeks&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;You're signed up to How to have a better day.&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;features&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Martin suggests that if you want steady energy and clear focus after lunch, the magic ingredient is balance. “Go for meals that combine whole grains, plant protein, healthy fats and colourful vegetables that will digest at a comfortable pace and give your brain what it needs to stay focused into the afternoon. Lentil soup with wholegrain bread, a tofu, rice and veg bowl or a hummus wrap with plenty of crunchy salad are simple but nourishing options which will reliably carry you through the rest of your day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For those who work at home, all of this becomes a lot easier. You can exercise at home and prepare lunch far from the horrors of the office microwave. But experts point out that there are still important issues to be mindful of. A common strategy is skipping the lunch break altogether in order to finish early. “I do often question it when people tell me they’re saving that hour for the end of the day. I think that takes away from what the lunch break is actually for,” says Thomson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, she agrees that for some people, taking an entire hour might not make sense. “You could split the hour into three 20-minute breaks spread across the afternoon or two half-hour ones,” she says, but the principles remain the same. Are you stepping away from your desk? “Are you taking time to get up and move (or sit down and rest if you’re on your feet all day?) Are you giving yourself some downtime? If you don’t create that space to slow down the brain, it will wake you up at three or four in the morning.” It’s much better, she says, “to give yourself headspace by design.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNdDU2Tm0yVkJ3OGN6UWRsZE9mZmFBWXVNbk43S0NCQ3ZoSERoOWltUWdFTDBzZXVqV1VPVF8wWHl1dk1KOGpIYTJNYkpFaGpCbjI2bDNrczE5THNBOXdYWjcyUnF6R0tJMTVCYVdyY011dzhRYXQ2R1BTTFZ4WUN4bHJKV0dQMmcyd1VoeklaS2tVbENidktUV1QzN19KZWV6a1Bn</guid></item><item><title>流感在纽约肆虐。如果您生病了，该怎么办。- Gothamist</title><link>https://gothamist.com/news/the-flu-is-surging-in-nyc-heres-what-to-do-if-youre-sickened</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="nxm5b"&gt;Getting sick is never fun, but navigating the flu in crowded New York City can be especially challenging, with limited space to isolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7hggd"&gt;Yet there is an upside to getting sick in the five boroughs, where there's an abundance of doctors and pharmacies, and restaurants that will deliver soup to your very stoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="afnvj"&gt;New York is experiencing a &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/new-york-state-has-set-a-record-for-flu-cases-ahead-of-peak-season" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;historic flu outbreak&lt;/a&gt; this season, with more than 70,000 new cases recorded statewide the week before Christmas.

You can test yourself at home with a kit that checks for COVID-19 and a couple of common strains of the flu. Several brands are available &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=at+home+test+for+flu&amp;amp;adgrpid=187087338955&amp;amp;hvadid=779676103334&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvexpln=0&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9073501&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvocijid=14144849016412603386--&amp;amp;hvqmt=e&amp;amp;hvrand=14144849016412603386&amp;amp;hvtargid=kwd-766565153038&amp;amp;hydadcr=25166_13800698_2252910&amp;amp;mcid=84349fa05442364e9b88e35b8d806e04&amp;amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;amp;ref=pd_sl_78if1xzrws_e" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/ihealth-covid-19-flu-a-b-3-in-1-home-rapid-test-kit-2-ct-prodid-564379" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;over the counter&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.walgreens.com/search/results.jsp?Ntt=at%20home%20flu%20test&amp;amp;analyticsTag=global" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;different pharmacies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5o8vo"&gt;You can also get tested at a local urgent care clinic.

If you don’t regularly see a doctor, you can check with your insurer or a website like Zocdoc for a list of providers who are covered under your plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1nrgs"&gt;Dr. Andrew Wallach, ambulatory care chief medical officer at NYC Health + Hospitals, recommended that you get tested for the flu as soon as possible after you start to feel sick. He said antiviral medications like Tamiflu, which treat the flu, are most effective if taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8svih"&gt;People who are not yet sick but face increased risk of serious illness, like the elderly, can also sometimes qualify for prophylaxis medications that help to prevent sickness, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7840k"&gt;Wallach also said any New Yorker who feels sick can reach out to &lt;a href="https://expresscare.nyc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Health + Hospitals’ virtual ExpressCare&lt;/a&gt;, which offers telehealth consultations in more than 200 languages 24 hours a day, seven days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="5jgmu"&gt;&lt;b&gt;To quarantine or not to quarantine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ed5gb"&gt;When you have the flu, isolating from others is the most reliable way to avoid getting anyone else sick. But in New York City, that’s not always an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1lnv7"&gt;If you live with others, Wallach said, wearing a mask in common spaces can help to prevent the spread of illness. He also recommended regular hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of three to six feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7uhrb"&gt;If you’re a parent and your child gets sick, masking and wearing gloves or regularly washing your hands can reduce your chances of catching the flu, said Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2fs90"&gt;“ Not everyone wants to do that around their kid. But it does work,” she said. “I see kids with the flu all the time, and I wear a mask and gloves in my office, and so far I haven't caught the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4i0qg"&gt;If your sick child can recover in a separate bedroom, Kravitz said, that’s ideal. But if they need to share a space with siblings who aren’t sick, she said, those who are old enough to mask can do so. She said parents should also regularly wipe down surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="eaupn"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fueling yourself — or your loved one — to feel better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fc76s"&gt;Wallach and Kravitz both said hydration is a key component to recovery. Kravitz recommended lots of water, but also other fluids that contain electrolytes, like Pedialyte popsicles for younger kids and Gatorade for older children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d8gbf"&gt;“ I usually tell parents, just get something into them. Even if that means giving them a little bit of juice, that's not the end of the world,” she said, adding: “ Anything that they want to drink to make sure that they're hydrating themselves is good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f38b7"&gt;When asked whether soup is actually an effective medicine, Wallach confirmed the myth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8brg7"&gt;“ It is somewhat of an old wives’ tale,” he said. “However, it is rooted in science — and that is, if you eat soup, it's going to help maintain your hydration status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4e1vq"&gt;Many New York City restaurants are available for soup delivery, whether you’re in the mood for ramen, pho, matzoh ball soup or ajiaco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="a88ke"&gt;&lt;b&gt;When it may be time for more serious treatment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="95i32"&gt;Kravitz said she recommends that parents bring their child to the doctor if they continue to have a fever for more than four or five days, because they may also be sick with something other than the flu, like strep throat. The flu and COVID are just two of many illnesses circulating in New York this winter, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/respiratory-illness-data/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;city health data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ei7eh"&gt;Kravitz said parents should consider seeking treatment for their kids at the hospital if they are struggling to breathe, have a high fever that leads to disorientation or are so dehydrated that they are not urinating on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2iuam"&gt;For adults, it might be necessary to go to the hospital if you can’t keep fluids down or your fever persists even with fever-reducing medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, Wallach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="1pu3r"&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you’re not sick yet, it’s not too late to get the flu shot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="44u2a"&gt;If you haven’t gotten the flu yet and you haven’t been vaccinated, both doctors recommend getting the shot now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="evgjn"&gt;“ It takes about two weeks for you to get full impact and protection from the vaccine,” Wallach said. “We have not yet peaked here in New York City, so you can still protect yourself by getting a flu shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="30nrb"&gt;The city health department has a &lt;a href="https://a816-health.nyc.gov/NYCHealthMap/ServiceCategory/Vaccines" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine map&lt;/a&gt; where you can find sites offering the flu shot. Many pharmacies, urgent care clinics, doctors’ offices and hospitals offer the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPRllRVjdHNEQySDd4cjV4WmZhaWtaRkpXWnhQbFppUzdfRi04Y0VLZVlEeTlKT0ZMVllLYXBuVV9QZnB1dlN0djc1UHV1Q1A3bk5UNHVvQ0daS3BIQW5UcTZDb3RNV0ladDV6TTN3a3pNazJMWWRSVjY1YVp5UFpFUVh0YzhOZFZVMWFubXUweXY</guid></item><item><title>一位营养师连续一周每天都吃鸡蛋-这是她感到惊讶的地方- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/dietitian-ate-eggs-every-day-143200202.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;I Ate Eggs Every Day for a Week&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, I’ve watched with professional excitement as the nutritional tide has turned for eggs. For years, yolks were vilified, but new evidence has brought them back into favor, with the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/08/15/are-eggs-good-for-you-or-not" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; now suggesting that healthy individuals can include up to one whole egg per day as part of a heart-healthy diet. So when my editor asked me to eat one egg every day for a week and report back any key findings, I was happy to take on the challenge. My goal was to explore the experience firsthand and see how it felt to intentionally add this nutritional powerhouse to my daily routine every single day for seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep things simple, I started the week by hard-boiling a batch of eggs and keeping them shelled in the fridge for a quick grab-and-go snack. One morning, I opted for scrambled eggs instead. Another day, I added an egg to a bowl of ramen, letting it poach gently in the hot broth. I tried to incorporate eggs in ways that fit naturally into my meals, whether as the star of breakfast or as an addition to lunch or dinner—keeping it as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I ate an egg every day for a week?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heading into this week, I was curious to see if I would notice any changes. After reflecting on my experience, the most significant takeaway was that my energy levels stayed steady throughout the day, and I felt fewer hunger pangs. I attribute this to the high-quality protein found in eggs. I didn’t encounter any digestive issues—or really any issues at all! It was business as usual during my week-long egg-eating experiment, just with the added benefits of more consistent energy and reduced hunger, which I consider a win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment also made me more mindful of hidden ingredients. Since I aimed to stick to the “one egg per day” rule, I found myself double-checking whether foods like pancakes or baked goods already contained eggs. It was a good reminder of how often eggs sneak into our diets without us realizing it. That said, I suspect I unintentionally exceeded my "one egg a day" limit due to these hidden sources. Because of this, I’ll likely ease up on eggs in the week following the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising benefits was a noticeable reduction in daily stress. To be clear, it’s not as though eating an egg instantly melted away my anxiety. Rather, having a high-quality protein source readily available in the fridge simplified mealtime decisions. There was no need to thaw frozen chicken or beef or plan ahead to marinate anything. This convenience cut down on prep time and mental effort. Adding a quick protein to a salad or soup became an easy, automatic choice, which helped reduce decision fatigue. It highlighted how much of a difference simple, accessible ingredients can make in streamlining the daily routine of meal preparation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Health benefits of eggs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond my personal experience, eggs offer a wealth of scientifically backed health benefits. They are a true nutritional powerhouse, packed into a small, affordable package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;High-quality protein&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the high-quality protein and nutrients in eggs that, along with a balanced diet and regular exercise, help to support all 600+ muscles in your body and overall health. Eggs are a complete protein source, providing all of the amino acids the body can’t make on its own. Plus, egg protein has been said to be highly digestible, with the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9316657/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:highest attainable protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;highest attainable protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score&lt;/a&gt; (PDCAAS). The PDCAAS score is so high that food scientists often use eggs as a standard to assess the protein quality of other foods. So, whatever your protein goals are, reaching for that carton of eggs is one of your best bets to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Brain health support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are rich in choline, which is a nutrient that's crucial for brain health and is just one reason eggs are a smart choice! In fact, eggs are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12538690/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:among the highest sources of choline in the American diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;among the highest sources of choline in the American diet&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrient that supports brain health at every stage of life. Choline is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6259877/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:crucial nutrient;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;crucial nutrient &lt;/a&gt;for supporting brain development, memory, and mood, and one that 90% of Americans don't get enough of. With 150 milligrams of choline per egg, that’s about &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:27% of the daily requirement for men and 35% for women per egg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;27% of the daily requirement for men and 35% for women per egg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the benefits don’t stop there! Eggs are also a source of many other&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667009725000284" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health-supporting nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; brain health-supporting nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, like vitamin B12, iodine, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34063827/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lutein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lutein&lt;/a&gt;, and high-quality protein, nutrients that may support brain health and cognitive function. And here’s the golden rule: don’t skip the yolk! Nearly half of an egg’s protein and most of its vitamins and minerals (including choline, lutein, and B12) &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6470839/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:are found in the yolk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;are found in the yolk&lt;/a&gt;. Adding eggs to your meal rotation isn’t just a smart move; it’s a no-brainer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eye health support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lutein found in the yolk supports brain health, as mentioned above. But it is also an antioxidant that plays a crucial role in eye health. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8874683/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lutein, along with another compound called zeaxanthin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lutein, along with another compound called zeaxanthin&lt;/a&gt;, both found in egg yolks, accumulate in the retina and may help protect the eyes from harmful blue light and reduce the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/eye-health-information/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:age-related macular degeneration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;age-related macular degeneration&lt;/a&gt; (AMD), a condition that can lead to vision challenges as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Immune system support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strong immune system relies on a steady supply of key vitamins and minerals, and eggs can help you meet those needs. They are a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33308613/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:source of many immune health-supporting nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;source of many immune health-supporting nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, including selenium and zinc, two minerals essential for immune function. Eggs are also one of the few natural food sources of vitamin D, a critical nutrient that plays a role in regulating immune responses. A single egg provides about 6% of the daily value for vitamin D, contributing to your body’s overall defense system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Egg nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a breakdown of the approximate nutritional value of one large (50g) egg, according to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/748967/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:United States Department of Agriculture (USDA);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 72&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 6.3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total Fat: 4.8 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturated Fat: 1.6 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol: 186 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodium: 71 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D: 44 IU (6% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A: 270 IU (5% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riboflavin (B2): 0.2 mg (15% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12: 0.4 mcg (17% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selenium: 15.4 mcg (28% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline: 147 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all—eggs are also a powerhouse of antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which support eye health!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should avoid eggs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While eggs are a healthy choice for most people, they aren’t suitable for everyone. Individuals with an egg allergy, which is one of the more common food allergies in children, should avoid them completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, people with high cholesterol or a risk of heart disease were advised to limit eggs due to the dietary cholesterol in the yolk. However, current research suggests that for generally healthy people, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2023/08/25/heres-the-latest-on-dietary-cholesterol-and-how-it-fits-in-with-a-healthy-diet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dietary cholesterol has a minimal impact on blood cholesterol levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dietary cholesterol has a minimal impact on blood cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;. The American Heart Association notes that healthy individuals can include up to one whole egg per day in a heart-healthy dietary pattern. Those with existing heart conditions should consult their doctor or a dietitian for personalized advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating an egg a day into my routine turned out to be a simple yet impactful experiment. Not only did it highlight the versatility and convenience of this nutrient-packed food, but it also reinforced how small, intentional changes can make a big difference in daily life. From steady energy levels to reduced decision fatigue, eggs proved to be more than just a breakfast staple—they became a reliable ally in my busy schedule. Plus, knowing I was fueling my body with high-quality protein and essential nutrients like choline and lutein made the experience all the more rewarding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE4tSGV3anZaSUg2VDA2R183c21xcmczREk1OGhLYmVoWl9SOXZrODJuTEcybWJTaGVxZjhoSk1GWXltMmxOeFRBUmRack1WaWRkRzdQUUpUQ1NvU1d1TktzZ3M3TFEzQkp3R0kwclFqeXFGRGpOYXFodFlNX1U</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，您可能没有得到足够的令人惊讶的营养- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/surprising-nutrient-probably-not-getting-130000259.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;How Choline Can Benefit Your Heart and Memory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;SimpleImages - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably read a lot about how your body needs &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a68067521/signs-not-getting-enough-protein/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a66031042/signs-you-need-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, but one important nutrient that many people don’t know about—and aren’t getting enough of—is choline. The &lt;strong&gt;benefits of choline&lt;/strong&gt; are wide-ranging: “It affects muscle contraction, heart function, pain signaling, mood, memory, and overall cognitive performance,” explains &lt;a href="https://nicolettepace.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nicolette M. Pace;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nicolette M.

Lauren Manaker, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutrition Now says choline is “surprisingly overlooked,” noting that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6259877/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:approximately 90% of Americans aren’t getting enough of it;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;approximately 90% of Americans aren’t getting enough of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about the benefits of choline and how to increase the amount you’re getting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is choline?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Choline is an essential nutrient that your body needs to function properly,” Manaker explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a water-soluble compound that is often grouped with B-complex vitamins because of their similarities, though it is not technically a vitamin or a mineral,” she says. “Think of it as a fundamental building block for your overall health.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of choline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s research indicating that choline benefits your cardiovascular health, your brain health, and potentially, your liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease (particularly a stroke).&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients &lt;/em&gt;in 2023, a higher dietary choline intake was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10534328/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:associated with a lower cardiovascular disease risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;associated with a lower cardiovascular disease risk&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers noted that people who consumed more dietary choline were less likely to have a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It can improve cognitive function in older adults&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12482226/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research published in 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research published in 2025&lt;/a&gt; found that moderate to high dietary intakes of choline may be associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment in adults aged 60 and older. Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10025538/#s12" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientific review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;scientific review&lt;/a&gt; found that choline supplements were associated with improved cognitive performance and blood vessel health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It may help manage nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25320186/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed that the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was lower in both women and men of normal weight who had high levels of choline intake. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40838115/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Another study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2025 found that choline supplementation in NAFLD patients had a favorable impact on oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and lipid profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much choline do you need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaker explains that your liver can make small amounts of this nutrient, but not enough to meet your daily needs, meaning you need to get choline from your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-Consumer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, the average daily recommended amounts of choline varies based on age and sex. Here’s how much adults generally need: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women 19 and older: 425 milligrams per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men 19 and older: 550 milligrams per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women: 425 milligrams per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breastfeeding women 550 milligrams per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are good sources of choline?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eggs are the most common dietary source, with the choline found exclusively in the yolk—two whole eggs provide more than half the daily requirement,” says Pace. “Other sources include meats, fish such as salmon and cod, and dairy products like milk and yogurt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manaker also mentions plant-based options like soybeans, potatoes, and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how much choline is in each of these foods, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One large hard-boiled egg: 147 milligrams (About 35% of the daily value for an adult woman)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beef liver (3 oz): 356 milligrams (83% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braised beef top (3 oz): 117 milligrams (28% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roasted chicken breast (3 oz): 72 milligrams (17% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooked Atlantic cod (3 oz): 71 milligrams (17% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooked quinoa (1 cup): 43 milligrams (10% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1% fat milk (1 cup): 43 milligrams (10% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boiled Brussels sprouts (1/2 cup): 32 milligrams (8% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boiled broccoli (1/2 cup): 31 milligrams (7% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooked shiitake mushrooms (1/2 cup): 27 milligrams (6% DV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you take a choline supplement?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a dietitian, I usually recommend a ‘food first’ approach,” says Manaker. “Most people can meet their needs through a varied diet. However, there are specific groups who might need a supplement. Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals have higher choline needs to support the baby’s brain development. Strict vegetarians or vegans might also struggle to get enough since the richest sources are animal-based. People with certain genetic variations may also require more choline.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:08:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNR3ZlTnFJdUlLOTRidEtrRmxqeG5PakhiRUVJb1g2c1c2SE1WWFpIZjJlN05oV1hEY2tORWRUR28tVGdSOGV3TVV0TVlCOG9DTlNvYldTS0U1TTluWnJKUUxQd0lYUldDMlFXanFHUXItV3l0TXp5cDk3OC1EQ1lQRGxQOWZrSV94ZHc3aA</guid></item><item><title>2025年五大最可怕和最引人入胜的医疗案例- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/12/the-top-5-most-horrifying-and-fascinating-medical-cases-of-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Humans accidentally get infected by eating raw vegetables containing or contaminated by infected slugs or snails, or by eating undercooked creatures that eat slugs or snails, such as land crabs, freshwater prawns, or frogs. In the woman’s case, doctors suspected she got infected from eating raw seafood and salads on a recent trip to Hawaii, where the parasite is a known threat. Luckily, the woman was treated for the infection and made a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s not every day a person gets drunk and wakes up with a medical case so enigmatic that a master clinician with an expertise in medical reasoning is called in to help crack it. But a 36-year-old did just that in a case published this year in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man showed up at the hospital with abdominal pain, a crackling in his lungs, bacteria in his blood, liver abnormalities, an injury in his small intestine, and a blood clot in his right kidney—and no clear idea of how any of those things happened or how they were connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case report, doctors lay out how they identified all of the aspects of his condition and then how master clinician Gurpreet Dhaliwal of the University of California, San Francisco, unraveled how they fit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing a fascinating look into diagnostic sleuthing, Dhaliwal reasoned out that it all came down to beers and a toothpick. The man—who had a history of binge drinking—got drunk, ate something, and accidentally swallowed a toothpick, Dhaliwal surmised. While still drunk, the man aspirated some of the food, causing his lung infection. The toothpick, meanwhile, pierced his small intestine near his right kidney, causing the injury and the blood clot. The injury then became infected, causing sepsis and his liver abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;Can you pass this 4-move strength check at 60? Try it and see how you stack up.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Let’s be real: Aging has a reputation problem. It’s a misconception that, after 60, your strength, balance, and physical abilities inevitably decline. But that’s not necessarily the case, and we’re here to tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While muscle mass, bone density, and strength can decline with age (a condition called &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age" target="_blank"&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10235889/" target="_blank"&gt;rate of decline is significantly influenced&lt;/a&gt; by the way you move, how often you train, and whether your workouts challenge the right muscles and movement patterns that matter most for daily life. In fact, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2025.1500915/full" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows even moderate physical activity can reduce your sarcopenia risk by 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the strongest predictors of longevity and independence in older adults have nothing to do with how much weight you can lift in a gym. Instead, they come down to whether you can perform a handful of fundamental movements, such as standing up from a chair, pushing your body off the ground, climbing stairs, and stabilizing your trunk. These are more “life skills” than traditional gym exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out which four essential moves reveal your body’s overall strength at 60, we spoke with &lt;b&gt;James Brady&lt;/b&gt;, personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.origym.co.uk/blog/author/jbrady/" target="_blank"&gt;OriGym&lt;/a&gt;, who tells us, “Together, these four movements challenge strength, stability, and cardiovascular effort in a way that translates directly to real life. If you can train these exercises consistently at 60, your body is not just keeping up with your age, it is outperforming it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This classic lower-body movement closely mirrors one of the most common daily tasks: standing up from a seated position. That seemingly simple action relies on coordinated strength from your legs, glutes, and core, along with joint mobility. “Squats are one of the most effective full body exercises for burning calories and maintaining independence as you age,” says Brady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart and toes slightly turned out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex your core and keep your chest upright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push your hips back and bend your knees to lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower as far as you can while maintaining control and upright posture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive through your heels to return to standing without locking your knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform three sets of 10 to 12 reps, resting for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="push-ups" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Push-ups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Push-ups are an excellent indicator of upper-body and core strength because they require you to control your entire body as one unit, which becomes increasingly important as coordination and muscle mass deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Push-ups can be done on the floor, on knees, or elevated on a bench or wall,” explains Brady. “When done correctly, they can help build upper body strength through the chest, shoulders, arms, and core, all of which tend to decline with age if not trained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart on the floor, bench, or wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your legs or position your knees depending on the chosen variation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core and glutes to keep your body in a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward your hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your palms to return to the starting position with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim for three sets of 8 to 12 reps. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="step-ups" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step-ups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfhXnLILqdk?si=OJAptbSXxEZX3WOd" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step-ups are a true test of your lower-body strength, balance, and coordination. That’s because they mimic climbing stairs, a daily task that becomes increasingly challenging for many adults as they age, often due to weakness rather than joint issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Step ups improve leg strength, balance, and coordination, which are all crucial for staying active and injury free in later life,” Brady says. “They also work large muscle groups and elevate your heart rate quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand facing a sturdy step or platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place one foot fully on the step, keeping your weight centered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through the heel of your front foot to lift your body upward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the trailing foot onto the step without pushing off excessively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step back down with control and repeat before switching legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform three sets of 10 reps per leg, resting 45 to 60 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="plank" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvIjsG5Svck?si=ofktrdk75J7enCnJ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the plank may look static, it’s one of the most effective ways to evaluate your core endurance and stability. Brady explains that “Planks strengthen the deep core muscles that support posture, protect the spine, and make all other movements more efficient. A stronger core also helps you train harder overall, which indirectly supports fat loss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your forearms on the floor with your elbows under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your legs behind you while balancing on your toes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core and glutes to keep your body in a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid sagging through the hips or lifting them too high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the position while breathing steadily and maintaining alignment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold for 20 to 40 seconds for three sets. Rest for 45 to 60 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

While finding biomarkers for healthy aging is useful, interpreting those results is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this stage, there is no single blood test that can reliably predict how long a person might live based on what's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-of-more-than-1-million-people-finds-intriguing-link-between-iron-levels-and-lifespan"&gt;flowing through their veins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177313" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177313" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-642x260.jpg" alt="Old Woman Young Photo" class="size-medium wp-image-177313" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177313" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Dimitri Otis/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle, genetics, and sheer randomness can change the future course of a person's life in unpredictable ways. But maybe the blood of superagers can help us identify &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/looking-deep-into-your-eyes-could-reveal-whether-you-re-a-fast-ager"&gt;'fast' agers&lt;/a&gt;, who are at risk of early mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2024, a study analyzing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114913"&gt;hundreds of metabolites&lt;/a&gt; in blood samples from around 5,000 individuals, aged between 18 and 110, found a unique signature associated with extreme longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114913"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt;, reveal a "critical role of essential fatty acids to connect lipids with other metabolic processes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-is-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;A Common Diabetes Drug Is Linked to 'Exceptional Longevity' in Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the metabolites involved in aging were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-can-add-10-years-to-your-life-simply-by-changing-your-diet-massive-study-finds"&gt;linked to nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that diet could be a source of intervention for growing older in a healthier way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branyas herself ate a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/12-year-study-reveals-how-the-mediterranean-diet-might-affect-your-brain"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; high in yogurt, which researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dna-study-of-117-year-old-woman-reveals-clues-to-a-long-life"&gt;suspect&lt;/a&gt; may have played a role in her lengthy life: Her &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gut-bacteria-might-actually-reveal-how-old-you-are"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; was remarkably youthful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-your-genes-determine-how-long-you-ll-live"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt; seems to play a strong role in how long they live, but genes are not fate, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-grandparents-diet-could-still-be-affecting-you-and-your-kids-health"&gt;environment and lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; can also impact the length of a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists remain hopeful that research on centenarians and supercentenarians will one day translate into drug or lifestyle interventions that benefit us all.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrh81ji00003b6sszm8d3gh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the second year in a row, the US has surpassed 25,000 whooping cough cases — another sign of the risks of falling vaccination levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrhkx10000f3b6snqjym64e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often called the “100-day cough,” whooping cough or pertussis begins with cold-like symptoms such as runny nose, fever or cough that can progress to coughing fits that last weeks or months, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; A “whoop” sound when coughing may appear in the second phase of illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrjs424000u3b6scm85j5ri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The infection can lead to severe illness or death, especially in young children: About 1 in 3 babies younger than 1 who have whooping cough requires &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;care in a hospital&lt;/a&gt;. Still, experts believe that much of the disease goes unrecognized and unreported, the CDC says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00033b6nwbgwl0xp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC reported nearly 28,000 cases this year, an elevated level after a peak last year, when the agency reported 35,493 cases. One year earlier, in 2023, there were only 7,063 cases reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrhss78000i3b6svqy7jcc9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;The last time&lt;/a&gt; numbers were similarly high was 2014, when there were 32,971 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrhbeng00043b6svyc8j44o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thirteen deaths from pertussis have been reported in the US this year, according to the Pan American Health Organization, most of them children under 1 year old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyzhjid00023b6qvst3qogq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rise in whooping cough is not unique to the US, according to the Pan American Health Organization, which serves as the World Health Organization’s office for the Americas region. Last year, 977,000 cases of pertussis were reported to WHO, a five-fold increase over 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00043b6nljyrmeom@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine, believes the US rise is driven by falling vaccination rates along with a loss of population-wide immunity during the Covid-19 pandemic, among other factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00053b6ntrk78x4r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I worry vaccine hesitancy is playing a role. This is a vaccine-preventable illness, and any decline in vaccine rates will lead to increases in pertussis,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitl3alp00033b6qltcks1gu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; routine diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccination for all infants and children under 7 through a five-dose series beginning at 2 months of age. Children who get all five doses of the DTaP vaccine on schedule are 98% protected from illness within the year after the last dose. About 70% of children are fully protected five years after getting the last dose, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/types.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00063b6ni0fundth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adults and adolescents are urged to get a booster Td or Tdap vaccination every 10 years, starting at the age of 11 or 12, to maintain protection. Roberts recommends choosing the version that protects against pertussis — Tdap — when possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00073b6n2zcuefse@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Last year, we had a lot of college outbreaks. What happens is, a lot of people get their childhood vaccine series, and then they don’t get the booster series,” Roberts said. He noted that many of those outbreaks were driven by students who had lost their immunity and were living in group settings where the disease spreads easily.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfqm6e00083b6npxcr43oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A return to shared indoor spaces after the pandemic may have also contributed to the increase, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitl5hq000053b6qyui3mm2f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There had been limited exposure to routine pathogens because of Covid-19 mitigation measures, he said, but now “a greater proportion of people are getting exposed to the pathogen, all at the same time. I wonder if there is some degree of loss of population immunity that we’re still recovering from, and maybe things will [stabilize] over the next few years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyue6o900023b6n9i0424rt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the PAHO &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-12/8-dec-2025pheepiupdate-pertussisenfinal0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;epidemiological update&lt;/a&gt; highlights that vaccination coverage in the Americas region for the first and third doses of Tdap dropped to its lowest level in two decades during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, coverage rates were at 87% for the first dose and 81% for the third dose of the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrhvwh8000p3b6s6xyc9rev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roberts emphasizes the importance of pertussis vaccines for children and pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrk124v00153b6sz82gw2pl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/tdap-vaccination-during-pregnancy.html" target="_blank"&gt;The CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends a Tdap booster between weeks 27 and 36 of pregnancy, regardless of prior vaccination timing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrk0vby00123b6sun44pkay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a pregnant woman gets the vaccine, “the mom is going to develop antibodies [against pertussis],” Roberts said. These antibodies “spread through the placenta and get to the baby. When the baby’s born, they’ll have some immunity from that placenta.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrk18hb00183b6sqbui1r1r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, maternal antibodies “wane over a couple of months,” Roberts said, underscoring the need for children to complete the DTaP &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmitfqp3r000b3b6nvv5wl2ui@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="whooping-cough-symptoms-and-treatment" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Whooping cough symptoms and treatment
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfpad500003b6n4u5qwt5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whooping cough differs from flu, Covid-19 and the common cold in that it is caused by a bacterium rather than a virus, although early symptoms can look nearly identical, said Dr. Shira Doron, chief infection control officer for Tufts Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfra4k000h3b6nyqo8dkg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even though it can look like a viral respiratory infection, it’s actually a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis, and it’s got some very characteristic features,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfra4k000k3b6n1llnma0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A week or two into the illness, some people may have a characteristic &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB70izafC1Y" target="_blank"&gt;whoop&lt;/a&gt; when trying to catch their breath between heavy fits of coughing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfra4k000l3b6ngbpxi35q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If coughing becomes severe, Doron said, patients may have what’s called post-tussive emesis: “vomiting when you cough or after you cough, and then the whooping sounds that also follow a coughing spell.” She advises people to see a doctor if they have severe worsening cough with symptoms such as vomiting or the whooping sound.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitl91ho00093b6q5lfvi5yo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These severe symptoms result from airway damage caused by the bacterial toxin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfra4k000n3b6nxxqea09y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Antibiotics are the main treatment for whooping cough. When started early in the illness, Doron explained, medications can “break the chain of transmission” and lessen contagiousness, but they “do not change the course of the illness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfra4k000o3b6nnocjk4lk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because pertussis rapid tests&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;can be hard to find in clinics, Roberts said, health care providers often prescribe antibiotics based on symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitlxbo9000t3b6qvr1eowu2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s pretty simple to do a five-day course of azithromycin – it’s called a Z-pak – that, in almost all cases, is just going to kill the pertussis right away,” he said. Given the cost and logistics of testing, “Most of the time, [doctors] will say, ‘let’s do the Z-pak and see how it goes.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixdkyai00003b6qme2dlz0r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children and infants are especially at risk of severe illness, and certain symptoms should signal when whooping cough becomes an emergency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitl8h9600073b6q37szspj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Signs of shortness of breath, such as a child struggling to catch their breath or a baby’s skin turning blue, require immediate medical care. Infants are at higher risk of severe illness because their respiratory and immune systems are still developing, but severe cases are rare when children have been vaccinated, Roberts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrk1g7s001b3b6skd0txjsd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Monday, health officials in South Carolina urged residents to ensure that they’re up-to-date on vaccinations amid a “concerning uptick” in cases of measles, whooping cough and chickenpox.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrka27g001m3b6szm3kd2sf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The unfortunate increase in these diseases is linked to declining vaccination coverage in that region and, frankly, across the state,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist and Health Programs Branch director, said of the Upstate region’s large ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/health/measles-surge-us-south-carolina"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjrka27g001n3b6si8ym6ln6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This trend is both preventable and reversible,” Bell said in a news release. “Vaccines are one of the most effective tools we have for protecting our communities. When people choose not to vaccinate, outbreaks become more likely. Choosing not to vaccinate can not only put yourself at risk but also your neighbors, loved ones, and others in and beyond your community.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz000z3b6nssb6d14w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Local health departments across the country have noticed declining vaccination rates. Dr. Raynard Washington, director of Mecklenburg County Public Health in North Carolina, said the county usually saw one or two whooping cough cases annually before numbers spiked to 68 in 2024. By October 2025, the county had recorded 48 cases this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00103b6ncfa6vvto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve certainly seen an uptick here, particularly in younger children,” Washington said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitli3tj000i3b6qbml6cwd4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many cases are among those not up to date on the five-dose childhood series, and there are often clusters in communities where families delay or decline vaccines. “It does put more people in those neighborhoods at risk,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00113b6n8m1gs4mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Older adults are also a concern, he added, given their more vulnerable immune systems. He recommends that grandparents and other older adults “talk to their providers about anything they can do to protect themselves.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00123b6nweyoxv5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Phil Huang, director and health authority of Dallas County Health and Human Services in Texas, said the county had 40 cases in 2023, 160 in 2024 and at least 195 this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00133b6nvllvej0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to data from the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;, kindergarten vaccination rates against pertussis were estimated to have dropped from almost 94% in the 2023–24 school year to less than 90% in 2024–25 in Dallas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00153b6nw15ucfj3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Huang said the best thing parents can do is to ensure that their children are fully vaccinated. “That’s the best protection that we can do,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitlkzbe000m3b6q0cabxjlq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roberts added that families should monitor local public health department websites for nearby cases, which may affect how doctors approach cold- or flu-like symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmitfroqz00173b6nwulzgyuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If parents are concerned or the symptoms just aren’t going away after a couple weeks, you know that’s a time to come in and go see your doctor,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

He seems to enjoy the process, leaving him with pure joy as he plays with his toy. Meanwhile, netizens cannot keep calm as they watch the pup’s adorable reactions. They call him the “cutest dog ever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Little puppy unwraps Christmas present and finds new squeaky toy inside&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-reacts-mom-hanging-124017130.html" data-ylk="slk:cute dog video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;cute dog video&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram, a little puppy gently unwraps his Christmas present. It begins with a Jack Russell Terrier named Kobe wagging his tail in excitement when his dog mom gives him a gift. She tells the pup that his “Mummy and Daddy” have a Christmas present for him. Then, the woman gives something wrapped in green festive wrapping paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kobe gladly accepts the gift, holding it in his mouth. In the background, his dog dad cheers the fur baby, chanting, “Open! Open!” Meanwhile, Kobe starts to tear the wrapper slowly. Without losing patience, he unwraps the present calmly till each paper falls on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although the dog dad tries to help the pet, Kobe seems to be doing fine on his own after a while. Throughout the unwrapping process, the pet parents don’t stop cheering their pooch.

Interest in providing the coverage “appears to be waning,” the survey found,  probably because of the drugs’ cost and other state budget pressures. North Carolina pulled back GLP-1 coverage in October, but &lt;a class="link" href="https://governor.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2025/12/10/governor-stein-continues-stand-3-million-medicaid-patients-north-carolina-directs-ncdhhs-restore" target="_blank"&gt;Gov. Josh Stein &lt;/a&gt;reinstated it in December, bowing to court orders despite a lingering budget shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catherine Ferguson, vice president of federal advocacy for the American Diabetes Assn. and its affiliated Obesity Assn., said it’s unclear how states will adjust to the White House plan to lower the cost of several of the most popular GLP-1s through TrumpRx, an online portal for discounted prescription drugs. The price of Wegovy, for example, will be $350 per month for consumers, versus the current list price of nearly $1,350, and Medicare and Medicaid programs will pay $245, according to the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many states are facing budgetary challenges, such as deficits, and are working to address the impacts of the changes to Medicaid and SNAP,” Ferguson wrote, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. “As more details become available for the Administration’s agreements, we will see how state Medicaid responds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services referred questions to the White House, which did not respond to requests for comment on states’ termination of Medicaid coverage for the weight-loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California projected its costs to cover GLP-1s for weight loss would have more than quadrupled over four years to &lt;a class="link" href="https://ebudget.ca.gov/2025-26/pdf/Enacted/BudgetSummary/HealthandHumanServices.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;nearly $800 million annually&lt;/a&gt; if it didn’t end Medi-Cal coverage for that use. Medi-Cal has covered weight-loss drugs since 2006, but use of GLP-1s soared only in recent years. By 2024, more than 645,000 prescriptions were covered by Medi-Cal across all uses of the medications. The California Department of Health Care Services could not readily provide a breakdown of whether the drugs were for weight loss or other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether the state would reconsider its plans in light of the announced price cuts, Department of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer said it had no plans to do so. California’s cut is written into &lt;a class="link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB101" target="_blank"&gt;the state’s budget law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California officials would not say how much it could save under the TrumpRx plan, citing federal and state restrictions on disclosing rebate information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers don’t expect the Trump administration’s negotiated price cuts to make much difference to consumers, because pharmaceutical companies already offer discounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The out-of-pocket costs will still be very cost-prohibitive for most, especially individuals with Medicaid insurance,” Thiara said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://nh.primetherapeutics.com/documents/51139/51630/Notification%252010.09.2025%2520-%2520GLP-1%2520Coverage%2520Change/218c7285-7968-9484-a244-859e0741eeba" target="_blank"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; will also end its coverage Jan. 1. Officials with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1 in 8 adults are taking a GLP-1 drug for obesity, disease or both, up 6 percentage points from May 2024, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-health-tracking-poll-prescription-drug-costs-views-on-trump-administration-actions-and-glp-1-use/" target="_blank"&gt;KFF poll results&lt;/a&gt; released in November. More than half of users said their GLP-1s were difficult to afford, and many who had stopped the treatment cited the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public and private payers have been trying to &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/glp-1-weight-loss-diabetes-drugs-cost-deprescription-medicaid-north-carolina/" target="_blank"&gt;wean patients off&lt;/a&gt; of the drugs to save costs. California health officials said Medi-Cal members and their healthcare providers &lt;a class="link" href="https://medi-calrx.dhcs.ca.gov/cms/medicalrx/static-assets/documents/provider/publications/2025.10_A_Important_Update_GLP-1s_Weight_Loss_Not_Covered_Benefit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;should consider&lt;/a&gt; “other treatment options that can support weight loss, such as diet changes, increased activity or exercise, and counseling.” That echoes advice from the New Hampshire Medicaid program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California Department of Health Care Services spokesperson Tessa Outhyse said in an email that the official advice to try those other approaches now “is not meant to dismiss any past efforts, but to encourage Medi-Cal members to take a renewed, proactive, and medically supported approach with their healthcare provider that may appropriately include these additional options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that may be unrealistic, said &lt;a class="link" href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/kurt-hong/" target="_blank"&gt;Kurt Hong&lt;/a&gt;, founding director of the Center for Clinical Nutrition at Keck School of Medicine of USC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We definitely want patients to do their part with the diet and exercise, but unfortunately, and from a practical standpoint, that itself frequently is not enough,” Hong said, adding that usually by the time patients see doctors, they have failed at achieving results through those means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong understands why Medicaid programs, as well as private providers, want to cut back on covering the drugs, which can cost &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/press-release/costly-glp-1-drugs-are-rarely-covered-for-weight-loss-by-marketplace-plans/" target="_blank"&gt;thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt; per patient per year. However, they can produce twice the weight loss as the medications typically used previously, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A school of medical thought supports people gradually ending their use, but Hong said obesity is generally considered a chronic condition that requires indefinite treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once they reach their target weight, a lot of people will try to see whether or not they can wean off,” Hong said. “We do see a lot of patients — when they try to get off, unfortunately, then the weight comes back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medi-Cal members younger than 21 will &lt;a class="link" href="https://medi-calrx.dhcs.ca.gov/member/state-budget-updates/" target="_blank"&gt;remain covered&lt;/a&gt; for purposes including weight loss, California officials said, citing a federal requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medi-Cal members will be able to keep their GLP-1 coverage if they can demonstrate it is medically necessary for purposes other than weight loss, the Department of Health Care Services said. Members who are denied coverage can seek a hearing, the department said in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.medi-calrx.dhcs.ca.gov/cms/medicalrx/static-assets/documents/member/letters/GLP-1_Weight_Loss.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; to members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members will still be able to pay for the prescriptions out of pocket and may be able to use various discounts to lower costs. Another option is new pills to treat obesity, which will be cheaper than their injectable counterparts. The Food and Drug Administration approved a pill version of Wegovy on Dec. 22, which probably will cost $149 a month for the lowest dosage, and similar weight-loss pills are expected to be available in the first half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Cardenas said his husband, Jeffer Jimenez, 37, uses GLP-1s primarily for weight loss, Jimenez’s prescription is for diabetes, so the couple hoped to continue receiving coverage through Medi-Cal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He tried a thousand medications, pills, natural teas, exercise program, but it doesn’t work like the injections,” Cardenas said. “You need both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thompson writes for&lt;/i&gt;

The family had donated the patient's body to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The team learned that pig organs were being rejected due to an immune system reaction from specific antibodies -- which recognize and attach themselves to foreign substances so they can be removed from the body -- and from T cells, which are white blood cells that help the body fight off germs and other unfamiliar invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;'So you have this very coordinated immune response that involves antibodies and white cells, and it seems to happen somewhere between two and four weeks after the transplant," said Montgomery, lead author of the study. "Now the good news on that front is that we can detect when it's coming before rejection happens, and we can begin to respond, and we have very good therapeutics that can block the rejection and prevent it from causing damage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;After rejection, the team used an FDA-approved drug combination to successfully reverse it, with no signs of permanent damage or reduced kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a second study, Montgomery and his team looked at the body's immune response to the pig organ in greater detail. By measuring levels of biomarkers in the blood, they were able to spot an attack up to five days before it would be visible in bodily tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Montgomery said the findings could lead to a future where gene-edited pig organs are a realistic alternative to human organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The pig organ can really replace a human organ and do all the things that a human organ can do, and it's really just a matter of overcoming the immunosuppression and preventing rejection," he said. "I think it's going to happen ... and people will be receiving xenotransplants on a regular basis. It's going to be normalized, and it's going to be something that will benefit thousands, first, and then millions of people around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;FDA clears 1st blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In May, the FDA cleared the first blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The test, manufactured by Fujirebio Diagnostics, is for those aged 55 and older who are already exhibiting signs and symptoms of the disease, according to the federal health agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The new blood test works by measuring the ratio of two proteins -- pTau217 and β-amyloid 1-42 -- which are found in human plasma, a component of blood.

test is rapid, highly accurate and less expensive or invasive compared to previous diagnostic tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Because many Alzheimer's

However, Texas-based vascular surgeon Dr Rema Malik believes that the persistent nighttime cramps are not just signs of dehydration or low &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/warning-signs-and-symptoms-of-dangerously-low-potassium-levels-101679753190357.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="potassium"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, but rather classic distress signals from the vascular system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Taking to Instagram on November 4, Dr Malik shared the two main vascular causes that she looks out for when it comes to leg cramps at night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Venous Insufficiency (The "Pressure" Problem)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Malik, this is the predominant vascular cause for leg cramps at night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“After a long day of sitting or standing, blood pools in your lower legs. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;At night, that stagnant, waste-filled blood and fluid can irritate your nerves and muscles, triggering intense cramps and that awful ‘restless legs’ feeling,” she explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Peripheral Artery Disease (The "Flow" Problem)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Also known as “rest pain,” the peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an advanced case of clogged arteries, where the leg muscles are deprived of oxygen even while the body is at rest.&lt;/span&gt; The condition can threaten the limb itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such leg cramps cannot be clubbed with the normal effects of ageing, cautioned Dr Malik. The risk significantly increases after the age of 40 for venous insufficiency, and after the age of 50 for PAD, she added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

              &lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Five years ago, Tim Cannon, a cancer doctor in Virginia, saw that his &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/true-cost-young-colon-cancer-crisis-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; patients were getting younger and their cancer was more aggressive. He had just diagnosed three people in their 30s with late-stage colon cancer. More perplexing, all three were athletes who competed in long-distance, endurance sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Within a six-month period, I saw three extreme athletes in their 30s with metastatic, very advanced, incurable colon cancer," Cannon told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three patients died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannon had a hunch that this pattern wasn't an anomaly. He examined 100 more long-distance runners between 35 and 50 years old and found that 39 had developed precancerous tumors in their colons. Fifteen of those cases were advanced — far more than the expected 1.2%. Nearly one-sixth of all the runners were at risk of developing colon cancer. It was startling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannon's research, which is still in its early stages, points to broader questions that have confounded the medical community:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Why are so many &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-uncover-processed-foods-fuel-colon-cancer-how-offset-damage-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;young, fit adults getting sick&lt;/a&gt; and dying from colon and rectal cancer? And why are these patients — people who are younger than 45, the age at which screening is first recommended — getting the most aggressive forms of the disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The steepest rise is in people in their 20s and 30s," said Dr. Kimmie Ng, director of Dana-Farber's Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center. "They're younger, they're healthier, they don't have comorbidities, they get more treatment — and yet they're not living longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Business Insider reported on the leading scientific theories for &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;why people with clean diets get colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Possible answers ranged from microplastics to antibiotics. Leading theories generally pinpointed the modern diet, including too much sugar, and other facts of modern life, like staring into the blue light of our phones late at night, which can disrupt our natural rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
            
          
            
          &lt;p&gt;These factors are likely part of the picture, oncologists say. But there's more to explore. Clusters of early-onset cancers like the one that Cannon says he identified are helping us gain a better understanding of the disease — and some answers for what ordinary people can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer researchers are discovering how different environmental factors interact with our systems in complex ways and at different points of our development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="callout-box headline-regular ignore-typography"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Insider spent a year investigating the impact the rise in young cancers is having on Americans — financially, emotionally, professionally — and how patients, and the healthcare system, are coping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See more in our series, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-people-cancer-crisis-risk-tips-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"callout_box","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The True Cost of Young Cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they're increasingly zeroing in on the first year of life — from birth itself to our first months out of the womb — for answers about &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-people-cancer-crisis-risk-tips-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;young cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Some early research is scratching at the idea that a vulnerability to colorectal cancer could start in infancy — suggesting the first months and years of life could be a key window for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-right" data-quote="&amp;quot;Something that happened at age six months, you don't even consider when you're 35. That disconnect is extremely problematic.&amp;quot;" data-source=""&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-right"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;"Something that happened at age six months, you don't even consider when you're 35. That disconnect is extremely problematic."&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At UC San Diego, molecular biologist Ludmil Alexandrov recently identified a mutational signature in more than half of colorectal tumors found in patients under 40 that appears to be caused by colibactin, a toxin produced by a specific strain of E. coli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What startled researchers was the timing of the damage. Cancer researchers typically find DNA damage building up in the adult body. Smoking, grilling meats, work like mining or asbestos-spraying — these well-trodden cancer triggers are typically ignited when our DNA is already becoming more decrepit and unstable, with time and age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here — according to the paper Alexandrov published in Nature in April — the infection had occurred before babies reached their ninth month of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexandrov's research, while preliminary, suggests infants can be hit with DNA mutations just months into their lives that might leave them predisposed to developing cancer within a few decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You get your first hit at age 1 instead of age 30," Alexandrov said. "So you are about 20 to 30 years ahead of schedule for cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Something that happened at age 6 months," Alexandrov added, "you don't even consider when you're 35."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That disconnect is extremely problematic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Alexandrov's finding is confirmed in bigger studies, it could reframe the mystery of early-onset colorectal cancer. The rise could be rooted in early life, with early adulthood simply being the point at which the long incubation period finally comes to a head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If colibactin infections are a major early trigger, the most effective strategy may be preventing that mutational DNA damage in the first place. The next generation of cancer prevention may involve targeted microbial restoration and dietary strategies designed for an infant's developing immune system. Alexandrov envisions targeted probiotics for infants that neutralize colibactin-producing bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can monitor the mutations and see that the ones exposed to the probiotic don't appear," he said, it could mean "we're eliminating the cause."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ng says Alexandrov's findings "cement a role of the microbiome in this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifts in how babies eat, including more ultra-processed food and fewer fiber-rich ingredients, could drive up colibactin infection rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While researchers suspect that colibactin infections in infants have been on the rise in recent decades, there isn't enough data yet to say for sure. More study is also needed to confirm the link of any such rise to colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just diet that could be playing a role in the rise. Researchers are also looking at shifting trends in &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; babies are born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Our first moments of life are a pivotal training ground for the gut — a baby's welcome party to our diverse world of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies born vaginally pass through the birth canal and pick up critical microbial communities from their mothers — microbes that help train the immune system. C-section babies start life with different microbes, and the evidence is mounting that these early differences may have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is strong evidence that early-life microbial disruption can influence long-term health risk," said Dr. Maria Gloria Domínguez-Bello, a professor at Rutgers University who has pioneered infant microbiome research and looked at the links between an infant's microbiome and their risk for adult diseases, including IBS, ulcerative colitis, and colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that modern changes to birth and feeding practices may lead to subtle yet consequential disruptions to the microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Domínguez-Bello launched a landmark study on "vaginal seeding" — taking babies born via C-section and coating them with bacteria from the mother's vaginal canal. It will be years before we know the effectiveness of this approach, but the hope is that this small intervention may have bolstered their microbiome from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, there's feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breastfeeding is one of the ways infants acquire early protective microbes. Breastmilk is packed with complex sugars — human milk oligosaccharides — that babies' gut bacteria can feed on, shaping the early immune system. It can also contain traces of what the mother ingests or has been exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple large-scale studies have found that the gut bacteria of formula-fed babies tend to differ from those of breastfed babies. While questions remain, this research is reshaping the infant formula market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies like Biomilq and Helaina are developing "microbiome-friendly" formulas that contain synthetic versions of the complex sugars found in breastmilk. Early clinical trials show these products can nudge a baby's gut bacteria to look more breastfed, though whether that matters decades later remains unknown. Still, these formulas have become one of the fastest-growing segments of the infant nutrition industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Consuming too much sugar is emerging as a key culprit that may be shaping what happens to our microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ng's group has found that sugary diets — especially sugary drinks including soda, juice, and sports drinks — are associated with a higher risk of early-onset colon cancer.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Food that spikes insulin or glucose "is linked with a higher risk of colorectal cancer," too, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrea Cercek at Memorial Sloan Kettering noticed something else: Among her youngest patients with stage 4 cancer, sugar consumption stood out. "There were slight differences in risk factors — and sugars in particular," Cercek said. The idea aligns with prior studies showing that fructose can accelerate polyp growth in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-quote='"A high fiber diet produces metabolites that suppress colon cancer risk. A high saturated meat diet produces metabolites that are inflammatory and carcinogenic."' data-source=""&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout"&gt;&lt;q class="pullquote-quotation heading-md"&gt;"A high fiber diet produces metabolites that suppress colon cancer risk. A high saturated meat diet produces metabolites that are inflammatory and carcinogenic."&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/es-blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't mean sugar "causes" cancer. But modern, ultra-high levels of sugar intake may be accelerating disease in people whose risk was primed early. And they're crowding out what people once used&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to balance out sugar's effect on the body, improving blood sugar and aiding digestion at the same time: fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar can be great for a quick burst of energy, but in the long run, we need fiber to slow it down and promote good gut health. This is especially true of resistant starch (beans, lentils, oats), the type that ferments in the gut and produces short-chain fatty acids that suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stephen O'Keefe, who studies Alaska Native communities with historically high colorectal cancer rates, recently found that adding a resistant starch supplement to people's diets for just four weeks had measurable effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The supplementation did suppress cancer biomarkers," he said, discussing the findings he presented to colleagues at Digestive Disease Week 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A high fiber diet produces metabolites that suppress colon cancer risk," he said. "A high saturated meat diet produces metabolites that are inflammatory and carcinogenic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's seen this kind of thing before, noting important, negative microbial changes occurred quite rapidly when he fed rural, bean-eating South Africans typical American foods like hamburgers and hash browns for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Keefe believes increasing fiber intake could meaningfully offset other dietary risks, and perhaps reshape the microbiome in protective ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Once researchers began looking beyond diet, they started interrogating other environmental changes as possible multipliers of an individual's risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial light at night — particularly from phones — disrupts circadian rhythms that regulate DNA repair. Long periods of sitting can slow gut motility and increase inflammation. Air pollution inflames the gut lining and introduces carcinogenic particles directly to the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren't "causes" in isolation. But, together with nutrition and metabolism, they can disrupt how genes operate. Over time, these changes can trigger more disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the focus of Dr. Heinz-Josef Lenz's research at the University of Southern California Cancer Center. As a gastroenterologist, he has been troubled by a rise in young Latino men developing colon cancer in high school and college — many of them are athletic and healthy with no known risk factors. Lenz says their higher-than-average occurrence of young colon cancer is not due to any particular genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What can it be when it's not genetic? It could be epigenetic," he said. "Meaning, what you do, what you eat, what you drink, and related to your parents — how they acted and behaved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, he's seeing clues that young Latino athletes with colon cancer might be suffering from nutritional changes that span multiple generations, based on changes that are inherited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one 15-year-old in Los Angeles, it's possible that a daily Gatorade is enough to promote tumor growth in the colon, while for someone else with a different background, it's not such a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Lenz has seen some interesting data on fructose pathways that appear dysregulated in young colon cancer patients, he is cautious to point out that nothing has emerged that is definitively an "it" cancer-causer just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The data should be becoming available in the next one or two years," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is that, with time and some more research, Lenz will be able to better tailor treatments to a patient's genetics and background, making each one more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One promising target is the circadian rhythm, or a person's body clock. Lenz recently teamed up with top body clock researcher Dr. Steve Kay to examine the effects of manipulating the body clock on cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we found is that some circadian clock proteins our lab has been researching for many years are the 'gas pedal' to cancer," Kay said in a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://today.usc.edu/usc-researchers-pioneer-lifesaving-cancer-breakthroughs" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. "Out of that came a whole set of experiments that started to really blow all of us away. Drugs that my lab developed to target the circadian clock showed they could kill colorectal cancer cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;For oncologists, the rise in young cases is not just a scientific challenge. Young patients often arrive confused and ashamed because they believe cancer is strongly associated with their own lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannon says&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;this misconception adds to the pain. "The public understands cancer as more related to personal behavior than oncologists do," he said. "You don't have total control over this, as far as I can tell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the researchers we spoke to for this story cautioned that people shouldn't misinterpret this emerging science as a lifestyle playbook just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did encourage some lifestyle modifications. This includes&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;more fiber, less sugar, more movement, and better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the extreme athletes Cannon is studying, his own leading hypothesis is that the stress of extreme endurance training might starve intestinal tissue of oxygen and create more opportunities for cancerous mutations. His research is far from conclusive. "The theories are all over the place," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't want to overstate how much you can control this with any behavior," he said. "In the end, it's still a chance event."&lt;/p&gt;

That can mean joining a car ride, curling up for a nap on the couch, or simply following them from room to room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When they’re suddenly left out of a new activity, their confusion and disappointment can be hard to miss. A new video shows how a seemingly harmless home upgrade turned into an emotional yet funny moment for two very curious Golden Retrievers who just wanted to be included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retrievers react to being not allowed in the sauna in adorable video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wolfie and Pickles, two &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; brothers, are shown in a new video that captured their strong feelings about a sauna recently added to their home. The problem isn’t the sauna itself, it’s the fact that they’re not allowed inside. Shared by their paw parent on Instagram under the handle @lexiwolfiepickles, the video opens with the dogs peeking their heads through the slightly open sauna door, clearly determined to see what’s going on inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Onscreen text explains: “We got a new sauna &amp;amp; the boys aren’t happy about not being able to come in.” From the other side of the door, their mom films the scene while gently telling them they need to leave. Instead of backing away, Wolfie and Pickles lean in further, noses first, as if hoping persistence will change her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At one point, their mom lightly boops their noses to nudge them back and close the door. Pickles quickly appears, poking his head through the gap, while Wolfie becomes more vocal. As the door starts to close, Wolfie lets out a bark that sounds a lot like a protest, making it clear he strongly disagrees with this new rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A number of viewers reacted in the comments section, sharing their amusement and siding with the pups. One person joked that Wolfie “got mad” the moment the door started closing, while another teased, “Oh, you wanna relax? Not on my watch.” Several commenters pointed out that dogs often enjoy warm, steamy environments. One said, “Most dogs love to do that in my home country.” Others admitted they would be just as curious, and many demanded “justice for the pups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/200730-golden-retriever-video-sauna-adorable" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retrievers Aren’t Pleased About the New Sauna at Home;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retrievers Aren’t Pleased About the New Sauna at Home&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 08:09:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNWlc3c0E3a1lKQVdneE1ZU08wNnRYUFc5RXJnUHdhQk9zQmJQWk9kZ3FkV3pVeGFUV0cwdF94SE5IXzB1Y1dZSVF4bGpvM1REN1MwMXpIeklwVmZ4S1N2LXBzdVZGUGR2MUhwNENVN3NMMElpT0RzbDV1ZHd1WjhDTG1USUp1VVZVb1hYbjlGWQ</guid></item><item><title>这张栖息地沙发床白天和晚上都很好看| - Livingetc</title><link>https://www.livingetc.com/shopping/habitat-julien-sofa-bed</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

&lt;p id="8f43e770-973b-4324-8e2d-32d534af2a90"&gt;This Christmas, I spent a total of five nights in three different sofa beds. Throw in a few cross-country train trips, and my back was in all sorts of twists and bends. So, as much as I appreciated my family and friends for putting me up — my gosh, was I happy to get into my own (proper) bed at the end of all of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole experience has made me clear on one thing: I want to make sure my &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livingetc.com/buying-guides/best-sleeper-sofas-and-sofa-beds" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livingetc.com/buying-guides/best-sleeper-sofas-and-sofa-beds"&gt;sofa bed&lt;/a&gt; is as comfortable as possible for my future guests. But, considering it's not something you often ever use in your own home, it's hard to actually know what it's like to sleep in (unless you're willing to forgo your own bed for a few nights on the sofa). And it's even harder to test in a store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8f43e770-973b-4324-8e2d-32d534af2a90-2"&gt;So, instead, I'm reverse-engineering my research. Rather than telling you what I've bought, I'm sharing what you — our trusted &lt;em&gt;Livingetc &lt;/em&gt;readers — have bought.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="subtitle__description"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a simple fold-out mechanism, Habitat's Julien four-seater sofa bed easily slides between day and night. Probably not best used as your every-day sofa, but instead something styled in the spare room (its fixed cushions make it a bit harder to clean), it comes backed with a manufacturer's 10 year guarantee, can be delivered to your door from just £6.95, and is currently 20% off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="7f0a23cc-968c-4547-9988-604e2e8b6871"&gt;And look, it's not hard to see why. It seems someone has finally designed a sofa bed that looks just as good by day as it does at night. Comfortably seating four, it looks soft and squishy but still structured, and I particularly like the fitted cushions for a fuss-free look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its biggest selling point is that it's well... big. At least for a sofa bed. With the sleeping space measuring 137cm wide and 191cm long, it's equivalent to a UK double bed, while most sofa beds are much less (especially if you go down the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livingetc.com/shopping/ikea-armchair-bed" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livingetc.com/shopping/ikea-armchair-bed"&gt;armchair-bed&lt;/a&gt; route). In fact, it's a wide enough &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livingetc.com/advice/how-to-convert-a-sofa-into-a-bed" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livingetc.com/advice/how-to-convert-a-sofa-into-a-bed"&gt;sofa that you could probably convert it into a bed&lt;/a&gt; without even folding it out (if you're only sleeping one).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't just take it from me (as, truthfully, I haven't slept on it) — take it from the countless reviews that real customers have left:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="847c6c3a-6e83-4d1d-ac28-c33a28d588fa"&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Great quality for the cost, and the delivery men were lovely."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"A number of guests have now used this sofa bed since our purchase last month — all comment on how comfortable it is."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Does not look like a sofa bed, is the easiest to &lt;a href="https://www.livingetc.com/advice/how-to-style-a-sofa-bed" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livingetc.com/advice/how-to-style-a-sofa-bed"&gt;convert into a sofa bed&lt;/a&gt; I've ever used, and is super comfortable."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Really comfy &lt;a href="https://www.livingetc.com/advice/sofa-depth" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livingetc.com/advice/sofa-depth"&gt;deep sofa&lt;/a&gt; with a good quality fabric. The arms are low, and it's good for lounging. The bed makes up very easily; it's big, firm, and comfortable. You can store bedding underneath when the sofa is up."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="7c0e6e05-ba4b-4aa2-9050-26d14efdb643"&gt;But if a natural &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livingetc.com/advice/best-sofa-colors" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livingetc.com/advice/best-sofa-colors"&gt;sofa color&lt;/a&gt; feels too dangerous for your household, it also comes in a dark green corduroy-style fabric, although it's not on sale and only available through Argos (it's sold out on Habitat, though it's still the same sofa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the look, but don't actually need a sofa bed?

			&lt;p&gt;KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Ministry of Health and Wellness is assuring the public that chemicals being used in fogging activities are considered safe for human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fogging is being conducted in several communities to control the increase in the mosquito population since Hurricane Melissa. Speaking with JIS News, Portfolio Minister, Dr Christopher Tufton, said that fogging is a “safe method” for getting rid of mosquitoes that transmit dengue and other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted that over the years, the insecticides used have “improved significantly” and “are a lot more environmentally friendly”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is not going to kill anyone or harm anyone, and it does get rid of the nuisance or the health risk of the mosquito. So, I would encourage persons to have the foggers do what they have to do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We encourage persons who may have an allergy or an allergic reaction to avoid being overly exposed to the mist… or apply a [damp] cloth over the nose until the mist dissipates. But it is a safe method,” the minister assured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical Entomologist and National Programme Manager for Vector Control in the Ministry, Sherine Huntley Jones, told &lt;strong&gt;JIS News&lt;/strong&gt; that the chemicals being used for fogging are certified and approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She assured that they are being used as directed by the manufacturers, so there is no need to fear any adverse health effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntley Jones noted that there has been an increase in fogging activities post Hurricane Melissa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ministry is on high alert for increased transmission in mosquito-borne diseases and has enhanced its mosquito control programme, which includes expansion of our fogging schedule as well as our larvicidal schedule,” she said, noting that operations will decrease over time “as we become satisfied that we are not going to see an increase or have an outbreak”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where individuals experience any difficulty with the process, they are advised to contact the health department in their parish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want to assure the public that the chemicals are safe and the activity of fogging is necessary at this time to mitigate…  the impact of the hurricane and a possible increase in the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases,” Huntley Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, she is encouraging members of the public to do their part in controlling mosquito breeding in and around their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is by taking the time to search their yards and their environment for any containers or anything that can hold water that might increase mosquito breeding because the more the public does, the less the ministry will have to do. If we all begin to take action, then we can together and collectively see a reduction in the mosquito population and reduce that risk of an outbreak,” she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO advises that the amount of insecticide used during fogging is very small and dispersed at quantities that are only effective at killing small insects like mosquitoes. At these low concentrations, there are no expected adverse health effects on people who are occasionally exposed to the fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organisation recommends an integrated vector management (IVM) approach for mosquito control, focusing on proven methods like Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs), Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), and using United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered repellents (DEET, Picaridin), alongside environmental management (removing standing water) to prevent breeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flu cases are ticking up this year, and the illness is spreading fast and hitting hard. Preliminary &lt;a href="https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/visualizations?PageType=ps&amp;amp;PopulationSource=Syndromic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NYC hospital data&lt;/a&gt; indicate more people visited the ER for flu symptoms the week before Christmas than they did during any other week in the last decade. The strain even earned itself the title of the ‘&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/26/health/super-flu-sends-nyc-flu-cases-to-highest-level-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Super Flu&lt;/a&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As someone who just recovered from a two-week-long bout with it, I can confirm the so-called Super Flu was just as gnarly as people were saying it was. Besides sitting in bed, sleeping it off and sniffling up a storm, the one thing that helped me feel a little less like a zombie was my &lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="B07D47RFBH" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEmergen-C-26595-242723-Raspbry%2Fdp%2FB07D47RFBH%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F12%2F29%2Fshopping%2Fi-fought-the-nyc-super-flu-with-12-emergen-c-from-amazon%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;daily dose of Vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A single serving of &lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="B07D47RFBH" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEmergen-C-26595-242723-Raspbry%2Fdp%2FB07D47RFBH%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F12%2F29%2Fshopping%2Fi-fought-the-nyc-super-flu-with-12-emergen-c-from-amazon%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Emergen-C powder&lt;/a&gt; delivers 1,000 mg of vitamin C‚ which accounts for about the same amount you’d get from 10 oranges. It’s also packed with B vitamins, antioxidants like zinc and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-electrolyte-powders-drinks-per-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;electrolytes&lt;/a&gt;, which can help with hydration when you’re under the weather. The powder mixes easily and, in my opinion, tastes like a refreshing raspberry lemonade, so taking it is really no hassle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder that reviewers rave that it’s a cold-season “health essential.” While it didn’t ease &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; my flu symptoms, I felt that my daily dose of Emergen-C gave me the energy boost I needed to take care of myself and my sick toddler — and that made it feel like the best $12 I’d ever spent. &lt;/p&gt;

These incoming signals are created when neurons release glutamate, a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in brain communication. Although glutamate is essential for processes like learning and memory, its activity has been extremely difficult to measure because the signals are faint and happen very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new tool makes it possible to detect those subtle chemical messages as they arrive, giving researchers access to a part of brain communication that has long been hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this discovery matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to observe incoming signals allows scientists to study how neurons process information. Each brain cell receives thousands of inputs, and how it combines those signals determines whether it produces an output. This process is thought to underlie decisions, thoughts, and memories, and studying it directly could help explain how the brain performs complex computations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advance also opens new paths for disease research. Problems with glutamate signaling have been linked to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, and others. By measuring these signals more precisely, researchers may be able to identify the biological roots of these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug development could also benefit. Pharmaceutical companies can use these sensors to see how experimental treatments affect real synaptic activity, which may help speed up the search for more effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introducing a powerful glutamate sensor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protein was engineered by researchers at the Allen Institute and HHMI's Janelia Research Campus. Known as iGluSnFR4 (pronounced 'glue sniffer'), it acts as a molecular "glutamate indicator." Its sensitivity allows it to detect even the weakest incoming signals exchanged between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By revealing when and where glutamate is released, iGluSnFR4 provides a new way to interpret the complex patterns of brain activity that support learning, memory, and emotion. It gives scientists the ability to watch neurons communicate inside the brain in real time. The findings were recently published in Nature Methods and could significantly change how neural activity is measured and analyzed in neuroscience research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How brain cells communicate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the impact of this advance, it helps to look at how neurons interact. The brain contains billions of neurons that communicate by sending electrical signals along branch-like structures called axons. When an electrical signal reaches the end of an axon, it cannot cross the small gap to the next neuron, which is known as a synapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the signal triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. Glutamate is the most common of these chemical messengers and plays a key role in memory, learning, and emotion. When glutamate reaches the next neuron, it can cause that cell to fire, continuing the chain of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From fragments to the full conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process can be compared to falling dominos, but it is far more complex. Each neuron receives input from thousands of others, and only certain combinations and patterns of activity will trigger the receiving neuron to fire. With this new protein sensor, scientists can now identify which patterns of incoming activity lead to that response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, observing these incoming signals in living brain tissue was nearly impossible. Previous technologies were too slow or lacked the sensitivity needed to measure activity at individual synapses. As a result, researchers could only see pieces of the communication process rather than the full exchange. This new approach allows them to capture the entire conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making sense of neural connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like reading a book with all the words scrambled and not understanding the order of the words or how they're arranged," said Kaspar Podgorski, Ph.D., a lead author of the study and senior scientist at the Allen Institute. "I feel like what we're doing here is adding the connections between those neurons and by doing that, we now understand the order of the words on the pages, and what they mean."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before protein sensors like iGluSnFR4 were available, researchers could only measure outgoing signals from neurons. This left a major gap in understanding, since the incoming signals were too fast and too faint to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Neuroscientists have pretty good ways of measuring structural connections between neurons, and in separate experiments, we can measure what some of the neurons in the brain are saying, but we haven't been good at combining these two kinds of information. It's hard to measure what neurons are saying to which other neurons," Podgorski said. "What we have invented here is a way of measuring information that comes into neurons from different sources, and that's been a critical part missing from neuroscience research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration behind the breakthrough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The success of iGluSnFR4 stems from our close collaboration started at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus between the GENIE Project team and Kaspar's lab. That research has extended to the phenomenal in vivo characterization work done by the Allen Institute's Neural Dynamics group," said Jeremy Hasseman, Ph.D., a scientist with HHMI's Janelia Research Campus. "This was a great example of collaboration across labs and institutes to enable new discoveries in neuroscience."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new window into brain function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery overcomes a major limitation in modern neuroscience by making it possible to directly observe how neurons receive information. With iGluSnFR4 now available to researchers through Addgene, scientists have a powerful new tool to explore brain function in greater detail. As this technology spreads, it may help reveal answers to some of the brain's most enduring questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Keith Ellis, the medical director of cardiology at Houston Methodist Sugar Land Hospital in Texas. “Or typically, people describe a butterfly in the chest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fluttering might be harmless. But it might not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellis said the concern comes if a person experiences atrial fibrillation, which, if left untreated, can increase a person’s risk of stroke, heart failure and cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellis said doctors see an increase in patients with A-fib around the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anybody, regardless of their health status, can experience holiday heart syndrome. But there are health factors that increase the risk of experiencing holiday heart syndrome. Those include age, high blood pressure, diabetes and sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption plays a big factor in holiday heart syndrome, Ellis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated heavy drinking can shift what starts as a temporary disturbance into chronic A-fib, according to Houston Methodist. Five drinks a day increases A-fib risk by almost 50%, the hospital said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2025/dec/holiday-heart-syndrome-why-your-heart-might-be-working-overtime-this-season/" target="_blank"&gt;Holiday heart syndrome symptoms&lt;/a&gt; typically show up 12 to 36 hours after drinking and can include rapid or irregular heartbeat, palpitations, lightheadedness or dizziness, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or sudden fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to limiting alcohol, Ellis said people can reduce their risk of experiencing holiday heart syndrome by staying hydrated, going easy on the salt, getting enough sleep, and staying physically active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellis said anyone who experiences persistent palpitations, which he described as over 30 seconds, should reach out to their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I typically advise patients that if you experience any type of fluttering or palpitation to definitely reach out to your physician in consultation,” he said. “And there are a number of devices that are available that allow us to monitor a person's heart rhythm in the outpatient setting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:07:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQdWZEczlNOTd6SkNzbE4yN3Jad3pacVhpZ2dSdXJObk5HSzRiZURaUGpWOU5GT190T21zQnFzaF9LMFNzOERDODIzM2VmRVBmbkFUQUVEMmRCRmo2N0xXdVh0NDNyblNvYkJNM0VoOGxZb09NYndWcUhQOFdaSGJvbzhnVkVKV2xzNFpnbHRHcjlvMVVqTFpjUXB4b045aEI2aUpaVkNQbUQ3UnptRkRudEJ3WVdyWnc</guid></item><item><title>流感病例在假期旅行、聚会、疾病预防控制中心最新数据显示中呈上升趋势- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/flu-cases-rise-amid-holiday-travel-gatherings-latest/story?id=128761006</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Flu activity is increasing across the U.S. amid holiday travel and gatherings, according to the latest data the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC estimates there have been at least 4.6 million illnesses, 49,000 hospitalizations and 1,900 deaths from flu this season so far, according to data updated as of Dec. 19, and experts expect these numbers will continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Public health experts previously told ABC News that many of this season's cases are linked to a new flu strain called subclade K -- a variant of the H3N2 virus, which is itself a subtype of influenza A -- that has been circulating since the summer in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Of the 163 samples of H3N2 viruses collected since Sept. 28 and genetically characterized, 89% were subclade K, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, three pediatric flu deaths have been reported so far this season, according to an ABC News tally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Last season, the U.S. saw 288 children die from flu, which is the same number of children who died during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
