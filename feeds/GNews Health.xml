			&lt;p&gt;With ChatGPT's constant evolution and advancement as a tool, many have started relying excessively on it, not just for streamlining their tasks and everyday life but also for deeply personal matters. We have heard some &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/after-12-years-of-marriage-woman-files-for-divorce-after-chatgpt-claims-her-husbands-infidelity-through-coffee-grounds-interpretation/"&gt;bizarre cases&lt;/a&gt; of marriages ending due to the tool tracing evidence of infidelity, and even people &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/sam-altman-issues-chilling-warning-chatgpt-is-not-a-therapist-your-deepest-secrets-could-be-used-against-you-in-court-with-no-legal-protection/"&gt;relying &lt;/a&gt;on the chatbot for therapy, which Sam Altman has warned against. Now, a troubling case has come forward where the risk of relying on the AI assistant for health guidance has arisen. A 60-year-old man in New York is said to have developed a rare and dangerous condition after following the dietary advice laid out by the model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hidden-dangers-of-ai-health-tips-bromism-and-the-salt-alternative-that-went-too-far"&gt;The hidden dangers of AI health tips: Bromism and the salt alternative that went too far&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we have been hearing about not relying on any AI model excessively from time to time, a recent warning comes from the U.S. medical journal against seeking medical advice from ChatGPT after a man fell seriously ill following dietary advice from the chatbot, as highlighted by&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/man-asked-chatgpt-cutting-salt-diet-was-hospitalized-hallucinations-rcna225055"&gt; NBC&lt;/a&gt; News. The case has been published in the&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where an extensive report about a 60-year-old man who developed bromism, also known as bromide poisoning, after acting on the guidance of the AI assistant has been published.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The poor man developed the rare and dangerous condition after he replaced common table salt (sodium chloride) with sodium bromide, a substance he obtained online. ChatGPT gave advice when he inquired about a potential substitute for salt. The man consumed the sodium bromide daily for three months, believing it to be a healthier alternative. The outcome of this, however, was devastating as he developed paranoia, insomnia, psychosis, and other severe physical symptoms, making him think at one point in time that he was being poisoned by one of his neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The man ended up being hospitalized, where the doctors diagnosed bromism, which is the toxic reaction to excessive bromide exposure. After he stopped consuming bromide and received the necessary treatment, his symptoms began to resolve. While the condition is hardly seen these days due to the rare availability of bromide salts, the case does serve as a reminder against substances like these that can be purchased online without much oversight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patient’s story also raises alarm about how AI should be used with caution, especially in health contexts. The researchers even looked into whether or not ChatGPT was giving such responses, and it was, in fact, suggesting bromide as an alternative to chloride. No warning of toxicity was given, making the responses even more concerning. Chatbots cannot be medical professionals and offer the same judgment and responsibility, and thus, they should not be taken as experts in the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, AI models should come with better safety guardrails, especially when it comes to sensitive topics. We live in an age of AI tools; thus, curiosity should not overlap with caution and should never outweigh professional advice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Cleveland Clinic microbiome expert Gail Cresci describes these microbes as "little pets living inside your intestinal tract." They help break down food, regulate inflammation, support immunity and even produce essential compounds like vitamins and hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-poop-trying-tell-about-gut-health/#link={%22linkText%22:%22gut%20health%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-poop-trying-tell-about-gut-health/%22,%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22}" target="_self"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt; is essential to overall health, it's important to pay attention to signs that it may be unhealthy.

Studies are also looking into how the gut biome &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/hropen/article/2022/2/hoac015/6553029" target="_self"&gt;impacts reproductive health&lt;/a&gt; and hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to keep your gut healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to see a doctor to determine the root cause of your health concern and rule out other conditions. Making changes to your diet or routine that may improve your gut and overall health is a good first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cresci also said that there's no exact standard for the perfectly healthy gut microbiome since everyone's composition is so different. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Carol Yepes/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Eat these gut-friendly foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/high-fiber-foods-to-improve-your-digestion/" target="_self"&gt;foods with a lot of fiber&lt;/a&gt;, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber should be removed from your gut or eaten in lower amounts. "These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Make note of the medications you're taking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a well-known fact that taking antibiotics &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732679/" target="_self"&gt;disrupts, at least temporarily, the family of "good" bacteria&lt;/a&gt; thriving in your body. Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/pdfs/aaw/au_arent_always_the_answer_fs_508.pdf" target="_self"&gt;common side effects&lt;/a&gt; of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the pH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; probiotics or supplements &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;seek a probiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/how-do-probiotics-improve-your-gut-health/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mimic an intact microbiota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and "each strain has its own method of action." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking them for bowel regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever it is your problem is," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unfortunately, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you," Cresci said. "You have to do the other part too." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;piotr_malczyk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Move your body every day and prioritize sleep &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get better sleep" or "exercise more" might sound like tired advice, but improving your sleep hygiene and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;squeezing in more physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are tried and true ways to improve your health, including your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise may &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;help your gut in different ways&lt;/a&gt;, including by improving your circulation, helping your metabolism and aiding your digestive muscles, according to the Cleveland Clinic. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/exercise-snacks-are-just-as-healthy-as-a-full-workout-heres-why/" target="_self"&gt;small ways&lt;/a&gt; you can get your body in the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;habit of moving every day&lt;/a&gt; or at least more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, too. So, if we eat when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to process the nutrients of our food properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking sleep also triggers an increase in stress and cortisol, which have &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative mental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and physical impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot going on with the gut-brain interaction, so that signals back to the microbiome, and vice versa," Cresci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.637010/full#h11" target="_self"&gt;including exercising&lt;/a&gt; or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which impact our gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're sleepy, tired, exhausted, you tend not to do the things we know are good for microbiomes," Cresci said. "So it kind of perpetuates itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 07:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNVWxmSkcya1hlSnAweFZwQ2JUZ2VtSEZqZnpKQVpfckVoVkNfYWIyWDY0VzhUMHlsM1RvSjRJNTIwRWZkbUpDRms4OUMtbFNHcy1ramowWkkzRVA2Y0o4NjVheHE5WHExNzFycGRFVmhDUUlNQ3JVSHhhRGhEM0NJTjRNeEZvc1FScTdQRmQ0WXBIUGttcnc0end2XzNoQVEzb1lWa21FY3VVRWVVdUJSZXFsZGVpWkxyT2c</guid></item><item><title>美国心脏协会的新血压指南：关键要点-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;Fatty liver disease: Warning signs one s...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;5 human body parts we may no longer need...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 06:24:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>通过这三种核心稳定机芯--Fit&amp;Well--建立更好的平衡</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxQM2twRVNleTVnRlp2WnE4TnN4MFFHWUNNYm9jYldlckFNcTg0bExzQkhqQ3EwelVOSXE4WlhNcFh3YXM2ZU9WeUdQNC1EbjRZUUxFZkZNdjBrVlpqcERONmRLbnY0SDJBQjk1c2t1bFlQNTZwSk1yX19INzJHdWJCN1pLWDBUMXp2Sy1FeTg3ZWJyZEhhZEd2dnhGY0NrQTVpd2dlX0V6cFQ0X2gwbHZuNDBlUkU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p id="dc1e2997-a168-4d53-8a7f-c39d80fd6b51"&gt;Good core stability is important for everyday movements. You use your core muscles to keep you upright when sitting or standing, when walking or running and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core strength is important for core stability, but a strong core isn’t necessarily a stable one.

It is among the most common cancers in the UK and globally, impacting thousands of lives each year. While digestive symptoms like changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, bloating, and unexplained weight loss are well known, colon cancer can also cause symptoms on the skin, though these are relatively rare. Skin signs such as nodules, rashes, ulcers, or noticeable changes in pigmentation may indicate the cancer has spread, is progressing, or has reached advanced stages. Recognising these unusual skin symptoms early can be crucial for timely diagnosis, medical intervention, and effective treatment, significantly improving outcomes and survival rates for those affected by this serious disease.

These lesions can vary in colour, often reddish, purple, or skin-toned, and may appear anywhere but are frequently found on the abdomen, chest, or around surgical scars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2.

This can be due to paraneoplastic syndromes, where the immune system reacts abnormally to the presence of cancer. These skin changes may appear before other symptoms, signaling underlying malignancy, and should prompt timely evaluation, especially when accompanied by unexplained weight loss or fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3.

These can become sites of secondary infection, causing pain, discomfort, swelling, foul odor, and increased risk of systemic infection, necessitating prompt medical evaluation and appropriate wound care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4.

Meanwhile, the vast majority never flapped down from the attic into living spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-50c0eb" class="body-graf"&gt;Health officials thus deemed it better safe than sorry to alert everybody who has stayed in the cabins recently that they might have been exposed by being bitten or scratched. Especially when people are sleeping, a bat bite or scratch can go unseen and unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6cb696" class="body-graf"&gt;“What we’re really concerned about is people who saw bats in their rooms and people who might have had direct contact with a bat,” Harrist said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd4d1e" class="body-graf"&gt;The cabins have been unoccupied, with no plans to reopen, since concessionaire Grand Teton Lodge Company discovered the bat problem July 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e8741" class="body-graf"&gt;Bats are a frequent vector of the rabies virus. Once symptoms occur — muscle aches, vomiting, itching, to name a few — rabies is almost always fatal in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f35dbf" class="body-graf"&gt;The good news is a five-shot prophylactic regimen over a two-week period soon after exposure is highly effective in preventing illness, Harrist noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9af68e" class="body-graf"&gt;The cabins opened for the summer season in May after being vacant over the winter. Based on the roughly 250 reservations through late July, health officials estimated that up to 500 people had stayed in the cabins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b32043" class="body-graf"&gt;They were trying to reach people in 38 states and seven countries through those states’ health agencies and, in the case of foreign visitors, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-04aeec" class="body-graf"&gt;Others who have not been alerted yet but stayed in cabins 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, 528 and 530 this year should tell health officials or a doctor immediately, Harrist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e4724" class="body-graf"&gt;Health officials were recommending prophylactic shots for people who fit certain criteria, such as deep sleepers who found a bat in their room, and children too young to say that they had seen a bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c0449" class="body-graf"&gt;The Wyoming Department of Health had no ongoing concern about visitor safety at the Jackson Lake Lodge area. That includes a Federal Reserve economic policy symposium Aug. 21-23 that takes place at Jackson Lake Lodge every summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4346b7" class="body-graf"&gt;“The lodge company has done a fantastic job of doing their due diligence of making sure everyone that is coming in for that, and for all other visits this year, are going to be as safe as possible,” said Emily Curren, Wyoming’s public health veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-940b4b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Three or four” dead bats from the cabins tested negative and one that was mangled did not have enough brain tissue to be testable, Curren said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-921e9e" class="body-graf"&gt;All were brown bats, which come in two species: “little” and “big,” with the larger ones more than twice as big. Officials were unsure which species these were, but both are common in Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1ad8b5" class="body-graf"&gt;They typically live in colonies of 30 to 100 individuals, Curren said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f9b24d" class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s a lot of bats that we cannot rule out a risk of rabies being in,” Curren said. “There’s no way for us to know for certain about every single bat that got into these rooms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3be319" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;There are no plans to exterminate the bats, Grand Teton National Park spokesperson Emily Davis said. Devices fitted to the building were keeping the bats from getting back in after flying out in pursuit of insects to eat, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 00:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOejBUamxES0NBUS1jWE0yQTgwZ2hPUGZST2thTDQ2RWlXaWZ5VWtYWkhJY0RWWldFUjVBN1h1bENJeWdmSFBTY29VWnRTVkpoNjVQV3p3MFVMS2E0NGNMM1NvXzJsbWxhN3VLRkY1ZXdQQm9wUGhMdkstdGkzVExCRjFLMmw5X0NoRlBVNW9rNlR6NzR4eWdVRGRDTnVQTUVzUXBIN3Y3UmZSRFhhSzlQTHprOVZ2X3doSHfSAVZBVV95cUxOdFc4LTRqQ3VkTDdUemNiZE5Uc0tzVlRwaTZsN2pkdFREV0twOFFBQnotRG50ZmVBOUVtWGVCS0l2bDRabHJxOFE4NHhmWXFzdjFxV2hNZw</guid></item><item><title>纽约有3名婴儿死于先天性梅毒：这是什么？ - WCBD</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content article-body rich-text "&gt;
		
		


&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NewsNation&lt;/a&gt;) — So far this year, at least three infant deaths associated with &lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/syphilis-in-newborns-why-is-it-happening/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/syphilis-in-newborns-why-is-it-happening/"&gt;congenital syphilis&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in New York state, as the number of reported cases continues to increase nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 12, the New York State &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-08-12_testing_for_syphilis.htm" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-08-12_testing_for_syphilis.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; issued a release urging parents to get tested. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No baby should die from syphilis in New York State or anywhere in this country; it is completely preventable,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="tsoswq6k" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is congenital syphilis?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection that can result in serious health complications when left untreated, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_causes_risk_spread-how-it-spreads" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_causes_risk_spread-how-it-spreads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="tsoswq6k" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The infection develops in stages and can be spread through contact with a syphilis sore during unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex. It can also be transmitted through casual contact with everyday objects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Congenital syphilis occurs when syphilis is passed from a person infected with syphilis to their child during pregnancy or birth, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/about-congenital-syphilis.html#cdc_disease_basics_causes_risk_spread-how-it-spreads" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/about-congenital-syphilis.html#cdc_disease_basics_causes_risk_spread-how-it-spreads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Congenital syphilis can result in miscarriage, stillbirth and death shortly after birth. If the baby survives, they may also be premature and develop serious health issues, including deformed bones, severe anemia and brain and nerve problems, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Not all parents with syphilis will pass it on to their offspring, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/congenital-syphilis" data-type="link" data-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/congenital-syphilis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is it treatable?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is imperative to treat congenital syphilis immediately upon diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment of congenital syphilis can occur while the parent is pregnant or right after birth with penicillin. However, a nationwide penicillin shortage is contributing to concern related to the rising numbers, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/from-the-director/2025-07-bicillin-recall.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/from-the-director/2025-07-bicillin-recall.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“Detecting syphilis early in pregnancy with a simple blood test is important to ensure rapid diagnosis and treatment, so you have a healthy baby,” McDonald said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of May 2024, New York state requires that all pregnant people undergo a syphilis test at least three times during pregnancy, including at the time of first examination, during the third trimester and at delivery, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/congenital_syphilis/providers/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/congenital_syphilis/providers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New York State Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A growing problem nationally&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2023, there were 209,253 cases of syphilis nationwide, the highest total since 1950, per &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;During a recent 10-year stretch, the number of congenital syphilis cases shot up over 1,000%, from 334 cases reported in 2012 to 3,761 in 2022, per &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7246e1.htm?s_cid=mm7246e1_w" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7246e1.htm?s_cid=mm7246e1_w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;

"In fact, many patients return for follow-up visits post-mango season, often with elevated glucose levels, and sometimes, the culprit may just be overindulgence in this beloved fruit," says Dr Baxi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This constant dilemma has left many people with diabetes wary of the "king of fruits". Yet, new research suggests that mangoes might not be the villain they're sometimes made out to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Two new Indian clinical trials are turning conventional dietary wisdom on its head, suggesting that controlled mango consumption instead of carbohydrates (in the form of bread) may actually improve blood sugar and metabolic health in people with &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zfc3pg8/revision/4" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, while in type 2, the body becomes resistant to insulin's effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Type 2 diabetes makes up over 90% of global cases, according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). It's the eighth leading cause of disease burden worldwide, projected to rank second by 2050. Though not fully understood, it's strongly linked to excess weight, age, ethnicity and family history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In India, an estimated 77 million adults have type 2 diabetes, while nearly 25 million are prediabetic and at high risk of developing the condition, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/india/diabetes" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d01a/live/62bbd980-7845-11f0-a20f-3b86f375586a.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Hindustan Times via Getty Images People look at mangoes during a festival of mangoes with different varieties of fruits on a table in India." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Hindustan Times via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Mango festivals pop up across Indian cities, celebrating the fruit's cultural significance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet amidst the challenges, new findings offer a surprising ray of hope - especially for mango lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A pilot study soon to appear in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition and involving 95 participants found that three popular Indian mango varities - Safeda, Dasheri and Langra - produced similar or lower glycemic responses than white bread over two hours of glucose testing. (A glycemic response is how quickly and how much a food raises blood sugar levels after eating.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Continuous glucose monitoring of people with and without type 2 diabetics over three days showed that, in participants with diabetes, post-meal sugar fluctuations were significantly smaller after eating a mango. This low fluctuation glycemic response could be beneficial to the body in the long run, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Mangoes are a much-loved fruit and maligned for its possible glucose and weight-elevating effects," said Dr Sugandha Kehar, first author of both studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"These studies show that within prescribed diets, consumption of mangoes are not detrimental to blood glucose and may even be beneficial,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A second, eight-week randomised trial published in the Journal of Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolic Disorders - conducted at Delhi's Fortis C-DOC with Indian Council of Medical Research funding - has reinforced the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Thirty-five adults with type 2 diabetes who replaced their breakfast bread with 250g of mango saw improvements in fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1C test (HbA1c) which measures average blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, weight, waist circumference and HDL cholesterol. These markers are key indicators of diabetes control and overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We showed the benefits of small doses of mangoes in place of carbohydrates (bread) in breakfast in two detailed studies for the first time, laying to rest all speculations regarding adverse metabolic effects of its consumption," says Prof Anoop Misra, senior author and study lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But the key is moderation and clinical supervision - this is not a licence for unlimited mango feasts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b1/live/d58013f0-78e5-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Bloomberg via Getty Images A health worker conducts a blood glucose test for a patient while during a free door-to-door screening programme." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;An estimated 77 million adults in India have type 2 diabetes&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;I asked Prof Misra what eating mangoes in moderation meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If your daily limit is 1,600 calories, any calories from mango should be part of that total, not extra.

Pair them with protein or fibre, and avoid combining with other carbs or sugary forms, such as juices and milkshakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Beyond its metabolic impact, the mango occupies a far larger place in Indian life - a fruit that opens doors both literally and figuratively, carrying cultural, social and even diplomatic significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Mango diplomacy" is a familiar phrase across the subcontinent, where carefully chosen crates of the fruit can grease political deals, strengthen alliances or smooth over tense negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="AFP via Getty Images  Indian Ambassador Ronen Sen (L) hands a basket of Indian mangoes to US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns at a ceremony celebrating the opening of mango trade between the United States and India at the Commerce Department in Washington 01 May 2007.

The fruit is, at once, a favourite indulgence and a quietly powerful social currency. "Most Indians have a personal favourite mango and parochial regional loyalties have long fuelled heated ranking debates," says Pushpesh Pant, a Delhi-based historian and culinary expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Good mangoes are not just to be eaten; they are adornments like jewellery. The rules of the mango push the best produce towards those willing to pay the highest price," writes Sopan Joshi in Mangifera indica: A Biography of the Mango, a magisterial account of the fruit and its admirers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There are more than 1,000 varieties of mango grown in India. Joshi writes India's mangoes vary by region: northern and eastern varieties like Langra, Dasheri, Chausa and Himsagar are intensely sweet, while southern types offer a subtle sweet-sour flavour. The Alphonso of western India owes its signature taste to a unique balance of sugar and acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So central is the fruit to Indian life that the calendar year itself often begins with the mango flowering. Poet Ghalib called the mango a "a sealed glass of honey", and hundreds of books have been written celebrating its allure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Part indulgence, part icon, the mango continues to delight and inspire - now with a surprising nod from science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 00:28:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9xTldBemF1bnRsTG1TeU9ibmsyNGFJWEZZSEh4NHZ2eWRBQ3M1NXJpNEFFV1JrRmNNN0FJMndzNG5ZSnIxNUFobmF2Ym0tdWZJRWhlSFc2SnVTd9IBX0FVX3lxTE9iQV9BZVc1N3JTMnF3LV9mSXBtM0NmMy1ralF3c2Zsa0IwMzBmRnV2cWJxYjJpWExuRkpQZ0dCZVRkLV96S1p3QW85azRBa2MyTFlieGF6b0wtOWpLRExJ</guid></item><item><title>整个加利福尼亚州的山谷热正在上升。旧金山纪事报（ San Francisco Chronicle ）的一个沿海县的人数正在飙升</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOcm1vZzdfNF9lcGVZNjlGNDJESGtwQ1dfV1BJZm4xUUN1cFZ3TDJxOVFnUGFZRV8xUjhITVRVUHNmaG94UVJQcE9PZmJWLURDTFNua1FtYXdJOU0xTk9sQ2d4RGlKQUIzSEhTQ1VfY0Zkc2ZCdHBpYU55bklaam5Lb2N0SUxUQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmlands in Contra Costa County in August 2023.

By comparison, the state logged 7,000 to 9,000 cases per year from 2017 through 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever can occur any time of year, but infections typically happen in late summer and fall. The disease is caused by the fungus coccidioides, which grows in the soil in parts of California. Wet winters help the fungus grow while dry, windy weather during warmer months helps airborne spread of spores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living in areas with high rates of valley fever face higher risk of infection, especially if they live or work near where dirt is stirred up, like farms and construction sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where valley fever is common, experts &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverPrevention.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; people stay inside and keep windows and doors closed when it’s windy and dusty outside.

So it’s no surprise that they’re cross-referencing both the historical incidence of COVID and what we’re seeing in wastewater to say it’s pretty likely that this many people probably have COVID right now, or may likely get COVID right now, because this many people are shedding the virus,” added Malaty Rivera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Malaty Rivera said that wastewater data is only accurate to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t always say that the presence of virus [in wastewater] is infectious virus,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater data can’t distinguish between active virus and non-infectious virus fragments from someone who was infected months ago, Malaty Rivera explained. (Just like how, early in the COVID pandemic, PCR tests could come back &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7417974/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="positive for months" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689f52eae4b0fd906c861815" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7417974/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;positive for months&lt;/a&gt; after someone recovered from a COVID-19 infection, she noted).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so the presence of COVID-19 [in wastewater] is not necessarily the presence of active virus. It could be a virus from people who were sick weeks ago or months ago who are still shedding virus, but it’s not an infectious virus,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in a COVID surge right now and we should expect another bump as kids head back to school in September and as folks return from summer vacations, said Malaty Rivera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fall, back to school, return from vacation, has always historically shown an uptick in respiratory illnesses, and COVID is not exclusive to that. COVID is now part of our annual cadence,” she said. “And so the summer surge is no surprise, and to expect another bump is also completely based on evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;We're currently in a summer COVID wave, and some experts say COVID infections could peak in early September.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick during the summer COVID wave, here’s what you should do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get infected with COVID, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the CDC’s recommendations say" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689f52eae4b0fd906c861815" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;the CDC’s recommendations say&lt;/a&gt; you should stay home when you’re sick and isolate from other people in your home.

What’s “resolving” for one person could mean being very sick for another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And no fever... fever is not the only indicator... for infectiousness to others,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on the evidence, if you are testing positive on a rapid antigen test, that means that you are likely infectious to others. If you are infectious to others, that means you should be isolating from other people and wearing a mask in indoor settings if you’re forced to be in indoor settings with other people,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need fresh air, it’s OK to go outside without a mask, but you shouldn’t be close to other people, said Malaty Rivera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think people should be unmasked in places with other people unless they are testing negative on an antigen test,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are sick, you can also check with your doctor to see if you’re eligible for Paxlovid, which is an anti-viral COVID medication, Malaty Rivera said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are things you can do to prevent a COVID infection, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you didn’t get an updated COVID vaccine in the past year, it might be a good time to get one, especially before any changes in eligibility come into effect,” said Dowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are over 65 or immunocompromised, you’re eligible for another COVID shot, she added, so long as you’re&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s1023-covid-19-vaccine.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" six months out from your last dose" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689f52eae4b0fd906c861815" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s1023-covid-19-vaccine.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt; six months out from your last dose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But, besides protection from vaccines, when there is more COVID around, it’s a good time to ramp up our trusty precautions that work for most respiratory viruses,” Dowd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This includes paying attention to ventilation when socializing (such as being outside or opening doors and windows [and] using HEPA filters), staying home when sick and masking strategically in higher-risk situations like airplane travel or other crowded places,” noted Dowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

      &lt;p&gt;The first human case of West Nile virus this season has been confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit (WECHU) says one person has tested positive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Nile is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito and residents are urged to take precautions such as wearing bug spray, removing standing water from their property, wearing long sleeves and pants and reducing time outdoors during dusk and dawn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is important for everyone to eliminate any standing water around their property and take personal protective measures to avoid mosquito bites even as we approach the cooler fall months", said Dr. Aloosh, Medical Officer of Health, Windsor-Essex County Health Unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WECHU says symptoms usually start to show within 2-14 days after a bite and can include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, body aches, skin rash and swollen lymph glands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People over the age of 50 and those with weakened immune systems are at higher risk for severe disease. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/template&gt;

However, she ended up being diagnosed with stage 3 cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Everybody was telling me I’m going through perimenopause,” she told &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/mom-reveals-cervical-cancer-sign-dismissed-rcna221912" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Today.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Today.com&lt;/a&gt;, adding, “I didn’t make a big deal about it. I just put up with it for another two months. But then I started getting contractions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders, who works as a flagger, told the outlet, “My mom was like, ‘Melissa, all of us go through it.' "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I was like, ‘I don’t know mom because when you were going through this, I don’t remember you being in this much pain.’ And then I was like, ‘There is no way this is just perimenopause,’ ” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A stock photo of a nurse testing for cervical cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms of perimenopause, which "is the time before menopause when your body is getting ready to stop having periods," can include your periods being longer or shorter, as well as hot flashes, trouble sleeping and vaginal dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After multiple months of non-stop, heavy bleeding, Sanders recalled experiencing contraction-like pains, which led to her making an appointment to get a &lt;a href="https://people.com/cervical-cancer-screening-hpv-pap-smear-8759164" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pap smear;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pap smear&lt;/a&gt; in March 2024, per the outlet. It had been 22 years since she had last had one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I never worried about me,” Sanders told the outlet. “I was a single mom with three kids, and I worked. So, they did their routines, doctors, dentists, but I just never had the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders' doctor scheduled a biopsy after her pap smear; however, they stopped performing it "within two minutes of starting it," Sanders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I had cancerous skin falling off my cervix, just falling off, and there was ooze," she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders said her doctor could tell she had a mass by feeling it, before a further MRI and PET scan confirmed she had stage 3 cervical cancer. She underwent chemotherapy and radiation for six months, Today.com reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders admitted that during that time, she felt "really, really weak," adding to the outlet, “My son pretty much had to carry (me) around at my last radiation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders finished the treatments, which ended up putting her in menopause, in September 2024, and her scans have been clear since last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite not being able to stand as long as she was able to before, and feeling like she needs to "gain all" her "muscles back," Sanders is hopeful for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I got to put me first,” she told the outlet. “I try to do everything healthier. I just walked three miles the other day with my daughter and grandbaby.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She insisted she wants to start putting her heath first, so she can see her granddaughter, Gracelynn, grow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sanders recalled of the cancer diagnosis, “I was sad. But I didn’t give up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A lot of people have that mindset that life is too busy. But it really isn’t,” she insisted, urging others to get their checks done. “It’s very important to keep up with your pap smears, mammograms.

Most of them were unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e16186" class="body-graf"&gt;That's why some doctors are hoping that the first nasal flu vaccine available for use at home can improve vaccination rates among people, especially children, who are afraid of needles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2af093" class="body-graf"&gt;AstraZeneca's FluMist Home, which was approved last fall, is now available with a prescription for children ages 2 and over, and adults up to age 49.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32cf81" class="body-graf"&gt;A 2019 review from researchers at the University of Michigan found the majority of children and up to 30% of young adults are &lt;a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/147205/jan13818.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;afraid of needles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e6326" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Zachary Hoy, board-certified pediatric infectious disease specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee, said many children are scared because they aren't old enough to understand what vaccines are and why they are important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8da693" class="body-graf"&gt;“Most of the time, the anxiety and worry before the shot is scarier than the actual shot,” Hoy said.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-df85f1"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1667" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg" alt="FluMist Home is only available online.

However, after the &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html" target="_blank"&gt;2009 swine flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt; introduced the new H1N1 strain, several studies found the nasal spray was less effective than other flu vaccines. This prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flumist-nose-spray-vaccine-doesn-t-work-experts-say-n597411" target="_blank"&gt;recommend against using the nasal spray in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the CDC said the nasal spray accounted for &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2016/s0622-laiv-flu.html" target="_blank"&gt;one-third of all flu vaccines &lt;/a&gt;given to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f075ed" class="body-graf"&gt;In response, FluMist’s manufacturers reformulated it to more closely match circulating strains, including H1N1, and the nasal spray returned in 2018. Like injectable flu vaccines, FluMist is updated each season based on recommendations from global health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41bf7f" class="body-graf"&gt;“FluMist’s efficacy is comparable to injectable flu vaccines and is a safe and effective needle-free option for flu protection,” AstraZeneca spokesperson Andrew Leone said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e7bcca" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts say it’s too early to tell how bad the upcoming flu season will be.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59fbe1" class="body-graf"&gt;Typically, flu vaccines are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/php/effectiveness-studies/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;40% and 60% effective&lt;/a&gt; in preventing severe illness, and FluMist Home should be equally protective. The doses for the 2026-2027 season contain three virus strains: an A/H1N1 strain, an A/H3N2 strain and a B strain from the B/Victoria lineage, according to the drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-452946" class="body-graf"&gt;The FluMist Home vaccine contains a weakened form of a live virus to stimulate the immune system. Pregnant women or people with compromised immune systems are advised to talk with their doctor before using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-9064fb" class="body-heading"&gt;Does insurance cover it? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59db30" class="body-graf"&gt;FluMist Home is available only online. People ordering the nasal spray will need to complete a medical screening questionnaire at &lt;a href="https://www.flumist.com/" target="_blank"&gt;FluMist.com&lt;/a&gt; that is reviewed by a health care professional, according to the drugmaker. FluMist Home’s online pharmacy will then collect the insurance information and bill the health plan directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b34b7" class="body-graf"&gt;A temperature monitor on the packaging will verify that the vaccine has been maintained at the appropriate temperature during shipping and delivery. Green means it's safe to use. Red means it's not.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-283a97" class="body-graf"&gt;Christina Aungst, senior pharmacy editor at GoodRx, estimates people with insurance will likely only have to pay an $8.99 shipping fee for the nasal spray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40d601" class="body-graf"&gt;“Currently, if you don’t have insurance, FluMist is only available in a health care setting,” AstraZeneca's Leone said. “We hope to provide a cash pay option for FluMist Home in future seasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-be6052" class="body-graf"&gt;When FluMist is given in a health care office or clinic, most insurance plans — including &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/insurance/medicare/does-medicare-cover-flu-shots" target="_blank"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/vaccines/medicaid-vaccine-coverage" target="_blank"&gt;Medicaid&lt;/a&gt; — will cover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3496b8" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale School of Medicine, worries people may not administer the nasal spray vaccine properly without a doctor's supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c35fb" class="body-graf"&gt;“What if they have a runny nose?

The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists’ knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But she said that it’s not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don’t harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits’ immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 19:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPc3FsYzVqdEJhT2E0em1aTEFXYm5MbDZWdkpZRUpFLUhxbFNCSHlzMkp2RlQ0TzBQcVpqek9BMUFFdllUbzBhTWJzNk1uVjJmQUh1R2E0Y3ZDaEFZTGhpYnIxVTlJS2Y3d1FyQUV0VXVmbWx3MUYxM3NXZFdRNzhvd25ZbXBMb1N5NW9WRFlGWklGNVFnRnd1eEFUbERhdk02bC1LaGxLSkF5aHU3MXczYjFZdm8tNG41</guid></item><item><title>在华盛顿州发现不寻常的“僵尸兔子” - KIRO 7 News西雅图</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="default__ArticleBody-sc-tl066j-1 jPcFTl article-body-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gdrPeS body-paragraph"&gt;Unusual-looking rabbits have recently been spotted in Washington, sporting wart-like growths that can resemble horns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gdrPeS body-paragraph"&gt;Wildlife officials say the animals are infected with Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common rabbit virus that is harmless to humans and pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gdrPeS body-paragraph"&gt;The virus, first identified in the 1930s by Dr. Richard E.

            Health officials in New York City say a cluster of Legionnaires’ disease in Central Harlem has grown to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fsite%2Fdoh%2Fhealth%2Fhealth-topics%2Flegionnaires-disease.page&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CAmanda.Sealy%40cnn.com%7C8ee77209fc3646fca65708dddbff5e5a%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638908612143625370%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=BFfVpeWuCjffe2%2B5W%2B%2F%2F0OZDo86Iq8C35QLlPbHeaLE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;99 cases, including four deaths&lt;/a&gt;.

            Health officials suspect the bacteria that causes the disease, Legionella, originated cooling towers — devices that uses water to cool large buildings and then disperse mist into the air. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn’t properly disinfected, Legionella can grow and sicken people who inhale the mist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Department of Health says 11 of the 12 cooling towers have already been repaired and the final tower should be remediated by Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed0unzu00073b6oh1h9ib2b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health officials emphasized that plumbing systems are separate from cooling tower systems in affected buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed0unzu00083b6o11jftlw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This community outbreak is not related to a building’s hot or cold water supply. Residents in these ZIP codes can continue to drink water, bathe, shower, cook, and use their air conditioner,” it said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed769e500003b6qc3mzqvdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current Legionnaires’ cluster was first announced on July 25. Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said inspectors are working with building owners to ensure compliance with testing and remediation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed7gqm500043b6qqrcamh34@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The good news is that new cases have begun to decline, which indicates that the sources of the bacteria have been contained,” Morse said. “New Yorkers who live or work in the identified ZIP codes and have flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible for timely diagnosis and treatment for the best chance at a good outcome.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed0unzu00093b6on1retlm1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. It is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can lead to shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10% of people who contract the disease die from complications, with older adults and people with weakened immune systems at higher risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Health officials suspect the bacteria that causes the disease, Legionella, originated cooling towers — devices that uses water to cool large buildings and then disperse mist into the air. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn’t properly disinfected, Legionella can grow and sicken people who inhale the mist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Department of Health says 11 of the 12 cooling towers have already been repaired and the final tower should be remediated by Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Health officials emphasized that plumbing systems are separate from cooling tower systems in affected buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This community outbreak is not related to a building’s hot or cold water supply. Residents in these ZIP codes can continue to drink water, bathe, shower, cook, and use their air conditioner,” it said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The current Legionnaires’ cluster was first announced on July 25. Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said inspectors are working with building owners to ensure compliance with testing and remediation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The good news is that new cases have begun to decline, which indicates that the sources of the bacteria have been contained,” Morse said. “New Yorkers who live or work in the identified ZIP codes and have flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible for timely diagnosis and treatment for the best chance at a good outcome.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. It is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can lead to shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10% of people who contract the disease die from complications, with older adults and people with weakened immune systems at higher risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Some people do this quickly by starting with a "loading" phase of 20 grams per day for a week and then lowering to 5 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Loading isn't necessary though, Professor Cooke said, because you get the same results by starting at 5 grams per day, it will just take a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;For most people it will result in more power and strength for explosive bursts of exercise and it improves recovery after exercise-related muscle damage as well as sarcopenia (loss of muscle as we age) if taken in conjunction with resistance training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Recently, researchers started delving deeper into the potential benefits of creatine among women and

which may negatively impact creatine metabolism so supplementation could be beneficial at this time, Professor Cooke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Research has shown creatine supplementation can help post-menopausal women with physical function when combined with resistance training and now experts want to explore how it might support bone health during perimenopause when bone density starts to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;It's early days but research is also suggesting supplementation may benefit pre-menopausal women during their menstrual cycles when there's varying levels of creatine metabolism and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Some brands are now shamelessly trying to capture the female market by using taglines like "craft your perfect peach" or advertising "creatine for women" when it’s exactly the same as the "genderless" creatine on the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;"Some of them claim, 'this is better absorbed than creatine monohydrate' but monohydrate is 99.9 per cent absorbed so you're not going to get any better

                The study looked at records for more than 250,000 emergency department visits by children who are on Medicaid.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Children who go to emergency departments in a mental health crisis and need to be hospitalized often end up stuck there for days, a new study finds. That happens in roughly one in ten of all mental health emergency visits for children enrolled in Medicaid across the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The most common mental health crises that led to such extended stays, or boarding, were depressive disorders and suicidal thoughts and attempts, according to the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2837523" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study published in JAMA Health Forum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"So a child shows up at an emergency department with a mental health condition, [and] about one in ten times, they're staying for three days or longer," says lead study author &lt;a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/people/kjohn-mcconnell-phd-ms-ma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;John McConnell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Health Systems Effectiveness at Oregon Health and Science University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McConnell and his colleagues also found that in a handful of states, including North Carolina, Florida and Maine, as many as 25% of mental health visits led to kids boarding at the emergency department for 3-7 days.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings aren't surprising, says &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1205956968/jennifer-havens" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Jennifer Havens&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But having data like this is very important to see the effect across the country," she adds. Havens was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Boarding in the emergency department has been a growing issue across the nation for decades, but the rise has been particularly dramatic in recent years for pediatric mental health cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As the children's behavioral health crisis nationwide has increased, states have not been able to keep up with behavioral health systems," says &lt;a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/rebecca-marshall-md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Rebecca Marshall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at OHSU, who also wasn't involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Though the study looked only at Medicaid claims, the problem happens for children on private health insurance, as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We really have struggled to build capacity over time to increase the number of inpatient beds," she says. "And so often what happens is kids will come into the hospital, they need an inpatient psychiatric bed and there isn't one available. So then they wait until a child in one of the psychiatric units discharges and a bed becomes available."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many states have a shockingly low number of psychiatric beds for kids, says Marshall. For example, Oregon has only 38 beds for highest need pediatric psychiatric cases. "And then we have less than 200 residential beds, and that's a lower acuity treatment program that tends to be longer term."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"There's an enormous problem across the country with a lack of access to mental health services, both on the [inpatient and] outpatient side," says Havens. Adequate outpatient services can prevent kids with mental health conditions from reaching a crisis point.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without adequate outpatient and inpatient mental health care options, families are more likely to take their child to an ER if the child is in a mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But "what they find when they go to the emergency department is that there often isn't any available care," says Marshall. "There's nothing immediate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most ERs don't even have a child and adolescent psychiatrist, says Havens, "because we've just never invested in the resources to have this kind of service for kids."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And when children in mental health crises end up stuck in ERs for days, their symptoms can worsen even if there's a psychiatrist on staff.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of these children boarding in an ER end up stuck in "one small room," says Marshall, sometimes a windowless room. "They're not able to leave the room. They can't exercise. They're not able to interact with other kids, which is a really important part of development. And often there are not any kind of additional therapeutic activities that you would find in an inpatient unit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure what the right words are, but, [it's] really challenging, heartbreaking situation for families that have a child and they're trying to kind of find a place to stabilize them, and they're stuck in the emergency department," says McConnell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;An elderly Sebastopol man has died after contracting &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/what-to-know-about-legionnaires-disease-which-has-sickened-dozens-in-new/" id="link-d52e038a557671b611e3f614cfae36c6" target="_self"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease&lt;/a&gt;, a serious form of pneumonia caused by the Legionella bacteria, Sonoma County health officials said Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County Interim Health Officer Karen Smith said the death is being investigated as a “sporadic case,” meaning it is considered an isolated incident, not an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said her team is in contact with the family of the man who died but is giving them time to grieve before seeking a more thorough account of the man’s last days. The incubation period for Legionella bacteria can be up to 14 days, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sonoma County, there have been three cases of Legionnaires’ pneumonia since the beginning of the year, she said, adding that none of them have been connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said Legionella is a very common environmental bacteria often found in “free water“ such as lakes and streams, as well as artificial water reservoirs such as cooling towers in large buildings, air conditioning systems, hot tubs and water heaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria thrives in warm water that’s a little bit stagnant, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the reasons no one tests wastewater for Legionella is because you’re going to find it there,” she said. “It’s a naturally occurring bacteria and the vast majority of people never get Legionella infections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastopol Interim City Manager Mary Gourley said the city does not test for the Legionella bacteria but keeps “a residual chlorine level ... that is 99% effective against” the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said there has to be a lot of the bacteria to cause an infection. But more importantly, she said, the people who tend to get sick from Legionella are older with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legionella spreads when small droplets of water containing the bacteria get into the air and people breathe them in. In very rare cases, someone breathes in Legionella while drinking water. Generally, people do not spread Legionnaires’ disease to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the disease are similar to other types of pneumonia, and include cough, muscle aches, fever, shortness of breath and headache. One in 10 individuals who contract Legionnaires’ disease will die from the infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said that more than 75% of people with Legionella are over 60, and many of them either have conditions like cancer that suppress the immune system or are on medications that suppress the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith declined to discuss the Sebastopol man’s health, saying only that he was “both older and he had a immunosuppressive condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sebastopol community is shocked by the death, with businesses and nonprofits mourning the man’s death on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks do occur, Smith said, &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/north-bay/cdc-report-finds-possible-source-for-deadly-2022-legionnaires-disease-outb/" id="link-3370f0e5c10da50c1e397ae1a2ab9cc6" target="_self"&gt;citing one in Napa County that involved multiple cases in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. That outbreak, in downtown Napa, killed one person and hospitalized 16 others. It was linked to a cooling tower at an unspecified facility, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7249a1.htm" id="link-d81f88079a3619799166687489c761d3" target="_self"&gt;according to a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak occurred from July to August 2022. The report linked some of the cases to a cooling tower, a structure that contains water and a fan used to cool buildings. A clogged pipe that led to the chemical feed system at the facility impeded the controller’s ability to detect water flow, resulting in low or no injection of biocide — or disinfectant — into the tower, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooling towers have been identified as the likely source of a current outbreak in Harlem, New York City, that has resulted in 99 cases and four deaths. New York City officials have identified 12 cooling towers in 10 buildings that have tested positive for the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said there is no indication or evidence that this infection is tied to a large community water source.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON – Guyana is the only Caribbean Community (Caricom) country that has a confirmed case of the Oropouche fever, a viral disease that has resurged across the Americas since late 2023, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest epidemiological update, PAHO said that so far this year, 12,786 confirmed cases have been reported across 11 countries — seven with local transmission and four with imported cases — reflecting the growing spread of this virus, primarily transmitted by the Culicoides paraensis midge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to PAHO, from January 1 to July 27, this year, Brazil has the highest confirmed cases with 11,888 cases, followed by Panama (501), Peru (330), Cuba (28), Colombia (26), five cases in Venezuela and one case in Guyana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO said imported cases have been reported in Uruguay, Chile, Canada and the United States. In 2024, the region recorded 16,239 cases across 11 countries and one territory, including four deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO said that Oropouche fever typically causes high fever, severe headaches, and muscle and joint pain, with most patients recovering in two to three weeks, though up to 60 per cent may experience relapses. In rare cases, it can lead to meningitis or encephalitis, and in pregnant women, there are concerns about potential fetal risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus’s spread to non-endemic areas is driven by factors like climate change, deforestation, and urbanisation of forested areas, which boost the midge population, it said, emphasising the need for stronger epidemiological surveillance and vector control to curb the disease, which currently has no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO said that the key PAHO recommendations to countries in the region include adapting actions based on the epidemiological situation in each country to detect the virus’s introduction into new areas, monitor its spread in areas with local transmission, and properly characterize the epidemiological landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said there is the need to eliminate midge breeding sites by clearing vegetation and promoting sustainable agricultural practices, prevent bites by using bed nets, protective clothing, and repellents containing DEET, IR3535, or icaridin, especially for pregnant women and rural workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, countries are being urged to strengthen early clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis, particularly with dengue and that treatment focuses on relieving pain and fever, ensuring hydration, and managing vomiting, while monitoring for neurological complications or issues in pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“PAHO stresses that national and regional collaboration is essential to monitor and control the spread of the virus, especially amid the circulation of other arboviruses like dengue. The organization is supporting countries with technical guidance on diagnosis, clinical management, and vector prevention and control, urging prompt reporting of unusual events, such as deaths or cases of vertical transmission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus was first detected in 1955 in a febrile forest worker in a village in Trinidad and Tobago called Vega de Oropouche, near the Oropouche River. Oropouche virus is endemic to the Amazon basin.&lt;/span&gt; - CMC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Pregnancy was easy for Stevee Fazenbaker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-291149" class="body-graf"&gt;“I felt good the whole time. I was considered low risk,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “My last scan was at 20 weeks and she was measuring perfectly and looked great.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e0e24" class="body-graf"&gt;During her remaining prenatal appointments, everything seemed as if it was going well and “there were no red flags,” Stevee Fazenbaker recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6f4417" class="body-graf"&gt;When Stevee Fazenbaker’s water broke, she went to the hospital, but labor didn’t progress as it should have. Doctors recommended  she undergo a cesarean section to deliver the baby, and Stevee Fazenbaker agreed. When Fletcher was born, the Fazenbakers knew she looked different than other newborns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c88abc" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a complete shock when she was born that anything was wrong,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “Our initial thought was, ‘OK, her head’s really big. Maybe it’s hydrocephalus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-401731" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hydroassoc.org/hydrocephalus-in-infants-and-children/" target="_blank"&gt;Hydrocephalus&lt;/a&gt; occurs when cerebral spinal fluid builds up in the brain, according to the Hydrocephalus Association. That can enlarge the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc69d8" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors took Fletcher to the neonatal intensive care unit to stabilize her, and the next day, she underwent an MRI, which revealed she had a brain tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c743a1" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was an extremely heavy time,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60cdd9" class="body-graf"&gt;After about a week, doctors said the family could take Fletcher home for hospice care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-547c36" class="body-graf"&gt;“They prepared us for a two-week life expectancy,” Billy Fazenbaker, 30, tells TODAY.com. “They told us initially she would decline immediately. The meds would go up and up, and up and she would pass in her sleep.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2aefe0" class="body-graf"&gt;The tumor rested near Fletcher’s brain stem, and doctors thought  the mass would encroach on it, which could eventually stop the infant’s breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3511f3" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a miracle in itself that we made it home,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “We came home and tried to live life with her.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0b32f" class="body-graf"&gt;The couple prioritized showing their daughter as much as possible in what they thought would be her short life. When it rained, they took Fletcher — hooked to oxygen and a feeding tube — outside so she could feel the rain. Even though doctors thought Fletcher would never be able to suck, her parents gave her a pacifier, which she sucked. So, they gave her a bottle, and she drank it. Fletcher did many things that doctors told the Fazenbakers she’d never do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-634830" class="body-graf"&gt;“(By the first week's) end, she’s already doing a couple (of) normal baby things, which was amazing,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-29cf51" class="body-graf"&gt;About a month passed, and then Fletcher and the family returned to the hospital to see if the baby could undergo another MRI or they could receive “some form of clarity that we were doing the right thing,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c76a95" class="body-graf"&gt;“They said, ‘Just soak up your time. Sometimes when they’re in a home environment, a loving environment, they can do well for a little bit a time. But there’s nothing we can do,’” Stevee Fazenbaker recalls. “They wouldn’t even place a shunt in her.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d34c73" class="body-graf"&gt;Her parents had hoped a shunt, a surgically implanted tube that helps to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, could reduce some of the pressure in Fletcher’s brain. Doctors didn’t believe the infant could survive the surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c05c52" class="body-graf"&gt;“She was alive, and we were loving it,” Billy Fazenbaker says. “But (we were) almost grieving her while she was alive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-08a962" class="body-graf"&gt;When Fletcher turned 2 months old, the Fazenbakers wanted a second opinion and contacted a “reputable” hospital for a consultation. They were devastated by that meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-474e84" class="body-graf"&gt;“The doctor was like, ‘Look, I don’t even think it’s worth you driving here after seeing her through Zoom. I agree with (the hospital) where you delivered opinion, and I think you should enjoy your time,’” Stevee Fazenbaker recalls. “His exact words were, ‘You wouldn’t be doing something for her. You would be doing something to her.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-7a6710"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1875"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg" alt="Doctors said their newborn would die within weeks.

They were “literally begging God for a walk-on-water miracle.” Soon after Fletcher turned 3 months old, their hospice nurse mentioned St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and asked if the couple had reached out to them. Immediately, they filled out an application for a second opinion. Forty-eight hours later, they received a call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb195a" class="body-graf"&gt;“She’s like, ‘So I think we can help you.’ How soon can you get here,’” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “(It) was the most exciting thing ever.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-417f1a" class="body-graf"&gt;The couple drove to Memphis and was stunned by what Dr. Aditi Bagchi told them when they met in November 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52ef52" class="body-graf"&gt;“She was like, ‘This is going to be a really bumpy road, but I think we can cure her,’” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “We went from hearing, ‘Go home on hospice and enjoy your time’ to ‘I think I can save your baby.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57eb25" class="body-graf"&gt;Bagchi believed that Fletcher had an infant-type hemispheric glioma, a tumor that she could treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-2c4f0c" class="body-heading"&gt;Infant-Type Hemispheric Gliomas &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11316d" class="body-graf"&gt;Until recently, doctors would sometimes see newborns, like Fletcher, with high-grade gliomas. Doctors thought that these brain tumors were the same as the aggressive brain tumor known as &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/men-s-health/glioblastoma-symptoms-migraine-rcna218836" target="_blank"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; that occurs in older children and adults. But clinical observations and ongoing research indicated that these gliomas found in infants behave differently. In 2021, doctors named them infant-type hemispheric gliomas to differentiate them from glioblastomas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a24e01" class="body-graf"&gt;“Research over the last decade or so has slowly given us hints that these tumors, which these little babies are getting, are different from the glioma that we see in older individuals,” Bagchi, a neuro-oncologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, tells TODAY.com. “It’s a relatively new … reclassification.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-76132a"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1406"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg" alt="Doctors said their newborn would die within weeks.

With new DNA and RNA sequencing methods, experts were able to confirm that the infant-grade hemispheric gliomas have “different genetic drivers” than glioblastomas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81d135" class="body-graf"&gt;“Their genome looks very different from the high-grade gliomas diagnosed in older children,” Bagchi explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-512f77" class="body-graf"&gt;As they are rare and newly classified, there’s a lack of awareness about infant-type hemispheric gliomas among doctors which could lead to delayed diagnosis, as in Fletcher’s case. It’s not uncommon for parents to hear the same devastating news the Fazenbakers did — that there is nothing doctors can do to help their infant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38fa6a" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you look at these babies and their MRIs, these tumors are huge and they are scary looking,” Bagchi says. “They are misdiagnosed a lot of times.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-591c9f" class="body-graf"&gt;Bagchi says it’s important to raise awareness of infant-type hemispheric gliomas so that doctors in community hospitals can direct these patients to children’s hospitals for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-883aeb" class="body-graf"&gt;“You don’t have to know how to cure it,” she says. “You just have to reach out to us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-80be59" class="body-graf"&gt;Signs of infant-type hemispheric gliomas often are not present until birth. Though prenatal scans can sometimes identify a blood clot in the brain or detect that the head is larger than usual. In some cases, babies are born with normal-sized heads, but they begin growing larger. In babies who are not diagnosed at birth, they can experience signs including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-00305d" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weakness on one side of the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-3ebecc" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not being able to eat or drink &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-65eacd" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bulging soft spot on the head&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c60b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Treatment depends on the “molecular characteristics” of the tumor found upon biopsy of the tumor. Some tumors have genetic markers that respond to targeted therapy, while chemotherapy treats tumors without those markers. When the tumor shrinks, doctors can remove the mass from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-37a4d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Delayed treatment can lead to developmental delays for many babies. But still, their tumors can be treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d32f2" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is life-saving for them to appropriately diagnose them and treat them,” Bagchi says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eedcf6" class="body-graf"&gt;In early 2026, Bagchi is launching a clinical trial to develop a standardized treatment protocol for infant-type hemispheric glioma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8ef846" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Just Incredible’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52c292" class="body-graf"&gt;When Fletcher met Bagchi, the infant’s head was the size of a 5-year-old’s. Immediately, doctors scheduled a surgery to place a shunt in Fletcher’s brain to drain some of the excess fluid and reduce some of the pressure. Since the skin on Fletcher’s skull was very thin from “her head expanding,” doctors worried about the shunt staying in place — yet it did. Recovering from surgery was still tough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b605b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a really bumpy road after that,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “She had sodium issues and really was unstable because she was draining so much fluid. Her head was changing so much, and her body was trying to adjust.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-2603bd"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1875"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg" alt="Doctors said their newborn would die within weeks.

The tumor’s size meant that Fletcher’s eyes angled downward so she couldn’t look at her parents. Almost immediately after the shunt was placed, she could see better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-319c1c" class="body-graf"&gt;“The day after she had the shunt (implanted) is one of our very favorite days,” Stevee Fazenbaker says while crying. “That was really the first time she ever looked at us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33faac" class="body-graf"&gt;By Christmas, Fletcher stabilized, and Bagchi performed a biopsy, which confirmed Fletcher had an infant-type hemispheric glioma. The tumor had the markers that made it responsive to targeted treatment, an oral medication her parents gave her through a small tube that extended from her nose to her esophagus. From January to March, she took the medication twice a day, and it “shrunk her tumor in half.” In March 2023, Fletcher underwent surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e98bb" class="body-graf"&gt;“They were able to completely remove her entire tumor, which was just incredible,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4b971d" class="body-graf"&gt;Fletcher continued taking the targeted medication for the next seven months. This upcoming October will mark two years since she finished treatment. Since then, Fletcher’s scans have been clear, and she’s been thriving. She does have some developmental delays and spends her days in various therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-93d25a" class="body-graf"&gt;“Finally, she has control, holding her head completely on her own,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “She’s sitting on her own with a little bit of support around her.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6329a" class="body-graf"&gt;Fletcher is a “very sweet, very, very happy girl,” who is sometimes “spicy,” especially when she’s over participating in therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f8359" class="body-graf"&gt;“She loves listening to music and stories. She loves being on the go,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “She loves being outside. She loves all weather. She loves it when it rains. She loves it when it’s windy. She loves when the sun’s on her face.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf1f83" class="body-graf"&gt;The family hopes Fletcher’s story encourages people to seek second opinions if their child is sick. They also want to raise awareness of infant-type hemispheric gliomas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-589cf1"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="2634"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-7-te-250815-cad1c0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-7-te-250815-cad1c0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-7-te-250815-cad1c0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-7-te-250815-cad1c0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-7-te-250815-cad1c0.jpg" alt="Doctors said their newborn would die within weeks.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TWIN FALLS COUNTY, Idaho — The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare confirmed the state's first West Nile virus-related death of 2025, involving a Twin Falls County person over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department said the death was due to West Nile virus encephalopathy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus can cause fever-related illness or brain and spinal cord infections, including meningitis or encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department announced the fatality on Friday and emphasized the need for people to protect themselves from mosquito bites. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt; spreads through bites from infected mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the virus has been detected in mosquitoes across seven southern Idaho counties and neighboring Malheur County, Oregon. However, it is important to note that not all counties collect and test mosquitoes for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We strongly encourage Idahoans to fight the bite of mosquitoes to protect themselves and their families," said Deputy State Epidemiologist Dr. Kathy Turner. "This tragic death from West Nile virus is a good reminder for all of us to take protective measures against mosquito bites."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the department, most people infected with the West Nile virus show no symptoms. Those infected develop fever along with symptoms including headache, body aches, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swollen lymph glands or rash.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe illness affects the brain and spinal cord in approximately one in 150 infected people, often requiring hospitalization. About 10% of those with severe West Nile virus die from the illness.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older adults and people with certain medical conditions face higher risks of severe illness. Recovery from serious cases may take weeks or months, with some effects potentially permanent.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department recommends avoiding mosquitoes, particularly between dusk and dawn when they are most active. Prevention measures include:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wearing loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants outdoors. Applying EPA-registered insect repellents to exposed skin, following label instructions carefully for children. Using clothing and gear treated with permethrin&lt;br&gt;Covering strollers and baby carriers with mosquito netting. Repairing or replacing damaged screens to insect-proof homes. Eliminating standing water on property by checking and draining outdoor containers. Changing water in bird baths, decorative ponds and animal tanks weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA provides a search tool for finding &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;appropriate repellents&lt;/a&gt;, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers an&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Insect Repellent Chatbot for guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who believes they may be sick from West Nile virus should consult their healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your wallet getting as thin as your hair thanks to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/13/lifestyle/from-rogaine-to-robots-trendiest-hacks-balding-men-using-to-get-their-hair-back/"&gt;pricey pills and potions&lt;/a&gt; promising to save your strands?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’re not alone. In the US, more than &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/most-men-experience-hair-loss-it-isnt-inevitable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;80% of men and nearly half of women&lt;/a&gt; will face significant hair loss in their lifetime, fueling a multi-billion-dollar industry selling quick fixes that don’t always work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before you empty your pockets, know this: There are a few simple everyday steps that one trichologist says can help protect your hair and keep it it looking fuller.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hair loss can lead to decreased self-esteem, anxiety and even depression in some people.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rido – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;William Gaunitz, a certified trichologist and founder of &lt;a href="https://www.advancedtrichology.com/pages/william-gaunitz-trichologist-hair-loss-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Advanced Trichology&lt;/a&gt;, shared five easy, effective ways to support scalp health and fight hair loss from home.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also gave The Post a heads-up about three popular hair hacks that could actually wind up doing more harm than good. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#1. Soak up some sunlight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Get out in the sun for 15 minutes with no sunscreen to get a balanced amount of vitamin D3,” Gaunitz advised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is essential for creating the cells that develop into hair follicles. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34553483/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; a deficiency may contribute to issues like excessive shedding and female pattern hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you’re staying out longer than 15 minutes, don’t forget the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/09/health/what-to-know-about-picking-sunscreen-including-2-key-ingredients/"&gt;SPF&lt;/a&gt; — even a small amount of time under a strong UV index without protection can lead to a sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Up to 40% of women will experience some degree of female pattern hair loss by age 50. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Nadya Kolobova – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#2. Eat a balanced diet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This one thing is more important than anything else,” Gaunitz stressed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don’t eat animal protein or follow another special diet, he warned there’s an “extremely high” chance you’ll drain your nutrient stores unless you carefully replace them with other sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Discover your blood type and eat accordingly,” Gaunitz recommended. “That is a great way to understand what your body needs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;William Gaunitz, a certified trichologist, has been working in the hair loss industry since 2002. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/williamgaunitztrichologist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#3. Check your gut health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have any consistent problems, like constipation, diarrhea or acid reflux, it is possible that your nutrient supply absorption may have been compromised,” Gaunitz said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means your body might not be absorbing nutrients properly even if you’re eating right — and those nutrient issues can impact your whole body, including your hair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#4 Don’t skip shampoo days&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wash your hair at a minimum of every 48 hours with a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-shampoos-for-every-hair-type-review/"&gt;healthy shampoo&lt;/a&gt; that has some type of antimicrobial oil in it, like grapefruit seed, rosemary, tea tree or thyme,” Gaunitz suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keeping microbial overload in check gently and consistently is key to managing your scalp’s delicate microbiome without damage, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies have shown that regular scalp massage can lead to reduced hair loss and increased hair thickness.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/mimada.beauty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#5 Massage your scalp daily&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before you hit the shower, try the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoG8iygEecc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;scalp-over-skull massage technique&lt;/a&gt;. It’s believed to boost blood flow to hair follicles, break up mild calcification under the scalp and help clear out excess sebum, an oily substance crucial for hair growth that can be harmful if it builds up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This can drastically improve scalp health,” Gaunitz said. “You can also use a gua sha tool and massage the scalp with the edge, which requires less effort but is still marginally effective.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What to ditch from your routine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some “hacks” are doing more harm than good. Gaunitz said to skip these three.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1. Dermarolling daily.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This handheld microneedling device may seem like a quick fix, but “dermarolling at home daily is a bad idea because it can create scarring and trauma on the scalp, little micro infections, and in many cases will actually make your scalp worse,” Gaunitz warned. “Like anything, it should be done properly by a professional.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;While it’s often used to stimulate growth, incorrect or excessive derma rolling can worsen hair loss. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Mishy Skincare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2. Skipping wash day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The number of times I’ve heard somebody say that they were told by their stylist that they saw online that you shouldn’t wash your hair, and that’s why your hair is falling out, is absurd,” Gaunitz said. “If your scalp is unhealthy, or you are shedding in any way, you need to be shampooing regularly,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sebum on your scalp harbors bacteria, fungi and other bodily excretions. Removing this buildup is crucial to preventing further inflammation, Gaunitz said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wash your hair daily or at least every 48 hours by scrubbing the surface of your scalp,” he advised. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3. Slathering garlic juice, onion juice or undiluted rosemary oil directly on your scalp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Although there are benefits to each of these, applying them directly to the scalp alters the microbiome,” Gaunitz said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have become public enemy number one in nutrition debates. From dementia to obesity and an epidemic of “food addiction”, these factory-made products, including crisps, ready meals, fizzy drinks and packaged snacks, are blamed for a wide range of modern health problems. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-025-01143-7"&gt;Some experts argue&lt;/a&gt; that they’re “specifically formulated and aggressively marketed to maximise consumption and corporate profits”, hijacking our brain’s reward systems to make us eat beyond our needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-the-house-of-lords-food-and-health-report/government-response-to-the-house-of-lords-food-diet-and-obesity-committees-report-recipe-for-health-a-plan-to-fix-our-broken-food-system"&gt;Policymakers have proposed&lt;/a&gt; bold interventions: warning labels, marketing restrictions, taxes, even outright bans near schools. But how much of this urgency is based on solid evidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I wanted to step back and ask: what actually makes people like a food? And what drives them to overeat – not just enjoy it, but keep eating after hunger has passed? &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666325001825?via%3Dihub"&gt;We studied more than 3,000 UK adults&lt;/a&gt; and their responses to over 400 everyday foods. What we found challenges the simplistic UPF narrative and offers a more nuanced way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two ideas often get blurred in nutrition discourse: liking a food and hedonic overeating (eating for pleasure rather than hunger). Liking is about taste. Hedonic overeating is about continuing to eat because the food feels good. They’re related, but not identical. Many people like porridge but rarely binge on it. Chocolate, biscuits and ice cream, on the other hand, top both lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted three large online studies where participants rated photos of unbranded food portions for how much they liked them and how likely they were to overeat them. The foods were recognisable items from a typical UK shopping basket: jacket potatoes, apples, noodles, cottage pie, custard creams – more than 400 in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then compared these responses with three things: the foods’ nutritional content (fat, sugar, fibre, energy density), their classification as ultra-processed by the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-022-01099-1"&gt;widely used Nova system&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11575809/"&gt;a food classification method&lt;/a&gt; that groups foods by the extent and purpose of their processing – and how people perceived them (sweet, fatty, processed, healthy and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perception power&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some findings were expected: people liked foods they ate often, and calorie-dense foods were more likely to lead to overeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the more surprising insight came from the role of beliefs and perceptions. Nutrient content mattered – people rated high-fat, high-carb foods as more enjoyable, and low-fibre, high-calorie foods as more “bingeable”. But what people believed about the food also mattered, a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perceiving a food as sweet, fatty or highly processed increased the likelihood of overeating, regardless of its actual nutritional content. Foods believed to be bitter or high in fibre had the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666325001825?via%3Dihub"&gt;In one survey&lt;/a&gt;, we could predict 78% of the variation in people’s likelihood of overeating by combining nutrient data (41%) with beliefs about the food and its sensory qualities (another 38%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: how we think about food affects how we eat it, just as much as what’s actually in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to ultra-processed foods. Despite the intense scrutiny, classifying a food as “ultra-processed” added very little to our predictive models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we accounted for nutrient content and food perceptions, the Nova classification explained less than 2% of the variation in liking and just 4% in overeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ultra-processed-foods-are-everywhere-and-theyre-quietly-raising-health-risks-256419"&gt;not to say all UPFs are harmless&lt;/a&gt;. Many are high in calories, low in fibre and easy to overconsume. But the UPF label is a blunt instrument. It lumps together sugary soft drinks with fortified cereals, protein bars with vegan meat alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these products &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2025/spotlight-upfs-nih-explores-link-between-ultra-processed-foods-and-heart-disease"&gt;may be less healthy&lt;/a&gt;, but others can be helpful – especially for older adults with low appetites, people on restricted diets or those seeking convenient nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message that all UPFs are bad &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/step-4-eat-and-live-smart/cholesterol-smart-upfs#Can-UPFs-be-heart-healthy"&gt;oversimplifies the issue&lt;/a&gt;. People don’t eat based on food labels alone. They eat based on how a food tastes, how it makes them feel and how it fits with their health, social or emotional goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relying on UPF labels to shape policy could backfire. Warning labels might steer people away from foods that &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/step-4-eat-and-live-smart/cholesterol-smart-upfs#which-UPFs-can-be-heart-healthy"&gt;are actually beneficial&lt;/a&gt;, like wholegrain cereals, or create confusion about what’s genuinely unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we recommend a more informed, personalised approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Boost food literacy: help people understand what makes food satisfying, what drives cravings, and how to recognise their personal cues for overeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Reformulate with intention: design food products that are enjoyable and filling, rather than relying on bland “diet” options or ultra-palatable snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Address eating motivations: people eat for many reasons beyond hunger – for comfort, connection and pleasure. Supporting alternative habits while maximising enjoyment could reduce dependence on low-quality foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It’s not just about processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some UPFs &lt;a href="https://post.parliament.uk/research-briefings/post-pb-0059/"&gt;do deserve concern&lt;/a&gt;. They’re calorie dense, aggressively marketed and often sold in oversized portions. But they’re not a smoking gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labelling entire categories of food as bad based purely on their processing misses the complexity of eating behaviour. What drives us to eat and overeat is complicated but not beyond understanding. We now &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663318/"&gt;have the data&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666324004963"&gt;and models&lt;/a&gt; to unpack those motivations and support people in building healthier, more satisfying diets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the nutritional and sensory characteristics of food – and how we perceive them – matter more than whether something came out of a packet. If we want to encourage better eating habits, it’s time to stop demonising food groups and start focusing on the psychology behind our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

That individual was hospitalized with the condition earlier this month, the health department said, but is now recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said this person was likely infected in the southern half of the county in July, near the Jordan River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is spread to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes, and both health departments urged people to protect themselves from mosquito bites to prevent contracting the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department said Thursday that 108 mosquito samples have tested positive for West Nile virus this year across the state, and because mosquitoes can travel several miles, everyone near any of those areas should take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week's report from the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said mosquitoes have been found with West Nile virus in the Bear River Health District, Davis County, Salt Lake County, TriCounty (Uintah, Dagget and Duchesne) and in Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reported that the percentage of mosquito pools testing positive at this point in the year, 1.53%, is higher than the last two years — 1.41% in 2024 and 0.99% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Utah health department reported 14 cases of West Nile virus, 12 of which were the neuroinvasive form. It reported one Utahn died from the disease in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of West Nile virus, which appear between two and 14 days after a bite, include fever, headache, rash, vomiting, body aches and diarrhea. More severe cases can lead to neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department said many who become infected may not even know; between 20% and 30% of infected people will not have symptoms and others will have only minor symptoms. It is estimated that less than 1% of people with West Nile virus develop the neuroinvasive form, which can lead to debilitating complications or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, there are likely many more than three Utahns who have been infected this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bear River Health Department suggested protection through "the 5 Ds": Drain standing water, avoid outdoor activities at dawn and dusk, use bug spray with DEET, dress in loose, long clothing and ensure door and window screens are repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

(That's US$2,600 and US$6,500, or £2,000 and £4,900.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Ozempic vulva' is the latest unsightly and uncomfortable side effect being reported by women taking GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro (stock image posed by model)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The term labia puffing is a marketing term, not a formal medical one,' explains Dr Justin Perron, a specialist plastic surgeon and board member of the Australasian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The labia majora, like other fatty areas, can lose volume after substantial weight loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These changes are more pronounced with rapid weight loss and in women over 35, where natural collagen and elastin reserves are already reduced,' adds Dr Perron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Effects may include deflation (a wrinkled appearance) and diminished elasticity, resulting in sagging or folds that make activities such as cycling, running or sex less comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 79,000 Australians are estimated to be using Ozempic, the GLP-1 injectable drug used both to treat diabetes and weight loss. The average patient loses an estimated 10-15 per cent of their body weight on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these drugs have transformed many bodies, the toll of rapid weight loss shows up from head to toe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, tirzepatide) and other effective weight-loss interventions have created a new subset of patients experiencing rapid, significant weight loss,' Dr Perron says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Loss of subcutaneous fat is global – including the mons pubis and labia majora – sometimes giving the area a deflated or "aged" look. This can be due to ptosis of soft tissue, or atrophy of the fat in this area.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds that while formal registry data is limited, some ASAPS members have reported a rise in requests for vulvo-vaginal aesthetic procedures, including labia majora augmentation, over the past five to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This parallels trends in America and Britain, where it's often bundled under "genital rejuvenation",' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Requests for 'labia-puffing' treatments to restore volume are on the rise (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perron notes that, anecdotally, he has seen an increase in genital rejuvenation consultations as a direct result of post-weight loss changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I personally see these requests several times a week,' he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-surgical labia puffing requires little downtime - light activity can resume almost immediately, though sex and intense exercise are usually off-limits for up to a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Risks can include bruising, swelling, asymmetry, overcorrection, infection, filler migration and rare vascular compromise,' notes Dr Perron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgical options - such as fat grafting or dermal fat grafts, occasionally with skin removal - require significantly greater downtime, and include risks such as 'swelling, bruising, infection, seroma, fat necrosis, oil cysts, asymmetry or partial fat loss requiring revision.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-7ff086d0-798b-11f0-b25e-05c31ac3b316" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14998721/I-Ozempic-vulva-latest-bizarre-effect-miracle-jabs-no-one-talks-theres-one-treatment-fix-it.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;READ MORE FROM DAILYMAIL+ &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;EXCLUSIVE NEWS AND FEATURES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14778367/Zoran-Vidovic-Zagi-Kozarov-Bali-hotel-death-development.html"&gt;When Zoran plunged to his death at a Bali hotel, his heartbroken fiancée begged for answers.

West Nile virus is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year, West Nile virus activity in mosquitoes has been detected in seven southern Idaho counties and neighboring Malheur County, Oregon. Not all counties collect and test mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We strongly encourage Idahoans to fight the bite of mosquitoes to protect themselves and their families,” said Deputy State Epidemiologist Dr. Kathy Turner. “This tragic death from West Nile virus is a good reminder for all of us to take protective measures against mosquito bites. Wear long sleeves and pants outside and use insect repellent. Around your home and yard, reduce standing water where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected with West Nile virus do not experience symptoms. About one in five people who are infected with West Nile virus experience fever and other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swollen lymph glands or a rash. About one in 150 people who are infected experience severe illness affecting the brain and spinal cord, leading to hospitalization; about one in 10 people with severe West Nile virus die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Older adults and people with certain medical conditions are at greater risk of severe illness. Recovery from severe illness might take several weeks or months. Some effects might be permanent. Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you might be sick from West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To protect against West Nile virus infection, avoid mosquitoes, particularly between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active. In addition, everyone should:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wear loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants when outdoors.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Apply EPA-registered insect repellents to exposed skin. Carefully follow instructions on the product label, especially for children.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Find the repellent that is right for you by using EPA’s search tool at &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you"&gt;https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you&lt;/a&gt; or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Insect Repellent Chatbot at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/index.html"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wear clothing and gear treated with permethrin.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cover strollers and baby carriers with mosquito netting.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insect-proof your home by repairing or replacing damaged screens. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reduce standing water on property. Check and drain toys, trays or pots outdoors that can hold water.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Change bird baths, static decorative ponds, and animal water tanks weekly to prevent mosquito larvae that are in the water from becoming adults.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information, visit &lt;a href="https://westnile.idaho.gov"&gt;https://westnile.idaho.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 16:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNdmo4UUJJTWZFb1Q3U3pTUUVhalV0LV9ZZ2tqV19RTGduS0thOHlOMjR6WkktR0pXempqek9FVGJoWU11UlJIaEdFYmNJZ2hBWUJyVHl0eEpVR014eWFpOFFHY1ZkOGJTSHhwWTBvYUVscDQzUkczSDdZaHpSMDJIdGJfdk1VMjU5d1ZqQnRweTdIT3Vm</guid></item><item><title>OHSU研究发现，成千上万的心理困扰儿童被困在急诊室中达数天之久- OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxNMTdiaDJSZ2p4c3JnYTcxalQtSFAwYmI1VURvRkczZkk3SjItLUdxZkEzRy1uZHFrelNFR0pWT2JwcU1pZDY1VXZuNTBkT3pBVkdsbXNBUEVrTEhpRjlCa19PZjZtRDVVTklUdUNZSEFVVGFHSDM5UHhZNkh5TWhUd0I3MHh5Rlg2elZFRHpibXBxVnhIRVFRcVJXNmFHdGpNZkE4T1ppN21tZ1l6Q21Fc2tYcnFaSUEyUklIaHZLcDFvN0hU0gHYAUFVX3lxTE52ckdqVTA3ZlVFWnFwWGZTcTJLSUxJUzktaWt6VC0zMTI2WGhGWXlKcTlEcHJzSUcwUUdhbW4wNWcwR1B0OFczNHVpaHc0ZmExWHQxR3l6RVFBd00ybEtpaXk4aUNrRkhvcEpIZEh2SDJTRFliSWNzLWwyNmp1bGdlZVFvdkx6ZFphdjl4WGJnaHBRY3pqeWtzcHV1dzN4cjFQTXpOUExCLWtoM05Ma185RzVFZXVxdmNqYzhIM2U2MUxjMDVybFI1cDhsNWxYTmJMSjlQOEFlZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2HJMFUAPANHD3MMWKDGARQAGXY"&gt;A growing number of children in mental health crises are spending days, sometimes nearly a week, in hospital emergency rooms because there is nowhere else for them to go, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GRTULGOMQ5CMDMCFNANXOSNCNI"&gt;In a report published Friday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2837523?resultClick=1" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2837523?resultClick=1"&gt;JAMA Health Forum&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University examined Medicaid claims data from 44 states covering more than 255,000 pediatric emergency room visits for mental health conditions in 2022. They found that about 12% of those visits, or over 30,000, resulted in children being “boarded” in the emergency room for three to seven days while waiting for placement in proper treatment programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I65BOXI3XFDXNGS7NGPE3G3MHI"&gt;Dr. John McConnell, director of OHSU’s Center for Health Systems Effectiveness and lead author of the study, said he was surprised at how frequently children in crisis spent three or more days in the ER. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NK7A2FF5KVFGNL44WLYXPCVUZQ"&gt;“It points to a big gap in getting timely, appropriate care,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BFZLIW2XR5D2TC7S73PJZXXPEM"&gt;That wait time is far from recognized best practice. The Joint Commission, which sets health care benchmarks, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23785957/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;recommends that pediatric patients&lt;/a&gt; in mental distress be stabilized and moved out of the ER within four hours, as extended stays can jeopardize patient safety, slow the start of treatment and pull critical resources away from other urgent cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KSJ7FBQPTZHEJPFRENBHXT7CJU"&gt;The study found boarding was most common for children with suicidal thoughts, attempts or severe depression — conditions that have become more prevalent in recent years. The number of suicides among U.S. children and young adults rose 62% from 2007 to 2021, according t&lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128423" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RHWJJQR3LJAGVNG5KDCWGJ633E"&gt;Boarding rates also varied dramatically, from 2.7% in Arkansas to 27.3% in Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2F6RW4LHXJDXHER4GVTVSYOSUU"&gt;Oregon’s rate was just above the national average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XV6NUXR4ONBS5FU56XE57RYI4E"&gt;McConnell said the findings confirm years of anecdotal reports that psychiatric boarding is a nationwide problem, particularly for children covered by Medicaid, which insures nearly half of all U.S. kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N5ZEYT74TJALJF2Z7KWC2OMYOI"&gt;“It’s clear there aren’t enough places for kids to go, both in terms of inpatient beds and outpatient services,” McConnell said. “There’s also no single source of accountability for Medicaid patients having a mental health crisis. When these kids show up in the emergency department, it’s not clear who’s responsible for making sure they get timely care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="G7OTODCAOZBSDIS4LYV57GYUKM"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2019/09/a-beloved-child-with-big-needs-faces-a-daunting-shortage-of-available-help.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2019/09/a-beloved-child-with-big-needs-faces-a-daunting-shortage-of-available-help.html"&gt;shortage of treatment options&lt;/a&gt; has left emergency departments — historically designed for broken bones, infections and acute injuries — as the fallback for pediatric mental health crises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GGJFDTMW5ZHD5BN33A4SWAZ24I"&gt;That reality is evident at OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital. Psychiatric visits to the pediatric ER have nearly tripled since 2016, from 150 to 453 last year, said Dr. Rebecca Marshall, who leads the hospital’s pediatric psychiatry consult service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZBDCMDKJH5BQ7PSCZPRHBCBXUA"&gt;Marshall, who was not involved in the study, said the patients are evenly split between Medicaid and private insurance, a sign the problem extends far beyond the Medicaid-only snapshot in McConnell’s analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MYT6ALC4M5AV7JMW3UE457KEZY"&gt;“These aren’t just numbers,” she said. “They represent real kids, real families and the hospital staff trying to help them in a space that was never meant for this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MKROQ4JO55GS7BLAPEYXCJDMO4"&gt;Often, those kids arrive after telling a parent or guardian about suicidal thoughts, severe depression, or another struggle — only to be told there’s no psychiatric bed available, Marshall said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DQUWABEFEZHHPCHBXLZBVTGYXU"&gt;“It’s often disorienting and disappointing for youth and families,” she said. “They’re in limbo, in a place that’s not designed to be therapeutic, and sometimes it can make things worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="A2CTJS3ZXFDFRALCMWEYXKJ37I"&gt;In the ER’s confined environment — often without fresh air or activities — children can feel trapped, irritable or more depressed, Marshall said, adding that some become agitated enough to lash out or try to leave, even when it isn’t safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PA4XJG7BPZF6XEYQWJF6DH6GUY"&gt;At times, Marshall said, as many as half of the hospital’s pediatric emergency beds are occupied by children boarding for behavioral health reasons, forcing staff to improvise space for other emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ON3LSUHL2ZE6JENMEXZ6OQFWUQ"&gt;“You can train staff and add activities, but you can’t turn an ER into a therapeutic psychiatric space,” she said. “If we want kids to get better, we have to put them in the right environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:DJLDLHYKMJAR7F4OZ5UDKUCFZI" data-fusion-component="DJLDLHYKMJAR7F4OZ5UDKUCFZI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:DJLDLHYKMJAR7F4OZ5UDKUCFZI" data-fusion-component="DJLDLHYKMJAR7F4OZ5UDKUCFZI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KWQXHOCKZRF35JKWT2N242IZ5Y"&gt;Oregon has taken steps to expand behavioral health services, including a &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/hsd/bh-child-family/pages/iibht.aspx" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;$130 million investment in 2021 to increase community-based residential facilities&lt;/a&gt; for people with severe mental illness. But Marshall said those efforts haven’t kept pace with demand, in part because of how the state’s fragmented and often short-term approach to funding behavioral health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OJRJY2ORPFCBFI3QIABYD32HIQ"&gt;“The challenge has been scaling it up quickly enough,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QYQ6W4PBYRAN5FDRFZIHURGZCY"&gt;The state has also fallen short on some key mental health commitments.

              &lt;p&gt;Good news, everyone! Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have coined a new term to describe our brains being dumb. In a recent study, they provide evidence for a distinct but common kind of cognitive bias—one that makes us reluctant to take the easier path in life if it means retracing our steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers have named the bias the “doubling-back aversion.” In several experiments, they found that people often refuse to choose a more efficient solution or route if it requires them to double back on the progress already made. The findings suggest that people’s subjective fear of adding more to their workload and their hesitance to wipe the slate clean contribute to this bias, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Participants’ aversion to feeling their past efforts were a waste encouraged them to pursue less efficient means,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976251331053"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this May in Psychological Science.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Psychologists have detailed all sorts of biases related to digging our feet in when faced with important new information. People tend to stick to the status quo in choosing dinner at a favorite restaurant, for example, even when someone recommends a potentially tastier option. There’s also the sunk cost fallacy, or the reluctance to veer off a disastrous path and choose another simply because they’ve spent so much time or resources pursuing it. The researchers argue that their newly named bias is certainly a close cousin to the sunk cost fallacy and similar biases, but that it ultimately describes a unique type of cognitive pitfall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You’re going the wrong way!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their paper, they provide the example of someone whose flight from San Francisco to New York becomes massively delayed early on, leaving them stuck in Los Angeles. In one scenario, the traveler can get home three hours earlier than their current itinerary if they accept the airline’s offer of a new flight that first stops in Denver; in the second, the person is instead offered a flight that will also shave three hours off, but they’ll first have to travel back to San Francisco. Despite both flights saving the same amount of time, people are more likely to refuse the one that requires going back to their earlier destination, the paper explains (some people might even refuse the Denver flight, but that would be an example of the status quo bias and/or sunk cost fallacy at work, they note).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the researchers ran four different types of experiments. The experiments collectively involved more than 2,500 adults, some of whom were UC Berkeley students and others who were volunteers recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. In one test, people were asked to walk along different paths in virtual reality; another asked people to recite as many words starting with the same letter as possible. Across the various tests, the researchers found that people routinely exhibited this aversion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one experiment where people had to recite words starting with “G,” for instance, everyone was asked midway through if they wanted to stay with the same letter or switch to reciting words starting with “T” (a likely easier letter). In the control condition, this decision was framed as staying on the same task, simply with a new letter, but in the other, people were asked if they wanted to throw out the work they had done so far and start over on a new task. Importantly, the volunteers were also given progress bars for the task, allowing them to see they would perform the same amount of work no matter the choice (though again, “T” would be easier). About 75% of participants made the choice to switch in the control condition, but only 25% did the same when the switch was presented as needing to double back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Backwards feels wrong&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I was analyzing these results, I was like, ‘Oh, is there a mistake? How can there be such a big difference?'” said lead author Kristine Cho, a behavioral marketing PhD student at UC Berkely’s Haas School of Business, in a &lt;a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/2025-aug-doubling-back-aversion.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; to the Association for Psychological Science, publishers of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Other researchers will have to confirm the team’s findings, of course. And there are still plenty of questions to answer about this aversion, including how often we fall for it and whether it’s more likely to happen in some scenarios than others. But for now, it’s oddly comforting to know that there’s another thing I can possibly blame for my occasional stubbornness to take the faster subway train home.&lt;/p&gt;

If you like what you read and want it in your inbox, &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/wburtoday" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sign up here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Happy Friday. It's Fisherman's Feast weekend in the North End. WBUR's Hanna Ali has &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/08/01/italian-feasts-north-end-boston-fishermans-st-anthonys-newsletter"&gt;a guide on what to expect&lt;/a&gt; (the CliffsNotes: &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fishermansfeastboston/video/7269119175522618666"&gt;meatballs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDtAH-biY20"&gt;flying children&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But first, the news:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calling their own shots:&lt;/strong&gt; Massachusetts is eyeing a potential breakup with national vaccine guidelines, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overhauls federal policy. As part of &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-healey-files-245-billion-supplemental-budget-to-close-fiscal-year-2025"&gt;a larger supplemental spending bill filed yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, Gov. Maura Healey proposed giving the state’s Department of Public Health authority to "decouple" local immunization recommendations and requirements from federal standards. If passed, Healey's office said DPH could set independent standards for Massachusetts, "if the federal government fails to maintain a robust schedule of vaccine recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Why it matters: Typically, health insurance companies only agree to cover shots that have been recommended by &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee"&gt;an important advisory panel for the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. In June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip"&gt;dismissed the entire panel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430870/cdc-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr"&gt;appointed a new slate of members&lt;/a&gt; who have already given credence to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5438485/cdc-acip-rfk-thimerosal-vaccines"&gt;debunked fears&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines. The panel has also yet to release guidelines for COVID vaccines this fall, after the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/03/nx-s1-5421292/covid-vaccine-cdc-pregnant-kids-recommendations"&gt;dropped its recommendation for healthy adults&lt;/a&gt; under the age of 65 in May.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Healey's proposal came a day after The Boston Globe &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/13/metro/vaccine-kennedy-massachusetts-inoculations-shots-children-covid-flu/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that state health officials have been talking to peers in Connecticut, Maine, New York and Rhode Island about coordinating vaccine guidelines. The states would base their recommendations on advice from national professional groups, like the American Academy of Pediatrics, instead of the CDC. The coordinated guidelines could increase the odds that insurers cover the shots without federal approval, experts told the Globe. (While people could also still get shots without insurance paying for it, the COVID vaccine can cost up to $200 per shot.)&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;The concern: Massachusetts Department of Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein stressed that any potential break from federal policy must be a group effort, adding he's "incredibly worried" about individual states separately coming out with their own recommendations. "Even if those recommendations are fully based in science, the fact that they're coming out differently from different states is going to infuse the pretense of politicization into the recommendation process," Goldstein said during a meeting this week. "And so I've really encouraged the other state health officers — in particular in the Northeast, but anyone who will listen — to look to [groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics]."&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Zoom out: The debate comes as many Americans pass up vaccines. This past respiratory virus season, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html"&gt;less than half&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. adults got a flu shot and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html"&gt;less than a quarter&lt;/a&gt; got a COVID booster, according to CDC data. Meanwhile, DPH &lt;a href="https://www.wwlp.com/news/massachusetts/flu-covid-19-vaccination-rates-falling-among-health-care-workers/"&gt;reported this week&lt;/a&gt; that vaccination rates among Massachusetts health care workers are falling. For both flu and (especially) COVID shots, not one health care sector (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, EMS) met the state's 90% vaccination goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New perk: &lt;/strong&gt;The Boys and Girls Club of Boston is waiving membership fees for families this school year. Currently, the annual fees are $25 dollars for children between ages 6 and 12, and $5 for teens. BGCB President and CEO Robert Lewis Jr. said it can add up for the families the club serves in Boston and Chelsea, most of whom live below the poverty level. "We don't want the finances to be a burden in a time when parents are trying to figure out how to stretch a dollar," he told WBUR's Amy Sokolow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;In other youth sports news: &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/braintree-little-league-world-series-loss-irmo-south-carolina/"&gt;Things did not go great&lt;/a&gt; for the Braintree boys baseball team during their Little League World Series debut yesterday. They lost 13-0 to South Carolina (thanks in large part to a &lt;a href="https://x.com/espn/status/1956089622577950951"&gt;grand slam hitting&lt;/a&gt;, 75 mph-throwing pitcher on the opposing team). But it's not over yet. Braintree plays the team from Lamar, Texas, tomorrow at 3 p.m. in the elimination bracket.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stamp acts: &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. Postal Service unveiled yesterday two new Boston-themed stamps. One depicts Old North Church and the other shows a Paul Revere-esque midnight rider. They're meant to commemorate both 250 years since the American Revolution and the Boston 2026 World Expo, a major international stamp show coming to the city next May. (Coincidentally, the official stamp release came on &lt;a href="https://store.usps.com/store/product/boston-2026-world-stamp-show-stamps-S_487304"&gt;the 260th anniversary of the start of the Stamp Act protests&lt;/a&gt; in Boston.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heads up: &lt;/strong&gt;The MBTA is shutting down the entire Lowell commuter rail line this weekend and next (starting each Friday at 10 p.m.) due to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CzHDVaJuffW/"&gt;a bridge replacement project&lt;/a&gt; in Somerville.

			&lt;p&gt;Walk into any health store, scroll through TikTok, or browse the shelves of your favourite beauty retailer, and you'll be met with a familiar promise: that a pill, powder or potion could be the secret to glowing skin, boosted energy, or even inner "detoxification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the most hyped are chlorophyll – the green pigment in plants now found in trendy waters and tinctures – and collagen, the protein hailed as the holy grail for youthful skin and strong joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how much of the buzz is backed by science? And how much is just clever marketing dressed up in green juice and glossy packaging?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vegetarian-diets-can-slash-cancer-risk-by-up-to-45-large-study-finds"&gt;Vegetarian Diets Can Slash Cancer Risk by Up to 45%, Large Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take a closer look to explore what they actually do, what the evidence says, and whether your money (and hopes) might be better spent elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_128714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-128714" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/SHoppingForSupplements.jpg" alt="Person looking at products in a pharmacy" class="size-full wp-image-128714" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/SHoppingForSupplements.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/SHoppingForSupplements-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/SHoppingForSupplements-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-128714" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Taking supplements can be a waste of money, and sometimes even harmful.

One of the more persistent claims is that chlorophyll – in water or supplement form – &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/article/chlorophyll-benefits"&gt;can "oxygenate"&lt;/a&gt; the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/ben_goldacre_battling_bad_science/transcript"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt; – physician, academic and prominent critic of pseudoscience – has pointed out, that claim doesn't quite hold up. The human body, unlike a plant leaf, isn't flooded with sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And without light, chlorophyll simply can't perform photosynthesis in the gut or bloodstream. It can't generate oxygen internally – no matter how green your smoothie is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does chlorophyll actually do? Aside from turning plants (and your poo) a vivid shade of green, its core function is to trap sunlight and convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Cast your mind back to GCSE biology and the familiar &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zcphqhv/revision/2"&gt;photosynthesis equation&lt;/a&gt; scribbled across the whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this process, plants generate food for themselves and for animals – while releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. It's a pathway fundamental to life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since we breathe in oxygen and eat carbohydrates, we've managed to thrive without chlorophyll. And for it to work in humans the way it does in plants, it would surely need to be present in our skin – effectively turning us into the Wicked Witch of the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what about those wider health claims? Supplement packaging for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37513218/"&gt;chlorophyllin&lt;/a&gt; – a semi-synthetic, water-soluble form of chlorophyll thought to be more active – often promises detoxification, glowing skin, improved wound healing and even better body odour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171520" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Chlorophyll-Supplement.jpg" alt="A glass with green dispersing in a clear liquid, in front of a green plant leaf" class="wp-image-171520 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Chlorophyll-Supplement.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Chlorophyll-Supplement-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171520" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Chlorophyllin is a semi-synthetic, water-soluble form of chlorophyll. (AVRORRA/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suggested mechanisms? Chlorophyll may inhibit bacterial growth or neutralise foul-smelling compounds in the gut. It's also been proposed as a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40488267/"&gt;free radical&lt;/a&gt; scavenger – mopping up the unstable molecules generated by toxins or metabolism that can damage tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence is mixed. A few (much older) studies suggest chlorophyllin can reduce the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7350215/"&gt;odour of faeces and flatulence&lt;/a&gt;, although it might also turn them green. There's weaker evidence when it comes to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24592995/"&gt;halitosis&lt;/a&gt; or body odour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research supporting its role as an antioxidant is limited, and the buzz around weight loss is largely anecdotal. Realistically, any benefit in that department likely comes from a diet rich in greens – low in fat and high in fibre – rather than chlorophyll alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where things get more promising is in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40452232/"&gt;wound care&lt;/a&gt;. Chlorophyll-based dressings have been investigated for their ability to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38791586/"&gt;accelerate healing&lt;/a&gt; and reduce odours from infected wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But chlorophyll isn't the only so-called "miracle" substance being sold to the wellness crowd. Take collagen – arguably even more popular than any green powder or superfood pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collagen is a protein and a &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/collagen/"&gt;natural component of connective tissue&lt;/a&gt; found throughout the body. It gives strength and structure to the skin, bones, ligaments, blood vessels – even the heart and lungs. Without enough collagen – or in conditions where collagen production is impaired, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndromes/"&gt;Ehlers-Danlos syndrome&lt;/a&gt; – tissues can become fragile, prone to damage or slow to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the more reason, then, to make sure our bodies can produce it. Collagen is made from amino acids – the building blocks of protein – so &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-much-protein-do-you-really-need-too-much-or-too-little-can-be-harmful-261211"&gt;eating enough protein&lt;/a&gt; is essential. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-c/"&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; also plays a vital role, helping the body synthesise collagen from those amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do we really need to supplement it? What does the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40720447/"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; say? Some studies suggest oral collagen supplements may help improve skin appearance, support joint health, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38667776/"&gt;increase bone strength&lt;/a&gt;, and enhance muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's no convincing evidence that they promote weight loss or treat cardiovascular or autoimmune conditions – despite the lofty promises made by some brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topical collagen products are even more widespread, but their &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35223163/"&gt;scientific backing is thinner&lt;/a&gt;. Collagen molecules are generally too large to be absorbed through the skin, meaning they're unlikely to have any meaningful impact on wrinkles. At best, they may hydrate the surface and offer a temporary plumping effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the research is patchy – encouraging in some areas, inconclusive in others. And when it comes to supporting your body's natural collagen production, there may be more effective (and less expensive) options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods such as chicken, fish, eggs and &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-make-bone-broth-7479697"&gt;bone broth&lt;/a&gt; ensure a good protein intake. So too are collagen-supporting micronutrients, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="171513" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; C, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39969834/"&gt;copper and zinc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So unless you're &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/DwSFD5i7hu0?feature=shared"&gt;Poison Ivy from Batman&lt;/a&gt; (who, to be fair, looks fantastic), you probably don't need to load up on chlorophyll. And unless your diet is lacking, you don't need to shell out for collagen powders or creams either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love the skin you're in. It's better than turning green like Elphaba from Wicked.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261210/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The warts can start to look like horns or tentacles if they grow longer over time. The virus is found in cottontail rabbits, especially during the summer months, when there is higher rabbit density and insect activity. While CPW has received around a dozen reports of sightings over the last week, Van Hoose speculates that there probably aren’t that many cases of SPV, but rather, many people are likely seeing the same group of infected rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Most infected cottontails can survive the viral infection, after which the growths will go away," CPW says on its &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://cpw.state.co.us/species/cottontail-rabbits#:~:text=Rabbit%20Papillomas,be%20treated%20by%20a%20veterinarian." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:website;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is no risk of virus transmission to humans or other animals, though the CPW recommends that humans and pets should still stay away from and not interact with infected rabbits if they cross paths. However, the CPW also notes that domestic rabbits, if they are housed outside, could contract the virus from infected insects or rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-to-do-if-you-spot-a-rabbit-with-spv"&gt;What to do if you spot a rabbit with SPV&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cottontail rabbit with SPV growths, photographed in Minnesota. (Education Images/Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rabbits remain mostly healthy after contracting SPV, even if the growths get very long and start to look like horns, which is why the CPW does not recommend euthanizing the infected rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If someone sees a rabbit with the black tumors on its head or neck it is not a concern for Animal Control,” Julie Lindstrom, a supervisor at Sioux Falls Police Animal Control, told Keloland, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.keloland.com/keloland-com-original/what-to-do-if-you-spot-a-papilloma-rabbit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a South Dakota news outlet;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a South Dakota news outlet&lt;/a&gt;. “There is no rehabilitation for wild rabbits with this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SPV is only harmful when the growths start to interfere with a rabbit’s ability to eat or drink, which does not happen in every case. A person may be able to spot if this is a problem if they notice the rabbit doesn’t seem able to hop properly, Lindstrom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you find a dead rabbit on your property, regardless of whether it is visibly infected or not, Lindstrom noted that it is safe to wear gloves and handle the animal yourself if you feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 14:25:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxNVFduVmFxOFBFdXBra0h6ekhiLTZ1M3dKMmJSa3dXU2JIaGUtS1lpZHM5aUEyWXZHSWp1TEJUSmw0bHNRMVU3UDFaeWRiUFQ5OTQ1NXd5bzNPb0djaEN1TWpUam0zMWRSa3B3ckE2MlFDVjROVDYxd1JZUnlocTZ3OVpYY2ItNGNXMmR0SldlSWtOSElfcEMycUFJYmlvcW1RWHNvMXU0d2VKU3N4VmozbUJkTE1lc0MtaXR6b25Ob1hDVmVWd1pRcFBnbS0xWnhZcnQxbXBYWHlBZw</guid></item><item><title>市政府表示，政府大楼是军团爆发的来源之一，导致4人死亡-高谭市</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxPNmt0dmlrZVFocFFTQUtxTnNnUlNnTWctRXdMR19mYmVja2FqUm9JSnBVM1hLbHkxRTVzMmpTSjMzd1Jkc293WXAwT1NWc1dBNTloVDBRUFRTXy1EblIxczlyb0xnSkNOVENEVHRMSUJzWkFCdWRSMm1aRXY1MGdEbTJzeW43VjU4S0xEelhPMXlnc3p5dVBDRVVOamhLbkFwOGtDUmZBc3BqSFBxLVVBc0l3ci05ZUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ra6vh"&gt;A fourth person has died in the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Central Harlem, while the number of those stricken with the severe pneumonia increased to 99, up from 90 earlier in the week, the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reported Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="41j79"&gt;The new tallies came hours after city officials disclosed that several buildings housing government programs are among those where water-cooling towers have tested positive for Legionella, the bacteria that causes the disease, amid an investigation into the source of the disease outbreak in Central Harlem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8kd6s"&gt;That includes CUNY City College’s Marshak Science Building at 181 Convent Ave., the NYC Economic Development Corp. at 40 West 137th St., and the city health department’s Central Harlem Sexual Health Clinic at 2238 Fifth Ave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bl934"&gt;Among the 10 buildings identified by the health department, all but one had cooling towers that were either behind on required Legionella testing or had not been inspected by the city in the past year, according to a Gothamist analysis of city data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9ltk6"&gt;By law, building owners are required to test for the presence of Legionella bacteria every three months. While the city is not required to regularly inspect cooling towers, health department spokesperson Chantal Gomez said the agency aims to inspect every tower annually. She added that staff shortages have made that difficult in recent years, but the agency is continuing to recruit inspectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4pif4"&gt;Harlem Hospital, a city-run medical center where many Legionnaires’ patients in the current outbreak have been treated, also tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f5fcq"&gt;City officials said they are still working to confirm which specific cooling tower caused the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fadhi"&gt;Legionella bacteria can grow in buildings’ water-cooling towers and then get spewed into the air with the mist the towers emit. If it’s inhaled, Legionella can cause Legionnaires’ disease, a severe form of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6nunu"&gt;The city previously said 11 cooling towers in the area had tested positive for Legionella through an initial screening process, but declined to share their addresses at the time. City officials said they have now completed a more rigorous form of testing and found 12 cooling towers that tested positive. All but one have already undergone remediation and the final one will undergo remediation by tomorrow, city officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c3od2"&gt;The number of new cases of Legionnaires’ being reported has begun to decline, suggesting that the bacteria's source has been contained, acting city Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said at a press conference on the outbreak at Harlem Hospital Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7fmev"&gt;“I want to assure everyone the air is safe to breathe,” Mayor Eric Adams said at the press conference, held hours before the fourth death was announced. “I know the Central Harlem community and so many New Yorkers are anxious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1qthm"&gt;In recent weeks, the city has advised people who live and work in the ZIP codes affected by the outbreak (10027, 10030, 10035, 10037 and 10039) to seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms associated with Legionnaires’, including cough, trouble breathing, fever, chills or muscle aches. Legionnaires’ can be treated effectively with antibiotics if it’s caught early, city health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fvq1o"&gt;Morse said she and other city health workers have been busy spreading the word about Legionnaires’ to keep people safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5iqm5"&gt;But some Harlem residents criticized the city for not previously releasing the addresses of the water-cooling towers that initially screened positive for Legionella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7ksqn"&gt;Morse &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/acting-nyc-health-commissioner-defends-citys-communications-on-legionnaires-disease" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; the move on WNYC earlier this week, saying, “The reason we have yet to release the building locations, again, is because of this concern that we’d be giving people a false sense of security before our investigation is really fully complete.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a587t"&gt;At the time, Morse said that because Legionella can travel through the air, everyone in the five affected ZIP codes should be vigilant about Legionnaires’ symptoms, regardless of whether they live near the buildings that tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ajh70"&gt;State Sen. Cordell Cleare, a Harlem Democrat, said she plans to push for new state legislation to improve cooling tower regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3t202"&gt;“As much as we’ve responded to this, three lives is too many,” Cleare said. “Our communities cannot continue to serve as the canary in the coal mine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="69hpi"&gt;A Gothamist analysis of public data found that city &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/legionnaires-inspections-sank-to-near-record-low-ahead-of-nyc-outbreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inspections have dropped off&lt;/a&gt; significantly since they started in 2017.
