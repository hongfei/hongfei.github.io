It staged the trial in conjunction with six NHS hospitals in England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Shiva Tripathi, an NHS pain consultant and the chief investigator of the trial, said if the drug is approved by regulators and becomes available it would be “a gamechanger for chronic lower back pain on the similar levels as [how] antibiotics made a difference to infection. Because if we can get these 25% of the patients with chronic low back pain back to work, back to no medications, back to no more disability, then I think [that] will be the massive gamechanger for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, the randomised controlled trial involved only 44 patients – 22 in Britain and 22 in Spain, Denmark and New Zealand – so PP353 will have to undergo further trials, and be endorsed by the medicines watchdogs, before doctors can offer it to patients to relieve their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The patients had all had severe back pain for at least six months, and in some cases more than five years, that had not responded to conventional treatment, such as painkilling medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Persica said that a big advantage of their treatment is that the patient has two injections four days apart rather than undergoing surgery or taking tablets for a long time. Recent &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/18/only-10-of-non-surgical-treatments-for-back-problems-kill-pain-says-review" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research found&lt;/a&gt; that most of the 56 ways of trying to alleviate back pain which researchers studied – ranging from massage and acupuncture to painkillers and physiotherapy – brought little or no real relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;PP353 is a combination of three substances that are already widely used in medicine: linezolid, an antibiotic; iohexol, a contrast agent or dye; and a thermosensitive gel. It is injected into the lower back in order to banish an infection that has developed around the discs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Steve Ruston, the firm’s chief executive, said: “Our first patient trial produced really positive results. [It produced] significant reductions in pain and disability and [patients also got] clinically meaningful benefit and statistically significant benefit. The patient benefit potential is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you can reduce the pain and disability that people are living with in the way that some of our [trial] patients have responded, it will transform their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Market research shows that 2 million people in the US and 250,000-300,000 in the UK could benefit, he added. “Millions of people around the world can benefit from this. But low back pain is not just a first-world problem; everybody gets low back pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The drug is different from other back pain treatments, Ruston added, because it targets the underlying cause of the problem rather than just its main symptom – pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/low-back-pain" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Low back pain&lt;/a&gt; is one of the world’s commonest health problems. Six in 10 people in the UK develop it at some point. It is expected to grow as a problem worldwide because of the ageing and growing population. It is often hard to diagnose the cause and even harder to treat successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many patients in the trial experienced a drop in the amount of pain they were suffering within a month of the injections and were still feeling a lot better after a year, Persica said. However, it reduced, but did not remove, the need to keep taking painkillers, Ruston added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But Dr Benjamin Ellis, a consultant rheumatologist at Imperial Healthcare NHS trust in London, who specialises in chronic pain, voiced scepticism about PP353’s potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Modern medicine has largely failed people with chronic – in other words, long-term – back pain. But there is little evidence that interventions using surgery or injections, or even taking medicines, makes much difference for the vast majority of people with chronic low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“People with chronic low back pain are understandably desperate for anything that can help. There’s also a huge industry in supplying technologies and medicines that claim to help, but little evidence that these do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Promising holistic approaches, such as cognitive functional therapy, often don’t get a look in, particularly when services are overstretched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“That being said, if there is a subgroup of people with chronic low back pain that can reliably and safely benefit from a simple pair of injections, then that would be fantastic news – but it seems unlikely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 18:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQTzlldDZ2MHBrU2h1V0dUMUFxV2hBV2t5MXhlQkF3dGF2cllyOWVqUTNxYW11dWdodktZcGxUTnFmQTliUmZabmh2a0NGYmpvN0pkWngtOFFsZnBTZDNBYjU1eHJpekFBWEJRTmlaYU9kSXNHWFJIRjFKak1QV0piQ2x2cGk2R3k2Z1QxN19jSFVTV29pc0ZBWHlSeU9PeGI4</guid></item><item><title>Nearly 500 cases of measles reported across 19 states: CDC - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPMU02Y3ZyTGRlMGl5WmM1X2FoZXU3Um1FdEJoYkNjRGV0a0dYamNZZjJUUy1oU2VRTTRRTWdCdTg0ZHNSdUZKZjlWNTQybk9RcThacjRfSVpfZ2pISEtLbjlZSVhvVGptdG5kRXFyaGh4OW5mU18yNnBGcHZscFpJbFVDeFpuRjRZTndsOERoZ082LVlQblNqTDFoMDlyckZHemfSAacBQVVfeXFMTVVSNGVHUk9PVmJRZzFwU3ZPbHFEX1d1Zko1QXF3eUttNllJOWRzT3pZc1dyUjExS19rLU9zN2l0ZUtOdF93azRIcFJYYm5tLXR5ZllPdUg1WHEzcjktbHJ4YTJMY25BOWtJVFJnVUZKUS0wUEtKRUxvZFdxR2xlaENwOGR3b09FOWRSTlg3dFpWN3BhMnp1aFd6UDhTdWU4NFhnTmdRVEU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The number of measles cases associated with an outbreak in western Texas has grown to 400, with 73 cases reported over the last three days, according to new data released Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Almost all of the cases are in unvaccinated individuals or in individuals whose vaccination status is unknown, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS).

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e4kf00233572gv9tpkgm@published"&gt;My 14-year-old, “Kim,” was recently diagnosed with a condition that is not life-threatening but that does need to be managed by a specialist. There are not many specialists, as the condition is relatively rare. She must see this specialist every 4-to-6 weeks for at least a year or two. Our family gets our health insurance from my husband’s employer; if the doctor is in-network, the copays are very affordable. A handful of in-network specialists are within a two-hour drive of our house, and they are all male doctors. The problem is, Kim refuses to see a male doctor, as her condition may require occasional physical examinations on a private area. I totally get Kim’s feelings; I prefer female doctors if they will see me naked, but I will see a male doctor in an emergency or if there are no other options.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e4pd00243572j1572s0l@published"&gt;There are one or two female doctors out-of-network that are driving distance, but paying out-of-pocket for monthly visits (not to mention testing if these doctors use only out-of-network labs) will be cost-prohibitive without cutting the budget elsewhere. I am unsure what to do and feel there is no good answer. It does feel wrong to make Kim see a doctor she feels uncomfortable with. On the other hand, I do not want to lessen our contributions to retirement accounts, college funds, and other savings. My daughters (I have two other teens) do one non-school-sponsored extracurricular (music lessons, dance classes, etc.). I do not want this to impact my other girls, and it feels unfair to ask Kim to choose between flute lessons or a female doctor. Forgoing medical care is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

I have told her that these male doctors will allow her to have a female nurse or patient advocate in the room with her during the exams and that I (her mom) could go in the examination room with her if she wants me to. But Kim still protests when I bring up seeing the male doctor. What do you think I should do?&lt;/p&gt;

Either Kim will have to get past her discomfort with male doctors, or there will have to be significant financial sacrifices made to accommodate her. I think you should let your daughter know that there are likely to be times in her life when a female doctor may not be an option, such as on a trip to the emergency room; it’s also possible that if she continues to have to manage this rare condition, there may not be female specialists available in the future—it would be best to help her get past this aversion now.&lt;/p&gt;

Reiterate your promise to be in the exam room with her, and alert the practice about your daughter’s anxiety, so that the doctors and staff may be extra sensitive. Gently explain to her that she simply cannot forgo this care and that she has no choice but to allow a man to treat her.&lt;/p&gt;

Ever since last year, when her friend had to drop out because she got long-COVID, my daughter has become obsessed with it. First, she was just obsessively reading articles on health and wellness, but now she’s sending me studies from medical journals about how getting COVID affects all these organs and aspects of the body. Worse yet, now she’s bought this high-end respirator that looks like some kind of space alien mask and refuses to be around people if she’s not wearing it. She’s even talking about changing her major to epidemiology and abandoning her dream of being a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2e59e002e3572ilfe5er6@published"&gt;I’m worried that she’s alienating herself from her peers and making herself a target for social ostracism. We were reasonably cautious during the pandemic when she was in high school, but I don’t bother masking anymore since we’ve had the virus a few times and it didn’t seem so bad. Now, however, my daughter has me reconsidering the choice to stop masking since she’s constantly telling me about some horrible outcome that someone she read about had from it. I don’t want her to be right about this, especially since this choice is almost certainly hurting her socially, but the more I’ve researched it myself, the more I think she may have a point. How can I help her balance these fears without letting her get totally alienated from her peers for being the weird girl in the mask?&lt;/p&gt;

Most of us stopped taking COVID seriously a couple of years ago, but it is still very much out here; furthermore, long-COVID sufferers are experiencing devastating symptoms, and we still don’t know all the long-term effects of even a short course of the virus. It seems unreasonable to me to be concerned about the social impact on your daughter when it sounds like she’s taking wise steps to protect herself from what could be a devastating illness, particularly when you consider what happened to her classmate.&lt;br&gt;Ask yourself, does she have meaningful friendships? Has her social life suffered since she started taking COVID more seriously, or are you just assuming that the respirator turns people off?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t2ko4c00363572vj3pwh6i@published"&gt;As a compromise, you could encourage her to continue masking up but ask her to consider a less obtrusive N95 mask for situations in which she needs to interact with people, such as at school or at family functions. But honestly, it sounds like she knows what she’s doing here better than a lot of us do. If your daughter’s concern about this starts to turn into a true fixation or obsession, in the sense that it is damaging the rest of her life, get her to a therapist to parse out sensible protection from problematic anxiety. But for now, I’d say let her take care of her own health as she chooses.&lt;/p&gt;

He says everything about her is better and he’s never been happier. I broke up with him, hoping he would realize his abusive ways need to change. Instead, he got this girlfriend and now messages me multiple times a day about how he hates me (with awful insults) and loves her. I’m so heartbroken! He claims to have gotten a job, but all the years I was with him, he never worked once. He says he’s gonna marry her, but would tell me I don’t deserve it. I don’t understand why he can do all these things for someone new who won’t even give him a place to stay, but not me? What’s wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;

Should I wait and hope this passes and that he will come to his senses? Do I write him a letter about how sad I am? Should I contact his mother or aunt? I used to tell his dad about how his son was behaving, and he would set him straight, but he died recently. I just want this whole ordeal to end.&lt;/p&gt;

He abused you during the relationship and continues to abuse you via text message. There is nothing wrong with you that is preventing your ex from treating you the way you deserve to be treated. He is not a good guy, and you know that. Instead of agonizing over what he may or may not be doing for his alleged new woman (whom he may be fabricating just to get under your skin), you need to be focused on taking care of yourself and your child. Why would you want a man who mistreats you, doesn’t work, and uses his relationship to you to determine if he sees his son or not?&lt;/p&gt;

I am assuming that this guy doesn’t voluntarily give you money for your child. If you could use some additional support, consider going through the process of having him forced to pay child support through the court system. As far as facilitating visits goes, see if you can coordinate through his mother or aunt so you don’t have to deal with him harassing you about what you’re doing during that time. Let this man know that you are interested in allowing him to have a relationship with his son, but that you will only be willing to do that if he can both treat you with respect and be consistent. If he is unwilling to accept these terms, then do away with visitation.&lt;/p&gt;

Has your son been a witness to how his father talks to you? If not, would you want him to see that? If so, have you considered the impact that may have on his relationships with women in the future? Would you want your son to grow up to be like his father? You have to (quickly) dry your eyes and move past your interest in this guy. The only thing he can do for you is step-up and be an active father to your child. If he refuses to do that, then you need to eliminate him from your life altogether. But the longer you hold on to the fantasy of having him as a partner, the longer he’ll be able to hurt you, and that will certainly impact your child in ways you do not want.&lt;/p&gt;

            On March 10, Dr. Nisha Acharya got a letter from the National Institutes of Health terminating her grant to study the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine recommended for all adults 50 and older in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400022e6b7o1s5hy5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The grant was canceled after a change in NIH policy to not “prioritize research activities that focus on gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” according to the termination letter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400032e6baq6nlbmr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The policy shift was no surprise: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, now leads the US Department of Health and Human Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What was surprising about her grant cancellation is that she’s not studying vaccine hesitancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400052e6b38c6vl67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rather, in a written description of her research, Acharya said, “I had the words ‘hesitancy’ and ‘vaccine’ in the same sentence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400062e6bu2xdo68n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She thinks her funding was caught in a dragnet of NIH grant cancellations driven by haphazard, error-prone word searches rather than careful review of the research in question. HHS has not clarified how it is selecting grants for termination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400072e6bqjuoqrpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past few weeks, the NIH has canceled at least two dozen grants to researchers who were looking at ways to increase vaccination rates or fight vaccine hesitancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400082e6bz48qah1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The changes come as scientists and universities are already reeling from cuts to funding for research about &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/nih-climate-change-funding-propublica/index.html"&gt;climate science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/health/hiv-research-funding-cut/index.html"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and many other topics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc400092e6b2qgxdyat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Acharya, the cancellation wipes out just over three years of funding on her current grant that she says is worth almost $2 million in direct and indirect costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc4000a2e6bfqqz8e2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a result, she plans to lay off three full-time employees who were working with her to analyze large amounts of data related to the vaccine. Acharya, a clinician scientist at the University of California at San Francisco, will keep her job seeing patients, although the grant paid about 35% of her salary, which she used for time to conduct research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000b2e6b7y31dpyp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t have a way of continuing this work,” said Acharya, who is planning to appeal the decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000c2e6b6zj0kf30@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy, a lawyer, testified that he was “pro-safety” and “pro-good science.” He denied being anti-vaccine and has said he wants people to know the risks and benefits of the vaccinations before they get them, a principle called informed consent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000d2e6b0nz7wey1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s what Acharya wants, too. She believes that studies on vaccine hesitancy are valid and worthwhile and should continue to be funded — but it’s not what she’s studying.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000e2e6blya06h2k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not anti-vax. I am pro-science, whether it’s positives or negatives,” she said. “I understand that with any medicine, any vaccine, there may be things that are very good and things that people may need to be cautious about. That is the goal, right?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000g2e6b6c7xkf79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya is an ophthalmologist, or eye doctor, who studies inflammatory diseases of the eye. Until March 10, she was studying the benefits and risks of the shingles vaccine, particularly as it relates to an infection called herpes zoster ophthalmicus: shingles in the nerves around the eye. This complication is painful and can lead to blindness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000h2e6ba64nln49@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 1 in 3 adults will have shingles at some point in their lives, and Acharya said that 10% to 20% of those cases will involve shingles of the eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000i2e6bemutwkr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The clinical trials that test vaccines can tell researchers whether a shot will generally be effective at preventing the more severe complications of an infection. Clinical trials can also catch common safety issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000j2e6bqt1ceztv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But rare side effects and adverse events from vaccines often aren’t picked up until they’re launched across the population and used by hundreds of thousands of people of different ages and sexes and with different underlying conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000k2e6bmtv0zu06@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya was studying all those questions related to the Shingrix vaccine, which landed on the US market in 2018. It is recommended for all adults 50 and older to prevent painful bouts of shingles, a reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000l2e6bovuprocr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya said she saw an opportunity to gather more data. “Those trials that led to FDA approval did not include people who had had shingles already. They don’t really include people who are sick or had a lot of medical problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000m2e6bm25zahx4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to really understand how well the vaccine is working for different age groups, for different people, maybe people who have different comorbidities or different conditions, like who are immunocompromised, people who already have had shingles, already have had shingles on the eye. There’s all these questions that we have no data for, no information,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000o2e6bvrbgvysk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She applied for and won a grant through the NIH to study these questions. It’s a highly competitive process that requires months of work to prepare and submit, and goes through rounds of review from peers before it’s awarded.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000p2e6bslbb4tyk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After her first five-year grant, Acharya was able to show that her work had produced important findings: for example, that the vaccine was safe and effective at preventing shingles – including around the eye – in people who had not had it before. So the NIH awarded her another round of five-year funding to continue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000q2e6b951m3r2x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said she wanted her second round of research to dig into a question that made her fellow ophthalmologists hesitant to recommend the vaccine to their patients: Many of them had seen people who got the vaccine experience a dangerous reawakening of the virus in their eyes. Was it a coincidence or a real risk?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000r2e6ba70vd6g3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m in a very specialized field, and we actually have a little bit of concern in this very specialized subgroup of people who already have shingles in the eye,” Acharya said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000s2e6bvm3ux9ed@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya wanted to see whether it was true that the vaccine could trigger another bout of shingles inflammation. In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2814944?resultClick=1" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology, she showed that it could — an important safety consideration. GSK did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sxw9zu00003b6moim18g87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the study, Acharya urged more monitoring of patients. She imagined that this data might eventually be used to refine recommendations about who should get the vaccine. But it was just the first study; more research is needed for such a change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000t2e6bo048trak@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, her grant was cancelled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rwq6e000013b6m9x1dmuol@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS didn’t answer specific questions about how it was deciding to terminate grants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000v2e6b2katgn8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HHS is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities. At HHS, we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science. As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” an HHS official said in a statement to CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000w2e6bdwbs0v6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acharya calls it “ironic” that her grant was flagged. “I never got to explain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000x2e6bg699um14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She says the program officers overseeing her grant at the NIH knew her work well, and “they didn’t have any part in this decision.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc5000z2e6b0qleb9n6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The letter gives her 30 days to appeal the termination if she believes that it was made in error, and the appeal goes directly to Dr. Matthew Memoli, who has been acting director of the agency while new NIH Director &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/jay-bhattacharya-confirmation-hearing-nih/index.html"&gt;Dr. Jay Bhattacharya&lt;/a&gt; was awaiting confirmation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What really makes Acharya sad is the effect of the funding cuts on her colleagues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc500122e6bju799pyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t save them,” she said. “I’m trying to call people and try to get jobs for them. I’m trying to set up interviews and stuff, but it’s really hard.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8rw8wc500142e6brqqrl23s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Universities have lost so much federal research funding that many are coping with their own grant cancellations and doing their own belt-tightening. There’s a &lt;a href="https://chancellor.ucsf.edu/news/uc-hiring-freeze-and-financial-outlook" target="_blank"&gt;hiring freeze&lt;/a&gt; at UCSF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s not these people’s fault that they ended up being in a research group that was good, it was so promising, and their careers would have been made, and now it’s gone, and they’re gonna be out of a job,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Adenosine is a molecule that helps regulate bodily functions like sleep, blood pressure, and heart rate—and when caffeine blocks these receptors, the body responds by making you feel more awake, focused, and energized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The downside? This impact can also lead to physical sensations like increased heart rate, rapid breathing, and muscle tension—all symptoms that may mimic anxiety.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-coffee-can-cause-anxiousness" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Why Coffee Can Cause Anxiousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Can coffee cause anxiety even in non-anxious people? The short answer: usually no, but there are exceptions. “In the general population, you don’t see people who generate anxiety disorders if they drink about one to three cups of coffee per day,” says &lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/2183/bio" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/2183/bio" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Astrid Nehlig" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.1.0"&gt;Astrid Nehlig&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a neuroscientist and research director at &lt;a href="https://www.ilae.org/astrid-nehlig" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ilae.org/astrid-nehlig" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="INSERM" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.3.0"&gt;INSERM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Strasbourg, France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;However, if you feel like you are the chillest person in the room yet feel on edge after drinking coffee, there are a few instances related to genetics variation, metabolization, and the amount/frequency of coffee intake—in which experts say coffee &lt;em data-node-id="16.1"&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; certainly trigger anxiety—even in non-anxious people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Gene Variation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Nehlig, who is also the editor-in-chief of &lt;em data-node-id="18.1"&gt;Epilepsy&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em data-node-id="18.3"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  explains that a particular &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29514871/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29514871/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="genetic variation" data-node-id="18.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;genetic variation&lt;/a&gt; exists that can mess with how your body regulates dopamine and wakefulness, making you more sensitive to caffeine. However, the variation is “quite rare, affecting only about 5 percent of the population, ” she notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;On top of that, having this gene variation also makes you a "slow caffeine metabolizer," Nehlig says—which means your body takes longer to break down caffeine. You would likely only know that you have this genetic variation if you have done genetic testing via your doctor or an at-home genetic testing health kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="metabolization" data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;Metabolization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The metabolization factor, or how fast the body breaks down the caffeine in your coffee, affects your sensitivity to coffee. Usually, the half-life of caffeine is between three and five hours. However, “The population is evenly distributed between fast and slow metabolizers of coffee, and how long the half-life of coffee remains in their system can be a determinant of how sensitive people are to caffeine,” says Nehlig. This is why some people can drink multiple cups of coffee in a short time without issues, while others start feeling jittery or anxious after just one cup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Fast caffeine metabolizers break down caffeine quickly, so they can have two to three cups over six hours without much buildup in their system. On the other hand, slow caffeine metabolizers process caffeine more slowly, so it stays in their system longer. As they continue drinking coffee, the caffeine accumulates, making them more likely to experience side effects like anxiety and jitteriness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="caffeine-consumption-level-and-frequency" data-node-id="23" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;Caffeine Consumption Level And Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The last and most common instance in which coffee can cause non-anxious people anxiety is the amount of caffeine consumption. As a general rule, “If you drink too much coffee or too much caffeine in other forms, then it’s contraindicated for you and you will start raising anxiety,” says Nehlig. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Coffee naturally has a larger concentration of caffeine than some other caffeinated drinks. The exact amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee depends on the coffee variety, region it comes from, brewing method, and serving size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The recommended amount? The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FDA" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="26.1.0"&gt;FDA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cites 400 milligrams per day—which is about four or five cups of coffee—as a safe amount for adults. “In most people, it's just finding the right level under which they have no anxiety,” says Nehlig, who adds that no more than 200 mg per sitting and no more than 400 mg a day of caffeine should be exceeded regardless of the source of caffeine including teas, matcha, sodas, and energy drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="27" class="body-h4 css-lviy4r emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="27.0"&gt;How much caffeine is in these common drinks (12 oz.), according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FDA" data-node-id="27.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="28" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0.0"&gt;Decaf coffee:&lt;/strong&gt; 2 to 15 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.1.0"&gt;Green tea: &lt;/strong&gt;30 to 50 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.2.0"&gt;Soft drinks&lt;/strong&gt;: 23 to 83 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.3.0"&gt;Matcha&lt;/strong&gt;: 35 to 130 mg &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.4.0"&gt;Black tea&lt;/strong&gt;: 25 to 48 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.5"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.5.0"&gt;Energy drinks:&lt;/strong&gt; 80 to 200 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="28.6"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.6.0"&gt;Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;: 113 to 247 mg (depending on brewing method)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Ever wondered why drinking coffee affects you differently than drinking matcha or green tea? The bottom line is that coffee in and of itself is probably not causing your anxiety.

But in practice, both Nehlig and Dr. Sultan say there isn’t enough research to recommend adding L-theanine supplements to coffee for this purpose—mainly because there’s currently no research that proves a benefit, or explores the implications of combining these chemical compounds. “It's true that tea is making you less nervous, but there is twice or even three times less caffeine, which might already be an explanation,” says Nehlig. So, the L-theanine may not have anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Instead, Dr. Sultan recommends drinking L-theanine from sources that naturally contain it already like tea and matcha rather than adding an L-theanine supplement to coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-enjoy-your-coffee-sans-anxiousness" data-node-id="36" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="36.0"&gt;How To Enjoy Your Coffee Sans Anxiousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Our experts reiterate that caffeine itself doesn’t usually cause anxiety but can make it worse if you’re already prone to it. However, if you do think your caffeine intake is bringing out anxiousness for you, consider cutting back or kicking the habit entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If coffee makes you feel jittery, try channeling that energy into movement, like a quick walk. If you’re especially sensitive, Nehlig recommends switching from Robusta (which has twice the caffeine of Arabica) to a lower-caffeine Arabica variety like Bourbon Pointu. And if caffeine still feels like too much, decaf lets you enjoy coffee’s perks without the buzz. Bonus tip: Pair your coffee with food instead of drinking it on an empty stomach to soften the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;You can enjoy your coffee—just tweak your routine to make it work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img data-dynamic-svg="true" src="/_assets/design-tokens/womenshealthmag/static/images/logos/lettermark.f613c4d.svg?primary=%2523000" loading="lazy" data-testid="dynamic-svg-base" alt="Lettermark" class="css-7mevzh ev8dhu50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;div class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doris Alvarez is a freelance writer covering women’s health, lifestyle trends, and cultural issues.

Vitamin A at very high doses — high doses that you would never administer by yourself at home — but high-dose vitamin A administered in the hospital has shown to reduce both mortality and duration and severity of [measles] illness,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of truth in the statement he made is that giving vitamin A in the form of cod liver oil as like a panacea for all the people in Texas ... is unequivocally wrong,” Patel added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cod liver oil as a measles treatment has not been studied, said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/joelbervell/?igsh=ZWd1dTBxMjk5bjYy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Joel Bervell" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/joelbervell/?igsh=ZWd1dTBxMjk5bjYy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Joel Bervell&lt;/a&gt;, a recent medical graduate and medical myth-buster on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the same as vitamin A supplementation,” Bervell explained. “I think the reason why he was talking about cod oil in the first place was it has high levels of vitamin A, but the amount of vitamin A that’s in cod oil can vary widely, and relying on that instead of vaccines can be risky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplementation for children just generally can also be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a blanket statement, I would never give my kids cod liver oil because we know the supplement industry is not very well regulated,” Patel explained. “I don’t like giving my kids any supplements, because the truth is, you have no idea what’s in them.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, taking too much of any vitamin, including vitamin A, can lead to complications and toxicity, Bervell said. “It can cause ... liver damage to fatigue to hair loss and headaches.” According to Texas Public Radio, the hospitalized children who are now being treated for vitamin A toxicity have abnormal liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A also can interact with other medications, which can lead to more problems, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Vitamin A isn’t going to prevent someone from getting the measles, and it’s also not proven to help with symptoms for patients who aren’t hospitalized, according to Patel. Ingesting high amounts of vitamin A or cod liver oil can lead to real health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope RFK knows that what he says is what parents are going to do,” Bervell said. “If they’re believing that either vitamin A or cod oil is a replacement for vaccines, that’s going to do their children, and the rest of communities in these areas, more harm than good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Getting the measles vaccine is the best way to protect yourself from infection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is what actually works when it comes to protecting yourself from the measles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself and your loved ones from measles, your best bet is to get the MMR vaccine if you haven’t already, Patel stressed. The typical guidance is for children to get the first dose of the two-dose shot at 12 months, but children as young as 6 months can get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re in any pocket of the country that has had a measles case, I would 100% get my child vaccinated early if they were over 6 months,” Patel said, adding that she also encourages people to get their kids the shots early if they are traveling internationally somewhere with measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the second dose of the measles vaccine is typically given to children between 4 and 6 years old, you can also get their second dose early as long as it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="at least 28 days" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;at least 28 days&lt;/a&gt; since their first dose, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the first dose, you’re 93% protected against the measles. After the second dose, you’re 97% protected,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults who don’t know their vaccination status or older adults who could have waning measles protection, Patel recommended that you get your titers drawn. This is done via a blood test that measures antibody levels in your blood. You can talk to your primary care doctor about this option to get set up with a test. If your measles antibody levels are low, you can get another MMR shot for protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical experts think there needs to be a larger focus on vaccination by the current administration. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In previous years when we see measles outbreaks, health officials have said we need to have an increase in public health information out there about why people need vaccinations,” Bervell said. “I haven’t seen that to the same degree with this administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. continues to call vaccination a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="personal decision" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e6a46ee4b086a4e8de55cf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;personal decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be making sure that we understand the importance of vaccines right now,” Bervell said, and added that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration need to be more focused on putting accurate information out about why the measles vaccine, specifically, is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jennifer Aniston , Chris Pratt and Kourtney Kardashian are among the Hollywood A-listers to have jumped on the trend since it shot to prominence in the early 2010s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A group of German and Chinese researchers discovered the diet affected the concentration of serotonin — a hormone that can alter mood — in the brain &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Their mating behavior more than compensated for the age-related physiological limitations.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'However, it is currently unclear whether the reduction in serotonin levels is linked to our specific feeding regimen or would also occur with other types of fasting. Future studies will need to clarify this.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite swathes of studies suggesting intermittent fasting — which &lt;span&gt;shot to prominence in the early 2010s — does work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, experts remain divided over its effectiveness and the potential long term health impacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some argue that fasters usually end up consuming a relatively large amount of food in one go, meaning they don't cut back on their calories — a known way of beating the bulge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They even &lt;span&gt;warn that it may &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13210375/Fasting-16-hours-day-RAISES-risk-dying-heart-problems-double-20-year-analysis-finds.html"&gt;raise the risk of strokes, heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; or early death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the new study, one group of male mice undertook an intensive form of intermittent fasting from the age of two months, allowed to eat what they wanted for 24 hours, followed by 24 hours of water only.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other group followed no dietary restrictions. Both were housed together without any contact with females.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They were then introduced to three-month-old females that had been raised without dietary restrictions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite swathes of studies suggesting intermittent fasting — which shot to prominence in the early 2010s — does work, experts remain divided over its effectiveness and the potential long term health impacts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scientists found that among the sexually active male mice, serotonin was present at unusually low levels. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Serotonin relies upon the amino acid tryptophan to be converted by the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But tryptophan can only be obtained through the diet or released via the breakdown of the body's own protein stores, such as those found in muscle tissue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As such, when levels of tryptophan are low, less serotonin will be produced. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Ehninger said: 'The lack of serotonin was clearly a result of fasting. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'These mice were, so to speak, sexually uninhibited, the usual regulatory restraint was diminished.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.03.001"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers also said a similar effect was observed among younger mice who had started intermittent fasting aged two months but had only followed the diet for six months before being introduced to females. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They too, were more sexually active than mice of the same age who followed no dietary restrictions.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the effect was absent in other groups – both young and old – that fasted for only a few weeks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professor Yu Zhou, an expert in neurobiology at Qingdao University, added: 'For intermittent fasting to increase sex drive, it takes some time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Based on our experiments, the minimum duration appears to be somewhere between six weeks and six months.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Ehninger said: 'In view of this, I consider it very plausible that sexual desire in humans can be influenced by fasting — possibly not only in men, but also in women, since serotonin affects their libido as well.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research also comes amid concern about a global sex crisis — or rather, lack of sex crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One recent survey revealed more than a quarter (27 per cent) of Britons are now &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-12752131/The-Great-British-SEXODUS-quarter-Britons-say-theyre-having-sex-used-15-havent-got-frisky-year.html"&gt;having less sex than they used to&lt;/a&gt;, with one in six admitting they haven't got frisky the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a Royal College of Occupational Therapists &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13063789/Britons-having-sex-week-average-one-three-admitting-break-partner-failed-impress-sheets-survey-finds.html"&gt;poll of 2,000 adults last year&lt;/a&gt;, men and women typically have sex 46 times a year — once every eight days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some have far less frequent amorous activity, with a tenth reported having sex less than once a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sex and intimacy have been linked to several health benefits, including improving the condition of your heart, reducing stress and even boosting mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:19:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Food Poisoning While Traveling: What You Should Know - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPbS1RMHR5Smc3NE9HUVZmZXV6dkhxT2owQUNyalJfaDBtX0FlX2R5NjJoNU1Hc0RCTmRDTkVjbTNGd3VaWGFTNDhyY2NFXzNUeENEM19ibHdfS294blhyRTEzajgyRE5aUVEwMnFiM0l1RS1vRWlkVllhMld2NV9SNHo5Um9leTAzdm9BTmEzTlZQZ01l?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Two cases involving possible food poisoning among tourists have raised concerns about what travelers can do to prevent and treat food-borne illnesses — not just during off-the-beaten-path adventures, but in and around resorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;While the cause of the recent &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/sport/miller-gardner-death-investigation-spt/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of Miller Gardner, the 14-year-old son of the former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, has not been confirmed, Miller, along with other members of the Gardner family, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/teen-son-ex-yankees-star-brett-gardner-not-die-asphyxia-costa-rica-off-rcna198037" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;is reported to have experienced gastrointestinal distress after eating a meal while on vacation in Costa Rica.&lt;/a&gt; And a lawsuit filed this year in Toronto in connection with the food poisoning-related deaths in 2023 of 8-year-old Stephen Gougeon and his mother, April, alleges, among other things, that the Dominican Republic resort where they stayed did not take sufficient care in food handling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In general, gastrointestinal illnesses among tourists — &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/preparing/travelers-diarrhea" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;travelers’ diarrhea and food poisoning&lt;/a&gt; — is especially likely to occur in countries where the water supply is unsafe. But there are also many cases of food poisoning, and hundreds of deaths, in the United States every year, and these infections can occur anywhere there are lapses in how food is handled. Raw or undercooked meat, fish and shellfish can be contaminated, and the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/foods/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s list of high-risk foods&lt;/a&gt; includes raw eggs and unpasteurized milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Travel presents additional concerns. “People may be in places where the tap water is not necessarily safe, and they don’t have control over how food is prepared or handled,” said &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.adamratnermd.com/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Adam Ratner&lt;/a&gt;, director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://nyulangone.org/locations/hassenfeld-childrens-hospital" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone&lt;/a&gt; in New York. “When you’re home, you have some control, and you have U.S. and local health department standards. It can be harder to assess safety somewhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Parents should be especially vigilant. Babies and young children are vulnerable to dehydration, which is generally the most dangerous aspect of gastrointestinal illnesses; other groups at high risk include pregnant women, older people and anyone who is immunocompromised. But even younger adults and adolescents may not realize how serious the symptoms of food poisoning can be, and when it is important to get medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;abbr class="drop-cap color-accent font-accent"&gt;L&lt;/abbr&gt;ess than a year&lt;/strong&gt; after COVID-19 upended life as we know it and killed the first of what would become more than 7 million people, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19" aria-label="FDA"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; and other regulators around the world authorized the first mRNA vaccine. Co-developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, the vaccine was based on new biotechnology that uses the body’s own machinery to produce disease-fighting antibodies. Authorization for a second mRNA vaccine from Moderna followed shortly after. The speed with which they were developed and distributed was unprecedented; The mumps vaccine had taken four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed was only possible thanks to the more than $330 million in federal NIH grants that had supported three decades of underlying research into mRNA. Much of the heavy lifting of discovery and even testing had been done by the time the Biden and Trump Administrations &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9975718/#:~:text=The%20US%20government%20invested%20at,the%20pandemic%20through%20March%202022." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9975718/#:~:text=The%20US%20government%20invested%20at,the%20pandemic%20through%20March%202022." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9975718/#:~:text=The%20US%20government%20invested%20at,the%20pandemic%20through%20March%202022." aria-label="spent over"&gt;spent over&lt;/a&gt; $30 billion to develop, purchase and distribute the vaccines. Today underlying mRNA technology, which helped save &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/" aria-label="millions of lives"&gt;millions of lives&lt;/a&gt;, prevent hospitalizations and mitigate instances of long Covid, is now also being used to tackle a wide range of diseases — bird flu, cancer, heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite those COVID successes — and Trump’s &lt;a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/trump-takes-credit-for-covid-19-vaccine-i-hope-everyone-remembers" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.fox29.com/news/trump-takes-credit-for-covid-19-vaccine-i-hope-everyone-remembers" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.fox29.com/news/trump-takes-credit-for-covid-19-vaccine-i-hope-everyone-remembers" aria-label="ongoing attempts for take credit for them"&gt;ongoing attempts for take credit for them&lt;/a&gt; — the president’s administration and base are now attacking mRNA. And they’re doing it in a way that might threaten not only next-generation vaccines for the pandemics to come, but U.S. biotechnology leadership in a market estimated to be worth almost $20 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misinformation about mRNA vaccines is widespread, false claims that they are deadly, change people’s DNA or somehow enable mind control. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/myths-facts.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/myths-facts.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/myths-facts.html" aria-label="though widely debunked"&gt;though widely debunked&lt;/a&gt;, these conspiracies have inspired concerted efforts around the country to end federal funding for the development of vaccines and other treatments based on mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kentucky lawmakers don’t want mRNA vaccines given to minors. Idaho legislators want to ban their use for the next 10 years; Texas legislators want to ban them entirely. And, under the leadership of one of the &lt;a href="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" aria-label="biggest spreaders of mRNA vaccine misinformation"&gt;biggest spreaders of mRNA vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has begun a review of its investments in related vaccine research as part of &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/03/27/rfk-jrs-10000-health-job-cuts-cdc-fda-medicare-and-medicaid-services-reportedly-affected/" target="_self" class="color-link" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/03/27/rfk-jrs-10000-health-job-cuts-cdc-fda-medicare-and-medicaid-services-reportedly-affected/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/03/27/rfk-jrs-10000-health-job-cuts-cdc-fda-medicare-and-medicaid-services-reportedly-affected/" aria-label="a looming gutting of the Department of Health and Human Services"&gt;a looming gutting of the Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; that will see over 10,000 jobs cut in addition to 10,000 workers who’ve already taken a voluntary layoff. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, told &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; that efforts to pull funding for mRNA vaccine research would hamstring scientists preparing for outbreaks of new diseases with pandemic risk like avian flu. “Removing federal funding of mRNA vaccine technology would compromise pandemic preparedness greatly,” he said&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“There are multiple projects aimed at using this vaccine platform against potential pandemic threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the American biotech industry, which currently has the lead in a market that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/mrna-vaccines-and-therapeutics-market-size-to-reach-usd-72-7-billion-by-2032-augmented-by-advancements-in-personalized-medicine" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.biospace.com/mrna-vaccines-and-therapeutics-market-size-to-reach-usd-72-7-billion-by-2032-augmented-by-advancements-in-personalized-medicine" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.biospace.com/mrna-vaccines-and-therapeutics-market-size-to-reach-usd-72-7-billion-by-2032-augmented-by-advancements-in-personalized-medicine" aria-label="could be worth"&gt;could be worth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; over $70 billion by 2032, that’s bad news. Already, the Department of Health and Human Services is said to be reevaluating a $590 million contract with Moderna to develop vaccines against bird flu and other flu viruses with pandemic potential. The NIH has already terminated one grant &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00828-3" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00828-3" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00828-3" aria-label="studying the immune effects of mRNA vaccines"&gt;studying the immune effects of mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and researchers fear more cuts will follow. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If threats to mRNA technology from American lawmakers escalate and slow its development, it could lead to a loss of American leadership in pharmaceuticals as a whole, Pitchbook Analyst Kaz Helal told &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;. Right now, he explained, “if the FDA approves, the world follows.” But should the U.S. slow or abandon entirely the development of new vaccines, that development will almost certainly continue abroad in Europe or China. That, Helal said, “might be a long-term disaster for the U.S.” diminishing its stature and power in biotech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes mRNA therapies so promising is exactly why they were so successful in their first use against COVID 19: They can be created or adjusted and scaled far more quickly than conventional vaccines. mRNA therapies are simply faster and cheaper to produce than antibodies or other proteins. And they don’t remain in the body for very long, reducing the risk of side effects. They work by injecting bits of mRNA, which contain genetic instructions for your body to make a particular protein. In vaccines, they stimulate your immune system to produce antibodies against disease, elegantly turning the human body into a factory for the medicine that heals it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="embed-base rule-embed color-accent border-solid weight-light"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal government recognized the promise of mRNA years ago, and has funded several programs working on next generation vaccines for Covid and related coronaviruses, as well as flu viruses, that could emerge as pandemic threats. The NIH has been funding projects to develop mRNA vaccines and treatments for diseases like HIV, Oropouche fever, and cancer. Trump’s first administration invested in developing better vaccines with an &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-modernizing-influenza-vaccines-united-states-promote-national-security-public-health/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-modernizing-influenza-vaccines-united-states-promote-national-security-public-health/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-modernizing-influenza-vaccines-united-states-promote-national-security-public-health/" aria-label="executive order"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; that led to the funding for mRNA vaccines. But his second now threatens to slow or even stop that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will directly impact entrepreneurs building companies off the government’s research. Jacob Glanville, CEO of Centivax, which is developing a universal flu vaccine using mRNA technology, depends in part on funding from the NIH. He told &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; his company could continue its work without federal support, but much more slowly, forfeiting the rapid progress that was so crucial during COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other mRNA biotechs may not be so lucky. Helal noted that if NIH decides to stop funding mRNA research, venture emerging from smaller universities without the large endowments or industry connections of places like Stanford and Harvard will inevitably struggle — ultimately leading to fewer new companies, and fewer advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlash against mRNA vaccines will likely impact other therapies being developed from the same science. A recent study found that an mRNA treatment helped keep &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/can-mrna-vaccines-fight-pancreatic-cancer-msk-clinical-researchers-are-trying-find-out" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.mskcc.org/news/can-mrna-vaccines-fight-pancreatic-cancer-msk-clinical-researchers-are-trying-find-out" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.mskcc.org/news/can-mrna-vaccines-fight-pancreatic-cancer-msk-clinical-researchers-are-trying-find-out" aria-label="pancreatic cancer"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; from returning after surgery. An mRNA therapeutic co-developed by Merck and Moderna &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-And-Merck-Announce-mRNA-4157-V940-In-Combination-with-KeytrudaR-Pembrolizumab-Demonstrated-Continued-Improvement-in-Recurrence-Free-Survival-and-Distant-Metastasis-Free-Survival-in-Patients-with-High-Risk-Stage-IIIIV-Melanoma-Following-Comple/default.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-And-Merck-Announce-mRNA-4157-V940-In-Combination-with-KeytrudaR-Pembrolizumab-Demonstrated-Continued-Improvement-in-Recurrence-Free-Survival-and-Distant-Metastasis-Free-Survival-in-Patients-with-High-Risk-Stage-IIIIV-Melanoma-Following-Comple/default.aspx" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-And-Merck-Announce-mRNA-4157-V940-In-Combination-with-KeytrudaR-Pembrolizumab-Demonstrated-Continued-Improvement-in-Recurrence-Free-Survival-and-Distant-Metastasis-Free-Survival-in-Patients-with-High-Risk-Stage-IIIIV-Melanoma-Following-Comple/default.aspx" aria-label="significantly improved"&gt;significantly improved&lt;/a&gt; survival rates among patients with advanced skin cancer. Astrazeneca and Moderna have seen &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08852-4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08852-4" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08852-4" aria-label="positive results"&gt;positive results&lt;/a&gt; in an mRNA drug they’re co-developing that regenerates damaged tissue in the heart. If a bill pending in the Texas legislature were to pass, all these medicines &lt;a href="https://kerrcountylead.com/virdell-to-lead-the-effort-to-ban-mrna-vaccines-in-texas/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://kerrcountylead.com/virdell-to-lead-the-effort-to-ban-mrna-vaccines-in-texas/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://kerrcountylead.com/virdell-to-lead-the-effort-to-ban-mrna-vaccines-in-texas/" aria-label="would be banned"&gt;would be banned&lt;/a&gt; within the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the U.S. pulls support for mRNA therapy development, it likely won’t impact drugs that are already undergoing clinical trials, Helal said, because drugmakers will simply sell them in Asia and Europe. Big pharma companies could also shift mRNA development to friendlier places like Denmark or Germany, and just wait four years for the next administration to see if things change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But four years is a long time — potentially long enough to seriously damage American biotech’s lead. “Europe will be a solution,” Helal said. “But the risk is that it will challenge U.S. dominance in terms of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, colon cancer has a 90% survival rate when detected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding your risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer can affect anyone, but certain factors can increase your risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; Most cases occur in individuals aged 50 and older.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family history:&lt;/strong&gt; A family history of colon cancer or polyps can increase your risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal history:&lt;/strong&gt; Previous polyps or inflammatory bowel disease heighten your risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Diets high in red and processed meats, smoking, heavy alcohol use and lack of physical activity can contribute to an increased risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just older adults who need to be vigilant. Colorectal cancer incidence has been steadily increasing in younger Americans for the last several decades, with the sharpest rise seen in the incidence of rectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, 11% of all colon cancer and 15% of all rectal cancer diagnoses were estimated to occur in individuals under age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Waiting for symptoms is too late," said Christine Hachem, M.D., interim medical director of gastroenterology and digestive health for Intermountain Health. "Screening occurs when you have no symptoms and feel well. Early detection is critical to catching colorectal cancer and saving lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rise is alarming because younger patients often have more advanced cases by the time they're diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors contributing to this trend may include environmental exposures, dietary habits, and sporadic genetic mutations, Hachem said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Younger individuals face unique barriers when it comes to colon cancer screenings, such as a lack of awareness about the need for screening, fear or discomfort associated with the procedure and challenges in navigating the healthcare system," said Priyanka Patel, M.D., gastroenterologist for Intermountain Health. "It's crucial for everyone, regardless of age, to understand their personal risk factors and discuss them with their healthcare provider to determine the best screening plan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated national guidelines make it possible for more people to be screened with a colonoscopy and stool-based testing starting at age 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonoscopies are considered the gold standard for colon cancer detection. It not only detects abnormalities, but removes precancerous lesions. Intermountain Health makes it easier to schedule a colonoscopy with an online system, ensuring you have access to this vital screening option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Issara/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most patients a colonoscopy is then only needed once every 10 years, or once every five years if your doctor determines you have an increased risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier screening may be recommended for anyone with a personal history of polyps or family history of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have inflammatory bowel disease (with Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis) or other chronic conditions that affect the gastrointestinal tract, talk with your doctor or a gastrointestinal specialist to determine when and how often you should be screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't delay your screenings," Hachem said. "It could save your life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other easy and convenient screening options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermountain Health offers home-based tests that are both effective and convenient, allowing you to get what you need, when you need it, without leaving your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who are 45 to 75 years old with average risk may qualify for Intermountain's on-demand colon cancer screening kits. This is an option that allows you to get a test kit in the mail and send it back to the lab for testing without the need for an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple, non-invasive test detects hidden blood in the stool, an early sign of colon cancer. You can complete it at home, and if the results are positive or abnormal, a follow-up colonoscopy may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cologuard:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the FIT with a DNA test, Cologuard detects abnormal DNA markers in stool samples. It's also non-invasive and can be done at home. A positive or abnormal result will require a follow-up colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why choose home-based tests?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home-based tests like FIT and Cologuard offer several advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convenience:&lt;/strong&gt; Complete the test at home without a doctor's visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive:&lt;/strong&gt; No preparation or sedation required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Ideal for those who may have difficulty scheduling or accessing colonoscopy appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Act today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding your risks and exploring your screening options are vital steps in preventing colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are 45 or older, you can order an at-home colon cancer screening kit to have a test kit mailed to you without needing a doctor's visit. If you have risk factors, like a family or personal history of colon cancer or polyps, talk to your healthcare provider about getting screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about Intermountain Health's on-demand services, &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/virtual-care/on-demand" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To schedule a colonoscopy, or to find a physician &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/gastroenterology/colon-cancer-screening?utm_source=WebPage&amp;amp;utm_medium=NewsMedia&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2025&amp;amp;utm_id=IH_ColonCancer&amp;amp;utm_content=Canyons" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/gastroenterology/colon-cancer-screening" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;www.IntermountainHealthcare.org/colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rewards received may be considered income and subject to tax.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

But during the pandemic that progress was reversed, and the &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/01/as-texas-outbreak-grows-californias-measles-vaccination-rate-struggles-to-recover-after-pandemic/"&gt;recovery since then has been slow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rates around the Bay Area continue to be higher than the state overall, in Santa Cruz County just over 91% of kindergarten students had received the recommended doses of the vaccine that provides immunity to the measles virus, &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/2023-2024KindergartenReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to data released this month from the California Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonoma County is right at the threshold, but every other Bay Area county has higher than the statewide vaccination rate, though some local counties have increased their rates in the past two years, others have dropped. Alameda county has seen MMR vaccine rates drop nearly a percentage point in two years, while rates in San Francisco and Contra Costa have increased the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 2023-2024 school year, California schools reported that 96.2% of kindergarten students were vaccinated against the measles — a slight drop from the previous school year, when it was 96.5%, and lower than two years before when it was 96.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California’s rates are still well above the nationwide average, which was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to have dropped to 92.7% for this past school year&lt;/a&gt;. The recommended threshold for vaccination coverage to prevent a measles outbreak is 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santa Cruz County deputy public health officer Dr. Karissa LeClair Cortez said numbers for the current school year in the county indicate another slight drop, to 91.1%, though data for all counties is not yet available from the California Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For any schools that have more than 10% of students that are conditionally admitted or overdue for immunizations, we reach out to those schools and actually do visits there to provide guidance, resources and support,” LeClair Cortez said. She also said Santa Cruz County has more students doing independent study, who aren’t required to get vaccinated, than other nearby counties, which could contribute to the low rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do worry that children and the community are at risk because of these low vaccination rates,” LeClair Cortez said. “We know that it’s out there, it’s a matter of when it will come to our local community, unfortunately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been over five years since the county’s last measles case, in 2019, but with measles spreading quickly in several active outbreaks around the country, the chances of it finding its way there are higher now. And there is an ever-present risk of travelers bringing it back from places where it has yet to be eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2014, there was a serious measles outbreak that started at Disneyland. Over 100 cases were associated with that outbreak, the vast majority among the unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response to the Disneyland outbreak contributed to a steep increase in vaccination rates among California kindergartners over the following years. Several laws, &lt;a href="https://archive.senate.ca.gov/member-archives/2017-18/richard-pan-d-district-06" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;many authored by former state senator Dr. Richard Pan&lt;/a&gt;, encouraged vaccination and limited families’ legal recourses for avoiding otherwise-mandatory vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccination rate statewide was 96.5% the year the pandemic hit, up from the low 90’s in the early 2010’s. Then schools closed, and the pandemic disrupted the health care system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of all the vaccine preventable diseases, measles is kind of the canary in the coal mine, because it’s the most contagious of all of them,” Pan said. He is now a lecturer of public health and health policy in the Department of Public Health Sciences at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of measles cases were reported each year before the vaccine was introduced, leading to tends of thousands of hospitalizations, and 400-500 deaths a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after decades of vaccination campaigns, in 2000 measles was declared eliminated in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m really concerned that we’re going to lose that measles elimination status,” Pan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s outbreak in Texas has contributed to two measles deaths, one confirmed and one under investigation still, the first in the country in over a decade. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Over 300 cases are associated with the Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt; so far, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kansas-measles-cases-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;23 reported in Kansas in recent days&lt;/a&gt;, and 10 in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all these cases circulating, “then what happens is the wildfire catches,” Pan said. To avoid a measles wildfire growing out of control “you clear the brush, you protect zones, that’s what vaccination is about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several sparks have landed in California so far this year, with &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;eight measles cases reported already, according to this week’s update from the state health department&lt;/a&gt;. All the reported cases have been related to travel, and none have yet to lead to local spread, though officials reported possible exposures at Los Angeles International Airport early this month, and in &lt;a href="https://edsource.org/updates/measles-exposure-possible-at-tuolumne-county-high-school" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a high school and emergency room in Tuolumne County&lt;/a&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the long run, people realize the value of vaccination,” Pan said. “The problem is, how many people have to die or become disabled before that message finally sinks in?”&lt;/p&gt;

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In news that will come as no surprise to many, scientists have now confirmed that men really aren't as good at listening as women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have discovered that men have significantly less sensitive hearing than women across all frequencies and populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it could go some way to explaining why they didn't hear the request for dishes to be done, or for the bins to be taken out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An international team of scientists conducted hearing tests for 450 individuals across 13 global populations, including those in Ecuador, England, Gabon, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/south_africa/index.html" id="mol-c3837c90-0bd1-11f0-adc9-d5e987cbff89"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and Uzbekistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They investigated the sensitivity of the cochlea within the ear, looking at how it transmitted brain signals in response to different amplitudes and frequencies of sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is already well known that people generally have better hearing in their right ear, compared with their left, and that hearing usually declines with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they were surprised by their findings on the effects of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis revealed that hearing is more influenced by sex than age, with women showing an average of two decibels more sensitive hearing than men across all the populations studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study could go some way to explaining the root of many domestic disputes - that men 'simply didn't hear' a request to do chores (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this is generally considered to be a very subtle difference in loudness, the researchers said it is significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Turi King, co-author from the University of Bath, said: 'We were surprised to find that women had two decibels more sensitive hearing across all the populations we measured, and this accounted for most of the variations between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could be due to different exposure to hormones during development in the womb, due to men and women having slight structural differences in cochlear anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As well as having higher hearing sensitivity, women also perform better in other hearing tests and speech perception, indicating that their brains are also better at processing the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We don't really know why this might be but given the detrimental effect of noise on overall health such as sleep quality and increased cardiovascular disease, having more sensitive hearing in noisy environments may not always be a good thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found a person's environment was the second most significant influence on their hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living in forest areas had the highest hearing sensitivity and those living at high altitudes had the lowest, the team discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suggest that people living in forests could have higher sensitivity because they've adapted to an environment with lots of non-human sounds, where vigilance is essential for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers said men have slight differences in the structural anatomy of their cochlear compared to women, which could go some way to explaining the findings (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Or, it could be due to being exposed to lower levels of pollution, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living at higher altitudes may have reduced sensitivity due to a number of reasons including the impact of lower atmospheric pressure on measurements, potential sound reduction in high altitude environments or physiological adaptations to lower oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found a difference between urban and rural populations, with those living in cities having a shift towards higher frequencies, possibly due to filtering out low frequency traffic noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Patricia Balaresque, who led the study at the Centre for Biodiversity and Environmental Research in Toulouse, France, said: 'Our findings challenge existing assumptions and highlight the need to consider both biological and environmental factors when studying hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Identifying drivers behind natural hearing variation will improve our understanding of hearing loss and individual differences in noise tolerance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings were published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;Scientific Reports.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox

think they are smarter than their peers, even when compared to women whose grades prove they are just as smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at Arizona State University (ASU) made the discovery after asking college students enrolled in a 250 strong biology course about their intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, students were asked to estimate their own intelligence compared to everyone in the class as well as the student they worked most closely with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts were surprised to find that women were far more likely to underestimate their own intelligence than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When comparing a female and a male student, both with a grade point average of 3.3, the male student is likely to say he is smarter than 66 percent of the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A female student is likely to say she is smarter than only 54 percent of the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, when asked whether they are smarter than the person they worked most with in class, the pattern continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Male students are 3.2 times more likely than females to say they are smarter than the person they are working with, regardless of whether their class partners are men or women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar

urged the public to add a portion of yoghurt to their daily diet to slash their risk of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to oncologist Professor Justin Stebbing, the dairy favourite helps protect against cancer-causing bacteria in the gut, reducing the risk of the disease by up to 20 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a consultant oncologist, many people have asked me how their risk can be reduced,' he said, in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The emerging evidence suggests that regular yoghurt consumption may have a protective effect against certain aggressive forms of colorectal cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, not all yoghurts offer the same benefits, he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Different fermentation processes can result in varying levels of beneficial bacteria, so look for yoghurts with live cultures,' Prof Stebbing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that plain, unsweetened and full-fat types tend to be higher in filling protein and lower in sugar, as well as additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Stebbing's advice follows&lt;span&gt; impressive research published last month that found those who ate at least two servings of yoghurt per week over the course of three decades were a fifth less likely to get a certain type of bowel cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top cancer specialist has urged the public to include a portion of yoghurt in their daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Specifically, they had a reduced chance of developing tumours caused by Bifidobacterium, a type of bacteria that helps digest fibre and ward off infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, excess levels can lead to inflammation in the bowel (also called colon), which damages cells and causes them to grow out of control, resulting in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This type of bowel cancer has one of the lowest survival rates, according to Prof Stebbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe that the abundance of other healthy microbes in yoghurt may strengthen the barrier of the gut, warding off excess Bifidobacterium that could lead to tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers, from Harvard university, found no link between yogurt and reduced risk of bowel cancers caused by other factors such as genes, obesity and chemical exposure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study, which involved more than 130,000 people, is not the first to identify a link between dairy products and bowel cancer protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;British research published in January found that increasing daily milk intake by as little as one glass a day could significantly lower the likelihood of developing bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers collected data from over 542,000 women and discovered those who consumed the equivalent of one large glass of milk a day had a 17 per cent lower risk of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They theorised that the benefit may also lie with dairy's influence on healthy gut bugs, which could be explained by the high quantity of calcium within it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Calcium may help protect against cancer by binding to potentially harmful substances in the gut and promoting the death of abnormal cells,' Prof Stebbing explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Cancer Research UK data, 54 percent of all bowel cancers could be prevented by living a healthier lifestyle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prof Stebbing's recommendations come amid a global epidemic in bowel cancers among under 50 year-olds — many of who are otherwise fit and healthy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent review of 50 nations found cases in the under 50s were on the rise in over half of all nations surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Globally, the number of younger patients with the disease has jumped 50 per cent  over the past 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;England was also found to have one of the fastest rises globally with the rate of the disease growing an average of 3.6 per cent each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts aren't entirely sure why the rise exists, but they suspect poor diet, including the increased popularity of ultra-processed foods, and a lack of exercise could be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, nearly 45,000 Brits are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter what age you are or how tough your exercise plan is – whatever physical activity you are doing is probably helping your brain, according to the largest and most comprehensive 'umbrella' review to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the massive data crunch, children and adolescents experienced the greatest benefits from exercise in memory, while the highest gains in executive function, which relates to planning and problem-solving, were seen in people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="156536" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when considering cognition in general, every age group showed similar results. What's more, those benefits did not differ based on exercise intensity, duration, or session frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even video games that require physical movement showed positive effects on the brain. In fact, some of the best outcomes on cognition and memory were attributed to 'exergames', such as Pokemon Go, as well as mind-body activities, like Tai Chi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is an encouraging finding, as it suggests that engaging, low-impact activities can offer real cognitive benefits," &lt;a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/media-centre/Releases/2025/exercise-of-any-kind-boosts-brainpower-at-any-age/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author and health researcher Ben Singh from the University of South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most forms of exercise appear effective," SIngh and his team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;, "including light-intensity activities, exergaming, and mind-body practices such as yoga and Tai Chi, making exercise an accessible and versatile intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xtAZpskai0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-55895-0_11"&gt;meta-meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; covers 133 systematic reviews, encompassing 2,724 randomized controlled trials and more than a quarter of a million participants. It brings together an incredible amount of information to explore the relationship between exercise and cognition like never before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, numerous studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-30-minutes-of-exercise-does-something-wonderful-for-your-brain"&gt;even short bouts of physical exercise&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-few-minutes-of-exercise-today-could-do-wonders-for-your-brain-tomorrow"&gt;do wonders&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/regular-exercise-is-linked-to-larger-brain-volume-in-memory-and-learning-regions"&gt;memory and learning&lt;/a&gt; in the short term, and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-boost-linked-to-exercise-can-last-several-years-scientists-find"&gt;in the long run&lt;/a&gt; as well. In the past, however, reviews have tended to focus on how certain types of activity, like high-intensity or low-intensity exercise, might impact specific individuals, such as older adults, children, or those with cognitive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-boosts-cognition-for-people-with-adhd-study-reveals"&gt;disorders&lt;/a&gt; or neurological &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-much-weekly-exercise-can-slash-your-dementia-risk-by-41-percent"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While each of these reviews has provided valuable insight into the impact that exercise can have on cognitive function and memory," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors of the new meta- &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="156536" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, "…there is a need to comprehensively evaluate the impact of all exercises on general cognition, memory, and executive function across all populations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team could only identify &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01554-4"&gt;one other umbrella review&lt;/a&gt; out there, and it focused only on healthy individuals, finding the effects of exercise on cognition were inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new review considers both healthy and unhealthy participants of all ages who were included in randomized controlled trials. These trials are designed to reveal real effects, not just associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Singh and his colleagues reviewed 107 meta-analyses, they found exercise significantly improved general cognition, and this was true across all age groups and exercise modalities. Only when they split cognition into memory and executive function did they start noticing differences between these subgroups and modalities of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best cognitve outcomes, for instance, were associated with exercises that place emphasis on complex movement patterns, like yoga, Tai Chi, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_game"&gt;exergames&lt;/a&gt;. These are low-intensity exercises, and yet they could be giving our brain a unique workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the umbrella review admit that many trials they included assessed cognition in a way that looks for impairment rather than assessing variation between individual levels of cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the current results are 'ceiling effects'. In other words, some individuals could benefit more from exercise, but all individuals show improvements up to a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This review provides robust evidence for healthcare practitioners to confidently recommend exercise as an effective intervention for enhancing general cognition, memory, and executive function in patients of all ages and health statuses," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2024-108589"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors of the umbrella review.&lt;/p&gt;

From Google DeepMind, and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1923-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, it uses artificial intelligence to figure out a protein’s 3D structure. The technology has already been used to solve fundamental questions in biology, awarded the Nobel prize (in chemistry – to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper) and revolutionised drug discovery. Like most AI, it’s only getting better – and just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A protein’s structure gives us clues about its function, and helps us design new drugs. AlphaFold, which was &lt;a href="https://www.rcsb.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trained&lt;/a&gt; on a huge database of experimentally solved structures called the Protein Data Bank, predicts a protein’s structure based on its amino acid sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the past, the first step would be to produce a vast amount of protein – using litres of a bacterium, or a virus. You’d &lt;em&gt;pray &lt;/em&gt;for the protein to assemble into a crystal lattice (notoriously difficult), and then fire high-energy X-rays at it. This is called X-ray crystallography, and it could take years. Now, AlphaFold can do it in minutes (and a hell of a lot more cheaply, too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;When AlphaFold competed at a protein structure-solving &lt;a href="https://predictioncenter.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, it was so good that some accused the AlphaFold team of cheating. At its first appearance, AlphaFold became the state of the art. Now, there are approximately 250,000,000 protein structures in the AlphaFold database, which has been used by almost 2 million people from 190 countries – many more people than can do X-ray crystallography!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;I did my PhD on cancer biology. I would have loved to solve the structure of the protein I worked on. Maybe I could have even used it to make a new drug. Now, I can go to the &lt;a href="https://alphafoldserver.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;AlphaFold server&lt;/a&gt; and produce a structure in five minutes that would have consumed my whole PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Pauline Lascaux, a molecular and structural biologist at the University of Oxford, said that AlphaFold was central to her &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00911-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt;, which discovered a new way that cells repair DNA, and that more than 90% of the studies she reviews are citing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8072fff0-011e-478b-9806-217adef6217e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element  element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘The technology has already been used to solve fundamental questions in biology, awarded the Nobel Prize, and revolutionised drug discovery.’&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: EMBL-EBI/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;So what does drug discovery with AlphaFold look like? In this &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn6354" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent Science study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used AlphaFold to predict the structure of the serotonin receptor, which controls mood. Through &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; testing (on computers) they tested which of 1.6bn (!) molecules could bind the AlphaFold structure. What they found was a series of molecules that bound much more tightly than drugs generated via the conventional – experimental – approach, which could be new drugs for mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;AlphaFold has only been around since 2020, but its impact has been meteoric. Here are the top three discoveries enabled by AlphaFold so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Solving a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm9326" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;decades-old problem&lt;/a&gt;: the structure of the nuclear pore complex, one of the biggest structures in the cell. This complex is the guardian of entry to the nucleus, which holds the cell’s DNA. It’s implicated in cancer, ageing and neurodegeneration – and now we know what it looks like at the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Finding a new liver cancer drug. In a lab (not in patients), the drug, which &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/SC/D2SC05709C" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; the cancer protein &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/SC/D2SC05709C%20CDK20" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDK20&lt;/a&gt;, prevented liver cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Helping to design a “molecular syringe”, which delivers a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05870-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;therapeutic protein payload&lt;/a&gt; into human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There are companies built on AlphaFold, too. If AlphaFold is solving the lock, then &lt;a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaproteo-generates-novel-proteins-for-biology-and-health-research/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;AlphaProteo&lt;/a&gt; provides the key. AlphaProteo uses AlphaFold’s structures to design molecules that can bind to and modulate other proteins. This has been used to generate molecules that have never been made before – to target Covid-19, cancer and autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Also from DeepMind, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7492" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;AlphaMissense&lt;/a&gt; tackles the problem of missense mutations – minor changes to genes, with uncertain functional impact. Despite their prevalence, we only know whether about 2% of these changes are pathogenic. AlphaMissense models the structure of the mutations using AlphaFold: if the protein structure changes, it’s probably pathogenic. This could transform the diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;We don’t know yet whether drugs designed using AlphaFold will pass successfully through clinical trials, and none have been tested in humans yet – only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the future, AlphaFold could enable new medicines to be discovered by individuals, could find drugs for undruggable targets, and could unlock the secrets of molecular life. (Just the other day, AlphaFold &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01093-6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;helped to solve&lt;/a&gt; the structure of the sperm-egg bridge that forms during fertilisation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;If the first generation of drug discovery was the nature generation, which gave us aspirin (from willow tree bark), and the second was the biotech generation, which gave us Ozempic, then we’ve now moved to the third generation: the AI generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNMWI0aThhVnA4YUNoLUNCRUtkRlg5SUxMOVlycUltNXpNWHQyNjFlRFVkOFF4MlhnNXI2UWZfWllZS2x2cXVzbUZQM2VxY0hiSUtXVFQzeG1vMTZLU0Ewb0FqRk9IWEZLUmh3SjRLVzhyT1dTVk12VGpaX0hoZzNSU00tdVhOS0ZEMjY5Um1XOU80RGVUYU1YQmRmNmQtY21TSERfbnVTWldiSzQ</guid></item><item><title>Doctor didn't seek help for one, easy-to-dismiss symptom...it was cancer that killed him in 3 weeks - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxONFFFU2N3TGVQSUdpMHNjS1lySHRWdVduUUJpeFdUYWJrVFV3Mkp0clZMbFRTazA1Wkl0SHRoazJmZVJzcy11c2lvQnZtX0xIM1M4NzR3MFk2RWtQaDIzZVNxdEJvQVp2cXdqYzhoRWxIYm5ONGIxb0x6RVdrNHBzcUpHMFJCdUxDamUyNDRwODBXNzlVVFhfODV0dVZfRUdwTnMw0gGoAUFVX3lxTFB5Z3VKMWhuWFpxMWNZdWFWUC1VZ09EWjIzcklLMGVwLWZfdTlac0pIYzR2aXNSSzFlZVdlU3d0NWRrRzM1M09iUTFyMGJXcmJOOHJpRUg3U3lETy0yYkZGdGRtUTFmNVNPZ19wQnlJZUIxQ3lSZ05KQVhCWWxFcGdSN0tidWZJTjhmLVFGMDdKNVppTzE1bTFybGJ0MVotUXZsWGoxWTNxVw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman whose 'fit and healthy' husband died just three weeks after a devastating &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-7f0d9880-0bbc-11f0-88c0-cb8b99931380"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; diagnosis has urged others never to ignore unusual symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thelma Ainsworth, 50, said her husband Jonathan — a 59 year-old doctor and father of their two children — waited several months before seeking medical advice for his bout of stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By that point, it was too late. Doctors discovered bile duct cancer that had 'spread everywhere'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was more advanced than we could possibly imagine,' said Ms Ainsworth, a London-based lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even though Jonathan was a doctor, he didn’t get checked immediately, he waited until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once you know that there’s something wrong, get yourself checked out as soon as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The earliest signs that something was wrong began in 2019, when Mr Ainsworth — a keen runner who was 'always training' — started complaining of a pain in his stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He did little about it for several months, until he noticed he had begun to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-b7098980-0bbf-11f0-88c0-cb8b99931380"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jonathan Ainsworth, 59, was 'fit and healthy' and 'always running and training' before he was diagnosed with deadly bile duct cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When he eventually spoke to a doctor, he was referred for a scan which revealed severe inflammation in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While waiting for the referral, the infectious disease specialist decided to take his own bloods, with the results showing something 'wasn't right'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He went off to St Mary’s Hospital and they said that he had cancer,' said Ms Ainsworth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In October 2019, doctors revealed he had bile duct cancer, which affects around 3,000 people in the UK every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease impacts the tubes in the digestive system that carry bile; a fluid that helps the body digest food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 20 and 25 per cent of those diagnosed at the earliest stages will survive for more than five years, compared to between two and five per cent of those who are diagnosed later, when the cancer has spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the position of the bile ducts within the body, it easily migrates to other nearby organs, like the pancreas and the bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bile duct cancer can be symptomless, particularly in its earliest stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when it does cause problems, signs include changes to your bowel habits, itchy skin, high temperature, abdominal pain and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite being a doctor, he left it 'too late' to seek medical help for his stomach pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;His widow, Thelma Ainsworth, spent years struck with guilt about not pushing her husband to see a doctor sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Some also notice yellowing of the skin and the white of the eyes — known medically as jaundice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within three weeks of Mr Ainsworth's diagnosis he had 'gone', leaving her widowed with two young children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soon afterwards, she found that she started blaming herself, believing it was her fault for her husband's untimely death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since the diagnosis and for many months, maybe years afterwards, I blamed myself,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[I thought] that it was somehow my fault...because I didn’t get him to check himself out.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, it 'all came to a head' while she was trying to write a children’s book — something she had wanted to do for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She discovered that her grief acted as a 'blockage' to her creative writing and decided to start journaling to help her process the difficult emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These notes became the inspiration for her first memoir,&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://mybook.to/IAmAWolfTonight"&gt; I Am A Wolf Tonight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers used a novel, unobtrusive method to track speech in real life, offering an objective window into how social interaction and cognition are linked in healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was driven by a long-standing question in aging research: how do social relationships and communication impact cognitive health in older adulthood? While previous studies have shown that staying socially active can help preserve thinking and memory skills, the methods used to measure social engagement have varied widely. Researchers often rely on broad questionnaires that ask people to recall how often they’ve socialized, attended events, or talked with others—approaches that can be affected by memory errors, personal bias, and inconsistent definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these issues, the research team wanted a more direct and objective way to measure social activity. They chose to focus on one simple but revealing indicator: how much people actually speak during their day. The idea was that speech—especially spontaneous, everyday speech—is a strong signal of real-time social engagement. The researchers aimed to see whether this measure of speech could be meaningfully linked to specific cognitive abilities and life circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were interested in this topic because social engagement has been shown to be important for maintaining cognitive abilities in older adults, but measuring social activity objectively has been challenging. We wanted to explore using advanced technology to unobtrusively measure older adults’ real-life speech as an indicator of social activity, and examine how it relates to various cognitive abilities,” explained study author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick-Neff-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Patrick Neff&lt;/a&gt;, group and scientific project lead at &lt;a href="https://www.tinnitus.uzh.ch/en/team/directors/neff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the University of Zurich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 83 healthy older adults living in Switzerland, aged 65 and up. Participants were part of a larger research project that monitored daily life using wearable sensors. Each person wore a small custom-built recording device, the size of a button, called the “uTrail.” This device captured 50-second audio snippets every 18 minutes during waking hours over the course of four weeks, producing a detailed sample of each person’s real-world speech patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_226801" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-226801" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-226801" src="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024,h_580/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-1024x580.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-300x170.jpg 300w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-768x435.jpg 768w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_750/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-750x425.jpg 750w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1140/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003-1140x646.jpg 1140w, https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_glossy,ret_img,w_1418/https://www.psypost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fpsyg-13-1011177-g003.jpg 1418w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-226801" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;uTrail clip-on device. [&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1011177/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Röcke et al.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;To analyze this large amount of data, the researchers used a machine learning algorithm called Vocalise, which was trained to identify each participant’s voice using a short, clean sample recorded in a lab. This allowed the team to automatically detect when a participant was speaking and for how long—without needing to transcribe or listen to every recording. They then calculated each person’s total “speech ratio,” or the amount of time they were talking as a percentage of the total recording time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants also completed a series of cognitive tests in the lab at the beginning of the study. These tests covered a range of mental abilities, including working memory (the ability to hold and manipulate information in mind), processing speed, verbal fluency (ability to name words quickly based on prompts), executive functioning, episodic memory, and verbal knowledge. In addition, participants provided detailed sociodemographic information, including age, gender, education, income, partner status, number of people in their household, feelings of loneliness, and a self-rating of their hearing ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a statistical approach called Elastic Net regression, the researchers examined which variables were most strongly linked to how much people spoke in their daily lives. Three cognitive abilities stood out. People who scored higher on working memory, processing speed, and semantic fluency tests were more likely to speak more often throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher levels of working memory, processing speed, and semantic fluency were associated with more speech in everyday life for older adults,” Neff told PsyPost. “This suggests these cognitive abilities may be particularly important for engaging in social conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More broadly, our study demonstrates the value of using naturalistic data to gain insights into real-life behavior and cognitive functioning. By unobtrusively recording participants’ speech in their daily lives, we were able to capture authentic patterns of social interaction that may not be apparent in traditional lab-based studies. This approach provides a more ecologically valid picture of how cognitive abilities relate to social engagement in older adults’ everyday experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some sociodemographic factors also predicted speech behavior. The most powerful predictor was whether someone had a partner. Older adults without a partner—whether single, divorced, or widowed—tended to speak significantly less than those in a relationship. This supports the idea that partners play a key role in daily social interaction during later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another surprising finding was that people who rated their hearing as better actually spoke less. One possible explanation is that those with hearing difficulties may overcompensate by talking more to avoid the challenges of listening, or may find themselves in more one-sided conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that better subjective hearing status was associated with less speech in everyday life,” Neff said. “This was unexpected and may indicate that those with poorer hearing engage in more one-sided conversations where they do most of the talking. This could be seen as some kind of compensation strategy of individuals with bad hearing to engage with their (social) environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found no meaningful link between age and daily speech. In other words, within this relatively healthy sample of older adults, age alone did not determine how much someone talked. This may reflect the fact that all participants were cognitively intact and relatively high-functioning, so age-related decline may not have been strongly present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other big surprise was to see that age really did not have any influence on the amount of uttered own speech,” Neff explained. “Here, we might have a bias of very active and healthy older adults participating in the study (selection bias).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our partly surprising results highlight the importance of keeping an open and exploratory mindset when examining real-world data. These findings may reveal complexities in older adults’ social and cognitive functioning that are not captured by conventional research methods. Overall, this study showcases how innovative technologies and naturalistic observation can enhance our understanding of cognitive aging and social behavior in later life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the innovative methods and rich dataset, the study has limitations. The sample was limited to 83 people and skewed toward healthy, well-functioning older adults. That means the findings might not apply to those with cognitive impairments or more diverse backgrounds. The machine learning method, while powerful, also comes with technical constraints. For example, the software only detected speech in five-second chunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the recent developments in AI in the last two years, we already transcended the technical options of the time when this study was conducted and analyzed,” Neff noted. “We’re currently working on a follow-up paper, where we a) further analyze own vs. other speech and their interactions as well as b) further elements of the auditory scene (environmental sounds, noises, media consumption etc.).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our long-term goals are to further refine methods for unobtrusively measuring social activity in daily life and to conduct longitudinal studies examining how cognitive abilities and social engagement influence each other over time in older adults. We also aim to explore potential interventions to enhance social activity and cognitive functioning. The focus here is on real life data collection and application, using techniques like semantic activity analysis and transdisciplinary teams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-82144-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cognitive abilities predict naturalistic speech length in older adults&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Patrick Neff, Burcu Demiray, Mike Martin, and Christina Röcke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 10:10:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNal9qUE9IWHBQMHRCM3NRTmhxNndiWGJHVmgxbG5QdkllekNsMFFWNV94TjcwWnMtMV9tYWFuYThEZDZIYk9wcnhBeDk0eTVtc0xjZkRpQUd3U1BtSVRwaVc3VGZvVmVkOFlBRFlVVlEwdnp3WjlRaldWUHEzU2N2VlZ3WnJpNFlYYTFyT21uS0hmYUJMQjdZenNYWmRMU2k4eVBLQmVLNkdkQ1FLRWRtVGdncG0xSXFI</guid></item><item><title>Why We Need to Embrace Stress - Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta - Podcast on CNN Audio - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNRlFZQmdOYnU4VFFvUkc0MW5MMldkMVZLUGhqdGVKNi01b090SVRSbHR5bEU3TWxLU2NSUHU3bFdzQWY1RnFueTRIajVPdDZhZlRBVkJWNVNLSDk0VFhxVTJCWk85NzIxc1JIN2UwT3k5NTJ6bVh3dUItZC1UTzlWQ21LSi0zVHdNN3Rlb3JnQ2UtYllUaVk1WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="episode-transcript-container" id="transcript-container"&gt;

              There was genuine fury here. Thousands of Iranians, most of them young, rampaged through the streets of Tehran, shouting "Down with the Shah, Death to the Shah."

              Protests in the streets. Food being rationed. It really became very evident that we were not safe. So we left everything and fled as quickly as anybody could get out of a country. I vividly remember being at the airport, we were the last plane to leave before Khomeini came. The airport was incredibly packed. I remember the whole process of trying to get through security and just the mass of people that were there, and how we got onto the runway, every step of it. The plane stopped in Kuwait. Because we are Jewish, they threatened to kill my father. It was a layover because they were trying to take as many people out of Iran as possible and then take us to our final destination, which was England. The airlines had to intercede on our behalf. So to save my father's life. And at every juncture, they separate men from women and children and threatened to kill the men.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              Now, that type of stress, I think, for so many of us, is just unimaginable. But thankfully, Sharon and her family did make it safely to their final destination and eventually settled in Atlanta, Georgia. But even then, Sharon faced and overcame a new series of setbacks.

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:22

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I view it as a gift to have encountered that in early life, because it puts so much in perspective later in life of what is considered a quote, bad day.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:37
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Sharon says it was those early experiences in childhood, combined with the support of her parents, that made her more resilient. She went on to attend Harvard Medical School, and today she's a stress researcher and a practicing physician who continuously uses what she learned to now help her patients.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:56
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And what I've learned from it is something that can help other people because ultimately it triggered this obsession for me, of why is it that some people grow and thrive from these experiences and others don't? And the amazing part of it, is that what we need to become resilient is in all of us. Like, there's nothing special about me or my family. We all have this gift in our DNA to become resilient in the face of stress. Most people just don't know how to summon that ability.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:36
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              She's got a new book called "The Stress Paradox", and in it, Dr. Bergquist goes so far as to say that certain types of stress can help us, help us prevent disease, help us even with aging.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:49
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, too much stress harms us, but not enough is actually just as harmful.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:55
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Look, it's a bold claim and flips a lot of what we've known about stress right on its head. So today I'm going to ask Dr. Bergquist to make the case for why stress can be a good thing. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, and this is Chasing Life.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:04:17
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Just going back to childhood for a second, how much of your career then your focus on stress, you're writing a book about stress does go back to what you experienced as a child?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:04:27
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think the seeds of it were there. I think in retrospect, when I connect the dots, I think that influence is huge. I don't think I made that realization until in my professional career, I became really interested in this question of is all stress harmful? Because I work with a lot of professionals that are very driven, but are also so passionate about what they do, and I would put myself in that category, and so I could not help but wonder, is that a bad thing or is that a good thing?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:12
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's a good question, because as you're saying that, I'm thinking that kind of describes me.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:16
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:16
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I live a pretty high stress life, but I'm generally pretty engaged, energetic and happy.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:20
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:20
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But I would describe myself as stressed.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:23
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I would, now knowing what I know, call that good stress. Which I think has a very different effect on our bodies than the harmful stress that has become almost synonymous with what people describe as stress. So for me, it's led to a complete reframing of our relationship with stress. I think I can now say with a comfortable level that, that type of stress releases a biochemical profile that is actually health promoting. We release, for example, dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:06:02
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              In response to stress, you're saying.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:06:04
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              In the response to stress. And that biochemical response is so different than the simplistic stress response that we think of,
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:06:14
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Cortisol and adrenaline...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:06:16
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Exactly. Our stress response is so much more complicated, and different types of stress trigger a different biochemical response. The stressors that are harmful are generally ones that are not predictable, and they're just unavoidable because there's so much uncertainty that leads to some of the harmful effect that is downstream. And often these stressors are not brief and intermittent. They're much more a chronic, continuous, and those are generally the ones that are harmful. When you look at resilience as this muscle, a lot of childhood events, for example, people have dealt with a lot of different forms of adversity in childhood, and there's a lot of literature on how childhood adversity can lead to long term harm throughout life. But that's your passive resilience. When you choose your stress, you are shapeshifting, an active form of resilience, because resilience is incredibly dynamic, just like building muscle is. So when we take on these good stressors, interestingly enough, the hormones we're talking about here, the dopamine for the reward for doing something meaningful, the serotonin, that joy that comes from accomplishment. The oxytocin from contributing to the greater good. That is the trifecta that mitigates our cortisol level. It literally builds our resilience to stress so we don't have to fear it all.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:51
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So at the same time, you have stress, you're also building more resilience. It's like a workout I guess, if you're thinking of it from a muscle metaphor.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:08:00
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Resilience is a muscle. And our ability to shape our resilience and to shape the downstream effect of that passive resilience from those childhood exposures. Is like when we could not have ever imagined. So I think that we all have this ability to choose some stressors, these good stressors, and that helps us handle the types of stressors that are unavoidable. And it's really a shifting from kind of playing defense of always trying to curb the chronic stress, fight, wrangle, draw boundaries around stress to one that is playing offense, right? So we are just going to become stronger so we can handle more stress in the future.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:08:50
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              If you don't stress yourself at all that that's bad. I mean, you're not going to get out of bed in the morning. You're not going to study for an exam, things like that. But the idea that there's all these biochemical processes that are happening in your body, that wouldn't be happening if you never challenge yourself at all. I think is is the point that you're making. You need this.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:09:08
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think it's because we understand stress so much better now. In the last two decades, we have cellular and molecular based technology that is looking at what happens down to a very granular level in our bodies. The stress response we're all familiar with is fight or flight, right? The release of catecholamines, the cortisol. But we have this layer of stress responses in our cells, we actually have seven cellular stress responses. And these stress responses in our cells activate our ability to moderate inflammation. So how we understand stress has changed so much. And the key really is that our stress responses are there to help us. They're there to help us adapt to our world. They've, for our entire human history, been how we have survived and thrived. But the things that help us activate those stress responses have been removed from the fabric of our lives. At no time in human history, until the last hundred years, have we removed the natural stressors that were in our environment that were built in like food scarcity, needing to survive on edible plants, needing to have moments of intense exercise, exposure to extremes of heat and cold, mental challenges that forced you to think beyond the horizon. We have increased our lives in a way that have made our lives very comfortable, and we can get a lot of gratification very instantly. We can have access to food 24/7. The introduction of a lot of these comforts has removed our connection with the natural environment that we live in, and the ultimate need of our physiology to express the genes that activate the cellular stress responses. We are essentially handicapping ourselves because we are not allowing our bodies to do what they are so capable of doing.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's, it's it's interesting. I think anybody who says, hey, I'm going to read a book about stress, they're probably thinking I'm going to read a book about how to mitigate or reduce my stress. And in some ways, doctor, you're making the argument that go out and find yourself some.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:11:54
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah!
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:11:54
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But the right amount of stress. The point is the right amount of stress, maybe even more so than calling it good stress or bad stress, because good or bad are attributes that are very much dependent on how much you're getting.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:12:09
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That is such a critical point. This science of what I'm calling good stress is hormesis, it's the science of good stress from this Greek word, to excite is how hormesis was derived, and it is mild to moderate stress followed by recovery. It is not, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I would actually say that that is not good stress. The goal is to do stress with the small s, not capital S, and it's those little incremental exposures that ultimately make us stronger. Cortisol is not a good or bad hormone. Cortisol is just telling our body we need energy. You know, exercise can evoke it or we can evoke it through job situations we don't like, financial hardship. I mean, these chronic stressors that lead to your baseline level of cortisol being elevated, which is a very different scenario. So it's not that our body has a moral code. It can our body is just responding to the inputs. And if we can just change the inputs, we change the output.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:13:27
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Now, I want to jump in for a second and make sure you got that, Dr. Bergquist is saying that when we choose to challenge ourselves with intentional bouts of stress that can help us become more resilient to future stressors that may be outside of our control. And to be clear, although we've been talking mostly about psychological stress, Dr. Bergquist also points out that challenging our bodies can be beneficial as well. Like fasting, for example, or intermittent high intensity exercise, hot or cold therapy like saunas. They can all be ways to harness the power of good stress.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:14:02
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Finding tools that are accessible that awaken our natural defense against chronic disease. And I mean mental and physical chronic disease, anxiety, depression, diabetes, heart disease. To me, the fact that we can all access our body's innate defense mechanisms if we just knew how. And that stress is, interestingly, the most powerful lever for doing this became something that I felt more than just my patients needed to know about.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:14:39
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Coming up after the break, Dr. Bergquist helps us create a life full of good stress.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:14:53
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              For me, doc, and I think for our a probably a lot of people, I could experience the same stress on a Tuesday and feel defeated by it, whereas on Wednesday I'm emboldened by it. And I don't always know why that is. It could be that I slept well the night before, I had a good meal, I don't know, but it's the same exact stress. And one day it crushes me and the next day I feel fueled by it. How do I summon? How does anyone summon the resilience when they need it the most?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:15:25
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              The recovery is a really big part of this day to day variation. So you hit the nail on the head. It is how much you slept the night before. It is also a combination of what did your body go through that same day, right? If you also exercised that day, you ate fairly healthy. All these variables impact day to day resilience. So how much stress a person can handle is not just different person to person is different for the same person from day to day. So I think we can all just make note of what helps us on the days that we can sail through it. Um, the recovery piece, of course, is critical, but looking at other factors, you know, did exercise play a role? Did the amount of sunlight and how you sync'd your circadian biology make a difference? What was that first meal like? I think we could drill it down. I think most of us don't spend the time, you know, doing that kind of human experiment to figure it out.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:16:35
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But so what do you tell somebody in that situation who comes in who's probably a pretty high stress individual and yet loves, loves what they do? How do you guide them, doctor?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:16:47
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think the key is strategic recovery because our bodies are designed for brief, intermittent stress. That is how we grow. But our bodies need that period of recovery. So when we go through brief intermittent stress in stress mode, our bodies are getting the signal down to ourselves to become more efficient. We do a lot of repair housekeeping functions. It is in recovery that we actually reconfigure and reshape our bodies in a way that helps us handle future stress better. If you go through a period of stress and you don't allow yourself that recovery, you miss that opportunity to actually grow from that exposure to stress. So the key for people who are driven and high functioning is the stress is okay. Do not fear it. Embrace it, but plan for the recovery. And I think that that is ultimately the blueprint of how we become our strongest self, right? Stress. Recover. Repeat. Stress. Recover. Repeat. Because our bodies work through bioplasticity. And in the brain that's neuroplasticity. And we know that when we are exposed to cortisol in a mild to moderate range for a brief transient time, that tells are synapses to make stronger connections like we bind different receptors in our brain depending on the amount of cortisol. The short term, we bind mineralocorticoid receptors. That sends a signal to grow within the communications between our neurons at a high amount. In the chronic state of stress or a very intense amount of stress, cortisol starts to bind the glucocorticoid receptors, which actually prune those synaptic connections. So you want to straddle this kind of Goldilocks amount of stress followed by recovery. So you are benefiting from the stress. And what's really fascinating is yes, too much stress harms us, but not enough is actually just as harmful.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:08
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's really fascinating. But how do you know when it is too much stress, though?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:12
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think intuitively we know. When it's bad stress, we feel exhausted, depleted. We feel we're on the verge of burnout. We want to escape. When it's good stress for energized, for motivated. We're creative. Like we just feel like it's effortless. I think we just have to tune in to our bodies, and I think we just have that knowing. And I think that that's a really good framework for every type of stress. You know, we've been talking so much about psychological stress. I will extend that to the physical stressors in the foods we eat, the type of movement, I mean, stress in a technical sense is anything that challenges your body. And whether your health habit is health promoting or taking away from your health is ultimately how do you feel afterward?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:20:07
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              If you feel like you've you've, you're in a bad stress or call it too much stress for sort of keeping this Goldilocks metaphor that what do you, what do you, you want to make sure that you're going into the stressor as sort of ready as you can be, having slept the night before, eating and all that. But if you're in that situation now where you feel like it's too much stress intuitively, you know, what do you, what do you do in that moment?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:20:32
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think that is your signal that you need recovery. Like when you reach that point where you feel that, you know, if you picture your cortisol level as the metric, if you just feel that is just so high that you're not even functioning effectively, you need to step away. I mean, it could be a walk outside. It could be connecting.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:20:56
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I read this book, which I really loved. I'm sure you've read it as well. It's my second favorite book next to yours, the the it's called "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers", Robert Sapolsky. And the point that Robert makes, I'm sure, and you read in the book is like for zebras, you know, they can be chased and while they're being chased, they're the cortisol levels and all this stress stuff goes way up. And then as soon as they're not being chased, milliseconds later, their stress levels come back down. They're happily grazing, whatever. We humans don't quite have that luxury, in part because of this phone that I'm holding up and just all the various things in our lives, so we don't get a break from it. It's that relentless nature of it. Have you seen that worsening in your own practice?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, in primary care, 60 to 90% of visits are stress related.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. Across the country, national surveys. And I would echo that that would hold for my practice.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              60 to 90% stress related.

              Stress related illnesses that may manifest as headaches, irritable bowel. It comes in different forms, but that stress plays a big role in the manifestation.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And has that gotten worse over time?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think that it ebbs and flows. I do think that we are at a period of heightened stress right now. I think, um, that is clearly a big contributor to a lot of illnesses that we're seeing.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Too much TV, too much politics.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Haha. It is and too much information and very hard to know how to put the information in a larger perspective of whether it's just current state or whether it's just that we now have the awareness about a lot of things that our parents dealt with, but we just didn't have the same level of awareness.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right? So, it's the access to that information.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. I mean, look I say this in part in jest, but also someone who works in the news business, it's a lot. Um, it's a fire hydrant of information and a lot of it's not good. And I think just to be completely immersed in that all the time, even as someone who's in the business from a medical standpoint, you can recognize that that's not good. Finding breaks from that. By the way, are your parents still living?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              My mom is. My dad passed away November of 2022. He was a man of very few words, but what he would choose to say always carried a lot of weight because it was always very thoughtful and reflective. And the book truly is dedicated to him. It's in his memory because he had this unbelievable acceptance, stoicism and resilience and handled everything that came his way with unbelievable calm. And I now term that resilience because we know at a biochemical level that people who have that kind of resilience emit an energy that invites calm instead of chaos, that attracts rather than repels, that inspires instead of evokes fear. And my father had that. And for me, this is a way of breaking down, defining and putting terms to what is it about people like that, that become this, you know, people would describe my father as whatever corner of the room he was at, that is where you could find peace and serenity. And people would just gravitate towards him when, you know, people were in a scenario at a party or an event where they needed that sense of calm. And I feel that now I understand what is it about people who have that and the amount of synchrony in their body, in their soul that emits that type of energy. And I think we're all capable of it, and I think that we can get to that point if we are willing to go past our comfort zone, even for brief amounts of time, again followed by recovery, because that is the path of getting there. That is how we create this positive, virtuous cycle in our world. And I hope that everyone makes that investment in themselves, because ultimately it's an investment in other people.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

Why? Because when I parked my car at the grocery store, I made the mistake of twisting around to grab shopping bags from the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;I felt a zing of pain in the middle of my back. Uh oh!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db415-H.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that over a third of U.S. adults have experienced back pain during a three-month period — but few treatments actually work, according to a new &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/well/lower-back-pain-treatments-nsaids.html" title=""&gt;study that analyzed hundreds of trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So I thought it might be helpful to focus on how to prevent back pain in the first place. I’ve asked orthopedic doctors for their best tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="css-15h6bi9 e1gnsphs0" id="link-7b752b55"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Skip the “B.L.T.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;My car incident “is what we euphemistically call the B.L.T.,” or the bend, lift and twist, said Dr. Arthur L. Jenkins III, a neurosurgeon in New York City who specializes in spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doing all three actions at once, whether by shoveling snow or extracting a child from a car seat, “maximizes the stress on the disc, making it more likely to rupture,” Dr. Jenkins said. “As a spine surgeon, I would never do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you are about to B.L.T., take a beat and try to do each motion separately, Dr. Jenkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When lifting an object, make sure both feet are planted and your weight is evenly distributed, said Dr. Gbolabo Sokunbi, a spine surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan. Then lift from your legs instead of your arms and back, he said. Keep heavier items close to your body when picking them up, which puts &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="back.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74707-4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;less strain&lt;/a&gt; on your spine, Dr. Sokunbi added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

It's not only painful but also keeps you in a constant state of discomfort throughout the day. When you are constipated, your thoughts are occupied with your disrupted bowel movements, affecting your daily work. It's time you take back control of your day and health with the help of some simple dietary changes. Constipation is a sign of poor gut health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/28/550x309/constipated_1743166913127_1743166913367.jpg" alt="Constipation is very stressful.(Freepik)" title="Constipation is very stressful.(Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/28/550x309/constipated_1743166913127_1743166913367.jpg" alt="Constipation is very stressful.(Freepik)" title="Constipation is very stressful.(Freepik)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Constipation is very stressful.(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gastroenterologist Dr Saurabh Sethi, who frequently posts &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/nutrition"&gt;nutrition&lt;/a&gt; tips for gut care, shared on 26 March 3 seeds that can transform your gut health and prevent common problems like &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/constipation-could-be-a-heart-attack-waiting-to-happen-symptoms-to-watch-out-for-prevention-tips-101724749956679.html"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;. Dr Sethi said that he usually recommended these seeds to his patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Superseeds are regarded as the powerhouse, packed with nutritional goodness, from minerals like magnesium to gut friendly fiber. More and more seeds are being added to diets for an all rounder benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi listed out the gut benefits for each of the seeds:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Black sesame&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black sesame is an underrated seed on this list, receiving less buzz on social media compared to the others. But don't be so quick to dismiss it, as black sesame has ample benefits for your struggling gut health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi explained, “The fiber in sesame seeds helps promote smooth bowel movement. It also contains magnesium, which relaxes intestinal muscles, improving the movement of food through the GI system. ”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Flax seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flax seeds come with all-in-one benefits, going beyond gut health. Doctor pointed out hormone regulation as one of its proven benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi said, “Flax seeds are rich in fiber as well. On top of it, the lignans in flax seeds also help balance hormones and their omega 3 fatty acids, reduce gut inflammation, promoting a healthier GI system.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/recipe/wholesome-delights-4-delicious-flaxseed-recipes-for-health-conscious-foodies-101706683082870.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wholesome delights: 4 delicious flaxseed recipes for health-conscious foodies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are a fan favourite and have become ubiquitous in weight loss diets, appearing in everything from smoothies to puddings. They may be tiny, but they can absorb huge water content.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi added, “These seeds can absorb up to 12 times their weight in water and form a gel like consistency which can help you get excellent BMs (bowel movements)."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/recipe/tired-of-chia-seeds-in-smoothie-bowls-try-this-delicious-tiramisu-chia-seed-pudding-recipe-for-tasty-healthy-eating-101741263499203.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tired of chia seeds in smoothie bowls?

&lt;p&gt;I won’t lie; I get slightly rattled when a new TikTok fat loss trend takes off. Not just because I’ve become even grumpier about fads since I hit my thirties, but also because many fitness trends aren’t rooted in reality or research. Which brings me to the latest craze — the 30/30/30 rule. Although it’s grounded in some science, the latest fat loss method isn’t&lt;em&gt; exactly&lt;/em&gt; what it’s cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30/30/30 rule was first popularized by Tim Ferriss and then Gary Brecka. Ferriss wrote about it in his book, “The 4-Hour Body,” while Brecka took it to social media after a TEDx Talk on the topic. And so, the 30/30/30 method gained significant traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule states you should consume 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking and perform 30 minutes of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/forget-running-i-tried-this-30-minute-steady-state-workout-to-burn-calories-here-are-my-results" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/forget-running-i-tried-this-30-minute-steady-state-workout-to-burn-calories-here-are-my-results"&gt;steady-state cardio&lt;/a&gt; (SSC) like walking. Not exactly controversial, but another “rule” overpromising on fat loss nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a nutritionist, but as a trainer, I try to break down diet fads with clients. When this method came into play, I wanted to deep-dive into it. Here’s everything you need to know about the 30/30/30 method, and whether or not it could help you lose weight and burn fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-tim-ferriss-30-30-30-rule"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is Tim Ferriss' 30/30/30 rule?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the method involves consuming 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking. The food you choose is entirely up to you, but it should help you feel satiated (which is common with a high-protein diet) and contain fiber. A meal of spinach, black beans, eggs and cottage cheese would count, for example. According to Ferriss, this should help you consume fewer calories by up to &lt;em&gt;30% &lt;/em&gt;across the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video (which I'm now obsessed with), Ben and his wife, fellow coach Sohee Carpenter, agree that while protein is great and 30 grams is a “solid guideline” to aim for, consuming within 30 minutes of waking isn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And only steady-state cardio? Also unnecessary. After all, why would 30 minutes of the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; exercise type completed &lt;em&gt;first thing&lt;/em&gt; in the morning be the perfect formula for &lt;em&gt;everyone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here’s the thing with magic number formulas,” Carpenter says. “They are catchy and easy to market, but they are rarely scientific.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know that eating a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/study-suggests-you-may-need-more-protein-after-cardio-than-you-think-heres-the-real-number" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/study-suggests-you-may-need-more-protein-after-cardio-than-you-think-heres-the-real-number"&gt;high-protein diet&lt;/a&gt; alongside regular exercise is proven to support healthy and sustainable fat loss. But those sexy-looking numbers are pretty much made-up. And although the approach admittedly promotes a sustainable method for fat loss, the outcome won’t ever be the same (or guaranteed) for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, there's no such thing as a unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-the-30-30-30-rule-for-weight-loss-the-science"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the 30/30/30 rule for weight loss: The science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the three &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/counting-macros-for-beginners-how-to-track-your-macros-for-fat-loss-and-muscle-growth" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/counting-macros-for-beginners-how-to-track-your-macros-for-fat-loss-and-muscle-growth"&gt;macronutrients&lt;/a&gt; (carbs, fats and protein), carbs serve as your body’s primary source of fuel for energy during exercise.

She explains that “protein slows digestion and the release of glucose into the bloodstream” when consumed alongside carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can help reduce sharp blood sugar spikes and crashes, and&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14522731/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14522731/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; research &lt;/a&gt;even suggests an increase in protein could help improve blood glucose regulation and stabilization. We know insulin resistance can inhibit weight loss and contribute to stubborn fat, so a high-protein diet could promote faster weight loss by helping to balance your blood sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the focus on exercise, your diet is also largely responsible for overall body composition — your fat-to-muscle ratio. Even if you spend months building muscle, your&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-calculate-your-body-fat-percentage-and-why-it-matters" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-calculate-your-body-fat-percentage-and-why-it-matters"&gt; body fat percentage&lt;/a&gt; is determined by factors like lifestyle (sleep, diet, exercise),&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/slow-metabolism-this-could-be-the-secret-to-better-workouts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/slow-metabolism-this-could-be-the-secret-to-better-workouts"&gt; metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and genetics, and will subsequently help determine muscle definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here’s the thing with magic number formulas,” Carpenter says. “They are catchy and easy to market, but they're rarely scientific.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, let's discuss timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s little evidence suggesting the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/this-is-the-best-time-to-drink-a-protein-shake-and-its-not-when-you-think" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/this-is-the-best-time-to-drink-a-protein-shake-and-its-not-when-you-think"&gt;best time to consume protein&lt;/a&gt; is within 30 minutes of waking for fat loss. For some, it could even cause digestion issues. Sure, cramming 30 grams of protein into your morning is hardly a bad way to start the day — it could help reduce calorie consumption later by keeping you fuller — but overall protein intake is the most important number, preferably spread across the day, not how quickly you consume it after waking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting isn’t for everyone, so if you like to eat straightaway, go ahead, just don't clock watch while you do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recommend protein with every meal and consuming roughly 1 to 1.5 grams per kilo of body weight daily, or up to 2 grams if trying to build muscle. An&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/legacy/fnic/dri-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://www.nal.usda.gov/legacy/fnic/dri-calculator/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; online protein calculator&lt;/a&gt; can help you estimate your recommended protein intake if you're unsure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-30-30-30-rule-is-eating-in-the-morning-better-for-fat-loss"&gt;&lt;span&gt;30/30/30 rule: Is eating in the morning better for fat loss?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Front-loading your day with protein could keep you full and promote healthier choices throughout the day while balancing your blood sugar and helping you to hit your daily protein target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But again, you don’t need to cram your protein into a 30-minute morning window. Some people prefer eating before exercising, while others may wait until they’ve finished a workout to consume food, as it makes them feel unwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When deciding the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/should-you-eat-before-or-after-a-workout" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/should-you-eat-before-or-after-a-workout"&gt;best time to eat for your workout&lt;/a&gt;, there are benefits for both fasted versus fed-state training, but you won’t damage your chances of losing fat if you don’t eat within 30 minutes of waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research, like this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l42" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l42" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study published in the BMJ&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that “breakfast might not be a good strategy” for some on their weight loss journey and could even have the opposite effect, although the research did have limitations and needed further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-30-30-30-is-exercising-in-the-morning-better"&gt;&lt;span&gt;30/30/30: Is exercising in the morning better?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no magic number on the timing of exercise for weight loss, either, despite fasted morning training being hailed as the best fat loss tool around. The most sustainable method to promote fat loss through exercise is through consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considering the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-to-exercise-for-better-sleep-according-to-doctors" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-to-exercise-for-better-sleep-according-to-doctors"&gt;best time to exercise&lt;/a&gt;, morning workouts could help you feel energized, boost your mood and improve decision-making throughout the day. For some, exercise in the morning means ticking that box before life commitments take over. Gentle movement after eating could also aid digestion, improve energy levels and contribute toward overall energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s widely thought that more vigorous exercise styles should be minimized close to bedtime (within a few hours), as this could inhibit &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/what-is-sleep-hygiene-tips-and-habits" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/what-is-sleep-hygiene-tips-and-habits"&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt;; the release of hormones like adrenaline and cortisol may even impact sleep latency (how long it takes to drop off into your slumber).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23851" target="_blank" data-url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23851" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; supports the “promising role” of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity performed in the morning for weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, exercising in the morning doesn’t work for everyone. For some (like me), exercising later in the day when energy levels are higher leads to better performance, pre- or post-feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important factor is finding the time to exercise whenever it works, whether that means bite-sized workouts during the day — known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-exercise-snacking-every-day-for-a-week-here-are-3-ways-it-changed-my-workouts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-exercise-snacking-every-day-for-a-week-here-are-3-ways-it-changed-my-workouts"&gt;exercise snacking&lt;/a&gt; — or exercising later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the&lt;em&gt; type&lt;/em&gt; of exercise you do, there are benefits to all exercise, whatever you enjoy. The recommended guidelines state you should aim for a mix of resistance training and moderate to vigorous activity in your weekly routine, upward of 150 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy kicking it up a gear, there’s &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10048683/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10048683/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to indicate that HIIT &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;SSC can promote fat loss; HIIT is considered more efficient and can kickstart the afterburn effect known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/epoc-what-is-it-and-5-ways-to-boost-your-metabolism-and-burn-calories-fast" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/epoc-what-is-it-and-5-ways-to-boost-your-metabolism-and-burn-calories-fast"&gt;EPOC&lt;/a&gt; (Excess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption), when your metabolism elevates for a short time post-exercise. But it doesn’t make steady cardio redundant, which is credited with improving cardiovascular health and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t enjoy SSC, resistance training builds lean muscle mass, which is more metabolically active than fat. The more lean muscle and less fat you have, the better potential for your metabolic health. In short, there are benefits to all movement, especially when that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415300/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8415300/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;exercise is combined with a high-protein diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pairing food to your workout, it’s worth remembering that your body has different uses for fat, carbs and protein to support exercise efforts (read: &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/can-eating-before-a-workout-boost-fat-loss-or-should-you-train-on-an-empty-stomach-we-asked-the-experts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/can-eating-before-a-workout-boost-fat-loss-or-should-you-train-on-an-empty-stomach-we-asked-the-experts"&gt;Can eating before a workout boost fat loss or should you train on an empty stomach? We asked the experts&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-are-there-any-risks-to-following-the-30-30-30-method"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are there any risks to following the 30/30/30 method?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30/30/30 rule isn’t extreme (thankfully), so there are no real contraindications. However, those pregnant or dealing with a pre-existing illness or health condition should always consult a qualified medical professional before starting a new exercise or diet regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-30-30-30-method-my-verdict"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 30/30/30 method: My verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30/30/30 method is rooted in some “good” science and encourages building healthier habits, but the numbers aren’t the most important factor here. To paraphrase Carpenter: they just market well. Forget 30 minutes and forget 30 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, pairing high protein intake with daily exercise can contribute to fat loss and help build lean muscle mass. If you enjoy eating and exercising first thing in the morning, there are benefits to this, too, like keeping you full and energized and front-loading consumption before the day takes over. However, following the method won’t necessarily make the weight fall off as promoted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the 30/30/30 method doesn’t work for your lifestyle, it's not that deep. Overall movement output and protein intake matter most, alongside a modest calorie deficit (consuming fewer calories than you burn) if your goal is sustainable fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also recommend plenty of fiber (around 30 grams per day) to promote healthy digestion and keep you feeling satiated alongside the other macronutrients your body needs — fats and carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

I’m an oncologist and a cancer epidemiologist, which means I investigate patterns and causes of cancers. As &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/12/alcohol-consumption-industry/" target="_blank"&gt;more Americans drink less&lt;/a&gt;, one question that has come up is whether casual drinking, or drinking alcohol infrequently, increases cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U2SOVDF7K5BHHDWZLSOPAAOXFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The answer is “probably,” though at a very low level. Cancer risk is not binary: Having one drink, or smoking one cigarette, will not cause cancer. In general, the more you’re exposed to a risk factor, the higher your likelihood of developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WBT2M2NOZBANNDSEOVN7LWRE4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Read his full response below.

                                        &lt;p&gt;Medical disinformation connected to the West Texas measles outbreak has created a new problem. Children are being treated for toxic levels of vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock confirms it is treating children with severe cases of measles who are also suffering from vitamin A toxicity. According to the hospital, they have admitted fewer than 10 pediatric patients who were all initially hospitalized due to measles complications but have elevated levels of vitamin A that is resulting in abnormal liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. directed the CDC to update its measles guidance to promote the use of vitamin A. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, recommended in an article published March 2 on FOX News to take vitamin A under the supervision of a physician for those with mild, moderate and severe infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a March 4 interview on Fox News, Kennedy suggested that therapies such as the use of cod liver oil — which contains vitamins A and D — were "working" in treating measles patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are reports from the West Texas area that cod liver oil is in high demand and a big seller at area pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the hospital is informing the public to reduce consumption of vitamin A and has warned that excessive amounts of it may result in significant adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that taking vitamin A will prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has administered vitamin A in Africa to reduce mortality during measles outbreaks. This is a strategy in a part of the world with widespread malnourishment, and vitamin A deficiency compromises the immune system. However, malnourishment is not a problem in West Texas or in other locations where the measles outbreak has spread in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 320 people in Texas have contracted measles in recent weeks. Forty people have been hospitalized in the state, and one child has died in the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Give up? They've both at one point or another caused  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="156656" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; colonic-related controversies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.royal.uk/clarencehouse/speech/speech-hrh-prince-wales-complementary-therapies-and-cancer-care-royal-college-obstetricians"&gt;2004 speech&lt;/a&gt; to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on complementary therapies and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="156656" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; care, the then Prince of Wales's comments on &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/gerson-pdq"&gt;Gerson therapy&lt;/a&gt; – a health programme, marketed as an alternative treatment for cancer, that includes regular coffee enemas as a way to clear toxins from the body – seemed to endorse the unproven regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prince's opinion drew criticism from &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/329/7457/118"&gt;medical experts&lt;/a&gt;. Wellness influencer Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2018/01/06/gwyneth-paltrows-goop-promotes-a-135-coffee-enema-kit/"&gt;promoted a DIY coffee enema&lt;/a&gt; kit on Goop, her lifestyle website – again &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/09/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-coffee-enema-colonic-irrigation"&gt;drawing criticism&lt;/a&gt; from specialists who &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canadian-doctors-gwyneth-paltrow-goop-coffee-enema-1.4479955"&gt;urged Goop fans&lt;/a&gt; to "keep the coffee out of your rectum and in your cup".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the expert critique, coffee enemas continue to be a social media wellness trend offered in many alternative health clinics as a method to cleanse the colon and detoxify the body. More worryingly, coffee enemas are still recommended &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/apple-cider-vinegar-netflix"&gt;by some influencers&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;alternative treatment for cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pENvHuJd9MY?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why does the popularity of this controversial trend persist despite the bad press? Do the benefits of a coffee enema outweigh the risks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.bladderandbowel.org/medicinal-treatment/enema/"&gt;enema&lt;/a&gt; clears the bowel of faecal matter. Usually, the procedure involves inserting a nozzle attached to a pouch containing fluid into the rectum so the liquid can be squeezed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conventional medicine, enemas are used to clear the bowel before surgery, for severe cases of constipation or sometimes as part of a bowel management scheme – in people with inflammatory bowel diseases, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://colonic-association.org/colon-hydrotherapy/history"&gt;It's claimed&lt;/a&gt; by some coffee enema advocates that, before the advent of modern painkillers, Florence Nightingale used coffee enemas as a form of pain management in soldiers during the Crimean War, and doctors used them &lt;a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/episode/module-28-charlotte-gerson/umc.cmc.vid7anfcpffn43gs2zg7eku0"&gt;in the second world war&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156658" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156658" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642.jpg" alt="colon illustration" class="wp-image-156658 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642-467x415.jpg 467w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/colon_illustration_642-600x534.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156658" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Enemas have been used to clear the bowel for people with inflammatory bowel diseases. (Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library Getty)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gerson therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite the advances in medicine and technology since Nightingale was nursing injured soldiers, coffee enemas continue to be promoted as a health practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;Gerson therapy&lt;/a&gt; continues to be highly publicised as an alternative option to chemotherapy. Patients follow a strict organic vegetarian diet, which can include up to 13 glasses of fruit juice and up to five coffee enemas daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gerson Institute &lt;a href="https://gerson.org/faqs/"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; the enemas can increase gut movement which helps to empty bowels. Coffee enemas are believed to help the body expel toxins from the liver and gut, which is thought to relieve pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee contains compounds &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7478478/"&gt;kahweol and cafestol&lt;/a&gt;, thought to boost an enzyme which helps remove harmful substances from the body. These substances are turned into bile salts and expelled from the body. The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30387-0/fulltext"&gt;caffeine in coffee is thought&lt;/a&gt; to stimulate the liver and widen the bile ducts to increase the flow of bile and help remove toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show there is no evidence to prove this regime works to cure cancer and it is not supported by any reputable cancer organisations. But it's possible the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="156656" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; effect might help some patients feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7478478/"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; showed there were more reports about the side effects of coffee enemas than their efficacy. Some people, for instance, experienced &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acgcr/fulltext/2020/01000/proctocolitis_from_coffee_enema.8.aspx"&gt;proctocolitis&lt;/a&gt; – inflamed rectum and colon – and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20073005/"&gt;rectal burns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtFDVWQhEF0?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Self-cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the amount of waste that is expelled from the gut, coffee enemas can remove potassium from the body. This can lead to electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, muscle weakness and nausea. In &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/gerson"&gt;severe cases&lt;/a&gt;, it can cause irregular heartbeats and lung problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using any enemas regularly for a long time can cause the bowel muscle to weaken, which is linked to constipation and inflammation of the bowel. In some &lt;a href="https://badgut.org/information-centre/a-z-digestive-topics/enemas/#:%7E:text=Many%20proponents%20of%20using%20home,balance%20and%20cause%20digestive%20symptoms."&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt;, enemas may damage the balance of good bacteria in the gut, which can cause cramping, diarrhoea and bloating and increase the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There no need for DIY enemas of any kind: the gut is self-cleaning. Regular digestion and bowel movements means the body gets rid of waste naturally. A high-fibre diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, wholegrains and seeds should be enough for good digestive health and could even &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/diet-and-cancer/wholegrains-fibre-and-cancer-risk#"&gt;reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt; of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gutscharity.org.uk/advice-and-information/health-and-lifestyle/fibre/how-to-increase-your-fibre-intake/"&gt;Current advice&lt;/a&gt; suggests we consume at least 30 g of fibre daily. Most adults, however, have an average of only 19 g of fibre daily. Drinking plenty of water &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/water-a-fluid-way-to-manage-constipation"&gt;is also crucial&lt;/a&gt; to gut health. &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2017.1383355"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that eating &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fermentation"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as kimchi, kefir and kombucha, can help the good bacteria in the gut and aid with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinking coffee is more likely to be &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/all-the-reasons-a-cup-of-coffee-really-can-be-good-for-you-236852"&gt;beneficial for health&lt;/a&gt; than coffee enemas. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322007311"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that moderate coffee intake is linked to lower risk of heart disease, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media can be a useful way to learn about health but it's important to check who is giving this information – do they have credentials to back up their claims? It's always best to check with your doctor or specialist before embarking on any alternative or complementary therapies.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/252412/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Although &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/donanemab-licensed-for-early-stages-of-alzheimers-disease-in-adult-patients-who-have-one-or-no-copies-of-apolipoprotein-e4-gene"&gt;some recently developed drugs&lt;/a&gt; show promise in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lecanemab-licensed-for-adult-patients-in-the-early-stages-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;slowing the progress&lt;/a&gt; of the disease, these are both costly and may have limited benefit for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/trc2.70037"&gt;recent Cambridge-led study&lt;/a&gt; has found a link between commonly used prescription drugs – including antibiotics, antivirals and vaccines – and a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given these drugs are already licensed and their safety profiles well established, this could enable faster and more cost-effective clinical trials in the search for a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/trc2.70037"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; analysed health data from 130 million people, including one million people who had been diagnosed with dementia. Having identified possible links with prescription drugs and dementia risk, the researchers conducted a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of 14 studies to explore these links further and understand which prescription drugs might affect dementia outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led them to the conclusion that antibiotics, antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs were all associated with reduced dementia risk. The researchers also found a link between the hepatitis A, typhoid and diphtheria vaccines and lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unknown how long participants had been taking any of these prescription drugs or how many times they’d been prescribed them during their lifetime, so it will be important for future studies to investigate these factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Immune reponse and brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings, the researchers suggest that the protective effects that these prescription drugs appear to have may be because they reduce inflammation, control infections and improve overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supports the theory that common types of dementia could be triggered by &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/possible-risks-of-dementia/infections#:%7E:text=Research%20suggests%20that%20infections%20may,you%20maintain%20good%20dental%20health."&gt;viral or bacterial infections&lt;/a&gt;. We know that infections that last a few days to several weeks, whether bacterial or viral, can cause great &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8668867"&gt;damage to the brain&lt;/a&gt;. This is because infections cause an enhanced immune response from the body, which can damage brain cells – disrupting brain connections and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35234334/"&gt;accelerating memory decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antivirals and antibiotics help combat infections, which in turn may dampen this excessive immune response. Meanwhile, vaccines can prevent these infections from occurring in the first place. In both cases, this can significantly reduce the risk of prolonged infections and their potentially devastating consequences for &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.872542/full"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that other studies have also shown an association between the BCG vaccine, which protects against tuberculosis, and a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096999611730030X?via%3Dihub"&gt;decreased risk&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer’s (a type of dementia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inflammation and dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the new study’s finding of a link between the use of anti-inflammatory medications and a reduced risk of dementia, notably non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen were identified as potentially protecting against memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this is another piece of evidence suggesting that inflammation plays a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8775769/"&gt;central role in dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01486-5"&gt;Inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is the body’s natural way of defending itself against injury or infection. But when inflammation lasts too long, it can cause harm – particularly to the brain. Long-lasting inflammation releases chemicals that can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10419139/#:%7E:text=During%20neuroinflammation%2C%20the%20participation%20of,that%20lead%20to%20neuronal%20damage."&gt;damage healthy tissue&lt;/a&gt;. These chemicals can damage brain cells and disrupt communication between them, which leads to memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-inflammatory drugs work by blocking the production of certain molecules that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7192366/#:%7E:text=The%20aspirin%20study%20found%20that,of%20the%20results%20on%20NSAIDs.&amp;amp;text=This%20review%20found%20no%20evidence,studies%20of%20the%20same%20medicines."&gt;cause inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. By doing this, they might help protect brain cells from damage caused by long-term inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence for the benefits of other types of drugs on dementia risk was less consistent. The study found that certain blood-pressure drugs, antidepressants and diabetes drugs were linked to both a lower and higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible reason is that these prescription drugs affect different biological processes. Even drugs designed to treat the same condition may target different biological mechanisms, which might explain the varying results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some blood pressure medications – such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.19378"&gt;blockers&lt;/a&gt; (ARBs) – improve brain health by enhancing blood flow and reducing inflammation. On the other hand, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/40/Supplement_1/ehz748.0348/5598071"&gt;beta-blockers&lt;/a&gt; primarily lower heart rate and may not provide the same neuroprotective benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes drugs also had mixed associations with dementia risk. But as people with diabetes are already at a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11892-014-0487-z"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing dementia, this makes it difficult to determine whether this association was due to the effects of the drugs themselves, or if diabetes is the main factor at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, more research is needed to confirm this study’s findings and better understand how all these drugs appear to influence dementia risk. Randomised controlled trials will be crucial to see if these prescription drugs really can be repurposed to prevent dementia effectively. At the same time, looking into the biological mechanisms that are potentially affected by these drugs could shed light on the causes of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research highlights the importance of addressing inflammation and infections as part of a broader strategy for maintaining brain health. And by finding new uses for existing drugs, scientists could deliver treatments to patients more quickly – offering hope in the fight against dementia.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/248041/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/248041/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Bucks County are reporting &lt;a href="https://www.buckscounty.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1251"&gt;a new case of measles&lt;/a&gt; in a resident and are warning other people they may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus last week.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An adult resident tested positive for &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/measles-rubeola"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; after recently traveling to Texas, according to the county health department, and visited several locations back in Pennsylvania while potentially contagious.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said anyone who visited the Starbucks at 2896 S. Eagle Rd. in Newtown on March 19 between 10:50 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. could have been exposed. They should monitor for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;early symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including cough, runny nose, red eyes, headache, sneezing and a red skin rash, said county experts.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The health department has completed contact tracing at all other locations where this adult traveled upon returning to Pennsylvania. Officials said Thursday that anyone potentially exposed “will be notified.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles, which spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids or through respiratory droplets in the air, could start experiencing symptoms within 10 to 14 days after exposure, according to the health department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who begins to experience symptoms or feel ill should immediately contact their health providers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of infection or severe illness remains low among people who received the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends for children as young as 12 months old.

“It supports the creation of enzymes and hormones, boosts immune function, and helps transport nutrients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I'm not alone: Whether or not they know it, much of women in the United States are suffering from a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/protein-deficiency-signs" target="_blank"&gt;protein deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. “Inadequate protein intake can have widespread negative effects on the body, impacting multiple systems and functions,” says Barmmer, listing off a host of symptoms I'm simply not interested in, including feeling weak, reduced strength, brittle hair and nails, reduced ability to fight infection or illness, and mental fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to asking “how much protein do I need?” the nutritionist also shares some simple rules: If you're a sedndary adult, aim for 1 gram for every kilogram you weigh; if you're an active adult, 1.6 to 2.2 grams per every kilogram you weigh; and if you're over the age of 65, 1.2 to 1.5 grams per every kilogram you weigh. So if you weigh 165 pounds, that translates to 72.5 kilograms, so you're aiming for 72.5 grams of protein a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phew, this is even more intimidating than I thought! In an attempt to step up my protein game, Barmmer compiled a list of foods for me to eat as much as possible—and I'm sharing it with you. 2025 is the year of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to eating fish, not all have the same amount of protein. There are more than &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/102331/download?attachment" target="_blank"&gt;36 varieties that the FDA declares as healthy options&lt;/a&gt;, and the four that are the highest when it comes to protein are tuna (24.4g of protein in a 100 g serving for ahi tuna), salmon (25.92g in a 100g serving), cod (19.36 g of protein in a 100 g serving), and mackerel (25.45 g of protein in a 100 g serving).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hemp Seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These seeds may be tiny, but they are surprisingly mighty. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/18/3505" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/18/3505"}' href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/18/3505" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Two tablespoons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/hemp-seeds" target="_blank"&gt;hemp seeds&lt;/a&gt; have just as much protein as two egg whites—along with all nine essential amino acids (a rarity), omega-3, and omega-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eggs should absolutely be part of your weekly rotation, but you want to eat the egg with the yolk,” says Barmmer. In a large egg, you'll get about six grams of available protein. “Eggs also have a good dose of brain and liver and gall bladder supporting choline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nut butter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While they can and should be part of your rotation, don’t expect things like peanut butter to be a significant protein source in your diet,” levels Barmmer. "They will give a small boost but it simply requires too much in terms of volume and calories to reach your protein needs with them. For example, it would take 679 calories worth of peanut butter (7 tablespoons) to equal 175 calories of a 3-ounce serving of lean beef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quinoa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're gluten-free, plant-based, or on a whole foods diet, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/health-benefits-of-quinoa" target="_blank"&gt;quinoa&lt;/a&gt; should be a big part of your diet. “This grain-like seed is one of the few complete plant protein sources providing about 8 grams per cup,” says Barmmer. “It’s rich in magnesium and fiber as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Greek Yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thicker and creamier than regular yogurt because it's fermented for longer, Greek yogurt's health benefits far surpass the OG variety. “From a nutrition perspective, Greek yogurt typically has significantly more protein—often two times as much!—and fewer carbohydrates than regular yogurt,” says clinical nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1750952271/heather-a-hodson" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1750952271/heather-a-hodson"}' href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1750952271/heather-a-hodson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Heather Hodson&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, CDCES at NYU Langone Health. It's also a fantastic source of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/calcium-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;calcium,&lt;/a&gt; which helps maintain strong bones and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cottage Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big on social media recently, cottage cheese is having a come back. “Just half of a cup of cottage cheese can provide between 12 and 16 grams of protein,” says Barmmer. All you need to do is read the label. “It contains casein, a slow-digesting protein that supports muscle repair and growth. It’s filling and rich in calcium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Powders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein powders or collagen peptides are a great addition to you diet if you're looking to up your intake. “Collagen peptides are a convenient, bioavailable, and effective way to support your body's collagen needs, particularly as production naturally declines with age,” says Barmmer. “Adding them to your diet can help maintain youthful skin, strong joints, and overall connective tissue health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beef&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The debate on the sustainability of beef is nuanced and requires a separate discussion, but if you can put that aside and purely look at nutrition quality, it’s really difficult to beat beef,” Barmmer says. “This is one of the most nutrient-dense sources of protein available and is a great idea to include in weekly meal plans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 22:52:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE0xVi1xbVhRRmphV0tER0lpejBOU1BiVXpHaldlXzVpUEZJa3ZUMlRDUXJ2UHJ0QlI5bEpBM1FuaEVFam1RNFJkb1dhRjRoRDVyRlYzdFB1MEJwbHRK</guid></item><item><title>Measles - United States of America - World Health Organization</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFBqbDh4S01TaHA3cmZXR2QtU0o0NUQ3M2pnb0l6a0taYk1FRlhSLXNEVlFEQ2lnSzZwNWRHUG9JXzhxOGNJZEFLVVRHMEJiampGaWZMVXRSS3gxTnc3azRpTnFjNnFIeWhSV0Z4ZGs1cVlESHd4MExqRldB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="sf-detail-body-wrapper don-revamp"&gt;
        

                

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Situation at a glance&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p class="don-content"&gt;
            On 11 March 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) received a report from the International Health Regulation (2005) (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) of the United States of America (United States) on the ongoing measles outbreak in the country, notified under IHR because it is an unusual event with potential significant public health impact, with the number of cases and deaths in 2025 exceeding the numbers in previous years. Additionally, cases linked to the outbreak in the State of Texas, United States, have been reported in Mexico.
Measles is a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can lead to severe complications and death.
From 1 January to 20 March 2025, 17 States have reported a total of 378 cases of measles, including two deaths - the first deaths related to measles in the United States in a decade. The majority of cases are in children who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, and the overall hospitalization rate is 17%. In 2025, within the larger public health event, there are three distinct measles outbreaks reported, accounting for 90% (341/378) of reported cases. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (US CDC) and other government agencies are working to control the outbreaks. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated in the United States, since then imported cases of measles have been detected in the country, as the disease remains endemic in many parts of the world.  
WHO is working closely with countries in the WHO Region of the Americas to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles.
        &lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Description of the situation&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;On 11 March 2025, the NFP of the United States notified to WHO an ongoing outbreak of measles in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1 January to 20 March 2025, 378 cases have been reported from 17 States including: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York State, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. Two deaths have also been reported, one confirmed in Texas and one under investigation in New Mexico. The majority of cases are in children who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. The hospitalization rate is 17%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety percent of the 378 cases (341 cases) have been associated with three distinct outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases) reported in 2025, while the remainder are sporadic cases that are part of the larger outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From late January until 14 March 2025, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported 259 cases in the South Plains and Panhandle regions of Texas. Of these, 34 patients have been hospitalized, and 257 (99%) were unvaccinated or with unknown vaccination status. In February 2025, an unvaccinated school-aged child who lived in the Texas outbreak area died of measles. This was the first death in the United States related to measles in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 14 March, the New Mexico Department of Health reported 35 cases of measles. Of the 35 cases, 28 were unvaccinated, two were vaccinated, and five had unknown vaccination status&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1 January 2025 to 20 March 2025, the US CDC reported 128 measles DNA sequences. Texas submitted 92 identical DNA sequences in genotype D8; while 10 DNA sequences from New Mexico and one DNA sequence from Kansas were identical to those from Texas. Texas also reported three genotype D8 sequences (a total of 19 D8 sequences have been reported from the affected States) with single nucleotide substitutions. Additionally, a total of five distinct genotype B3 sequences were reported from the States of Alaska, California, Florida, Kentucky, New York, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of this outbreak is unknown. Currently, there is no evidence of decreased vaccine effectiveness or changes in the virus that would result in increased severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, measles was declared eliminated&lt;sup&gt;[1] &lt;/sup&gt;in the United States and, since then, imported cases of measles have been detected in the country since the disease remains endemic in many parts of the world.  The United States last verified the ongoing elimination of measles in 2024. In 2023, the vaccination coverage rate for two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine among children in kindergarten in the United States was 92.7%.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease which affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. The mode of transmission is airborne or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. The rash usually appears 10-14 days after exposure and spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. A person is infectious from four days before up to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles and most people recover within 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is usually a mild or moderately severe disease. However, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, secondary ear infection, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), blindness, and death. Postinfectious encephalitis can occur in about one in every 1000 reported cases. About two or three deaths may occur for every 1000 reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunization against measles prevents measles and its complications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Public health response&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal, State, local health authorities and community partners in the United States are implementing the following public health measures to control the outbreak: US CDC escalated to a level 3 Incident Management Structure on 3 March 2025 to provide remote technical assistance on diagnostics, post-exposure prophylaxis, healthcare infection and prevention, case investigation and confirmation, and communication support. The Texas Department of State Health Services is leading the investigation in Texas. US CDC deployed subject matter experts to assist the response. WHO has issued epidemiological alerts and updates due to the increase in measles cases in several countries in the WHO Region of the Americas that started in 2024. WHO continues to monitor the situation and work closely with countries in the Region of the Americas to support their vaccination, surveillance and rapid outbreak response efforts to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles and to protect the health of the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO risk assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally. The transmission mode is airborne or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. A rash develops several days later, usually starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards. A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment approved for measles; most people recover within 2-3 weeks. Measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, ear infection, and pneumonia, which are more common in children under 5 years and adults more than 20 years of age. Measles can be prevented by immunization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the Region of the Americas was the first WHO Region to be declared free of the endemic transmission of measles by the International Expert Committee for Documenting and Verifying Measles, Rubella and the Congenital Rubella Syndrome in the Americas. Nevertheless, maintaining the Region free of measles is an ongoing challenge due to the permanent risk of importation and reintroduction of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public health risk in the Region of the Americas for measles is considered high due to the persistence of the circulation of the virus from imported cases, which have resulted in a limited number of outbreaks, with several generations of cases and the appearance of cases associated with pre-existing outbreaks in new geographical areas. Additionally, an increase in the susceptible population due to persistently low vaccination coverage related to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, increased vaccine hesitancy in some communities and sectors of the population, and limited access to health services, particularly for vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO advice&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public and private healthcare facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance and preparedness and response capacities in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with continuous and effective communication channels across all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management and infection prevention and control capacity to avoid health care-associated infection transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to airborne infection isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends providing broad access to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to maintain high vaccination rates of the general population and to ensure individuals at high risk of exposure are up-to-date on this vaccination, such as health and care personnel and international travellers. Individuals living in outbreak areas within the United States should follow local public health guidance. Globally, between 2000 and 2023, vaccination successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and decreased an estimated measles death from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2023, which is an 87% decrease.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all settings, consideration should be given to providing susceptible contacts with post-exposure prophylaxis, including a dose of MCV or normal human immunoglobulin (NHIG) (if available) for those at risk and in whom the vaccine is contraindicated. In well-resourced settings, MCV should be provided to susceptible contacts within 3 days. For contacts for whom vaccination is contraindicated or is not possible within 3 days post-exposure, consideration can be given to providing NHIG up to 6 days post-exposure. Infants, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised should be prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the measles-rubella (MR) and/or MMR vaccine, and syringes/supplies for responding to imported cases. Facilitating access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to incoming and outgoing international travellers, including individuals due to perform activities, domestically or abroad, in areas with ongoing measles outbreaks, displaced populations, indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO advises international travellers to check and update their vaccination status against measles prior to departure, including when planning to travel to the United States. Unvaccinated individuals from areas in the United States experiencing measles outbreaks, with knowledge of exposure to measles cases and/or presenting signs and symptoms compatible with measles virus infection, should consult local health authorities before undertaking an international voyage. At present, no additional measures that significantly interfere with international traffic are warranted.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Around 12% of Americans have already tried this eating pattern, according to the &lt;a href="https://foodinsight.org/2023-food-and-health-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2023 International Food and Health Survey&lt;/a&gt;. But intermittent fasting isn't just one method. It includes various forms, such as alternate-day fasting, the 5:2 method, Ramadan fasting, and time-restricted eating (TRE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-restricted eating is among the simplest fasting methods. It typically means fasting for 12 to 20 hours daily, leaving a limited window—usually 4 to 12 hours—to eat. Many find this easier than counting calories or eliminating favorite foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People like time-restricted eating because they feel it’s easier to adhere to because they don’t have to think too much,” said nutrition expert Nadeeja Wijayatunga. “It’s all about time, not &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-research-debunks-myths-about-intermittent-fasting/"&gt;calorie-counting&lt;/a&gt; or watching out for certain foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how effective is this strategy when combined with exercise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Time-restricted eating has surged in popularity among weight-loss enthusiasts, but its effectiveness is still up for debate.

Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://olemiss.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; looked at 15 studies from the past decade. They analyzed what happens when healthy adults pair time-restricted eating with regular exercise. Results showed a clear advantage for people combining these two practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw that this did lead to more fat loss and reduced body fat percentage over time when healthy adults were following both exercise with time-restricting eating compared to those who were only exercising for at least four weeks,” explained Wijayatunga, an assistant professor of nutrition and hospitality management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="why_combining_diet_and_exercise_matters"&gt;Why Combining Diet and Exercise Matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many diet plans cause people to lose weight, but this weight isn't always fat. Losing lean mass—muscle, organs, and tissue—can negatively affect health. Lean muscles play an essential role in metabolism, strength, and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need healthy muscles,” Wijayatunga emphasized. “Muscles are really important for the body and for your metabolism. If we lose muscle, it may impact our metabolic systems, and it just decreases mobility overall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study’s results are encouraging because they show that combining exercise with TRE can prevent &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/scientists-discover-protein-that-could-restore-youthful-muscle-strength/"&gt;lean muscle&lt;/a&gt; loss. When participants combined exercise with an eight-hour eating window, they primarily lost body fat—not muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why you want to couple diet with exercise,” added Michael Hays, a tactical dietitian who co-led the study. “When you’re losing weight, you never want to lose lean tissue. You want to lose fat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_science_behind_the_success"&gt;The Science Behind the Success&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe the reason for this combined effect lies within the body's metabolic responses. Exercise and TRE seem to activate distinct biological pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Nadeeja Wijayatunga, assistant professor of nutrition and hospitality management at the University of Mississippi.

When you exercise regularly, muscle cells also become more efficient at taking glucose from the blood. They do this using a special transporter known as GLUT-4, which reduces blood sugar and improves &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/gamechanging-diabetes-discovery-could-lead-to-life-without-insulin/"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, TRE reduces overall insulin levels and increases fat breakdown. Lower insulin levels encourage your body to burn stored fat rather than sugar for energy. Combining these two practices creates a powerful effect, burning more fat while preserving muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="clarifying_mixed_findings"&gt;Clarifying Mixed Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research on time-restricted eating showed mixed results. Some studies reported reduced fat mass and better &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/global-study-links-height-to-heart-metabolic-and-mental-health-risks/"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. Others found no meaningful changes compared to standard diets. Yet another group of studies reported losing both fat and lean muscle or no change at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these earlier studies typically looked at diet alone or involved various fasting types. The University of Mississippi’s recent meta-analysis specifically looked at TRE combined with different exercise routines. Researchers found that TRE with exercise consistently led to greater fat loss and helped maintain muscle mass compared to exercise alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Forest plot for changes in body fat percentage.

They exercised regularly and had relatively low body fat before starting TRE.

Evidence clearly shows combining time-restricted eating with regular exercise could boost fat loss while protecting muscle mass. Yet, this is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and further research is still necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, if losing fat and maintaining muscle is your goal, pairing TRE with regular exercise might be an effective strategy.

                            &lt;p&gt;A flea-borne disease that was once largely eradicated from the U.S. may be making a resurgence, CDC researchers said during a clinician-focused call on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/about/murine.html" target="_blank"&gt;Murine typhus&lt;/a&gt; became so rare after public health efforts against it in the 1940s that it eventually stopped being a nationally notifiable disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, cases are on the rise in two states that actively monitor the disease  --  Texas and California  --  and the illness may be going undiagnosed, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Murine typhus is a disease that had all but disappeared from the United States and also disappeared from the minds of healthcare providers," said Johanna Salzer, DVM, PhD, a veterinary medical officer and lead of the epidemiology team for the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But it is clearly returning, and our understanding of the current burden is almost certainly underestimated," Salzer said during the Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) call. (This was the first COCA call held under the new Trump administration.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One event in particular caught the CDC's attention. In October 2024, an organ procurement organization in Texas notified CDC that a transplant recipient was hospitalized with murine typhus, according to Christopher Paddock, MD, the lead of the microbiology and diagnostic team at NCEZID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that patient recovered, a second transplant recipient who received an organ from the same donor developed severe disease and died 11 days after the transplant, Paddock said. They were confirmed to have murine typhus as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organ donor had died of an illness attributed to a non-infectious etiology, he added, but CDC testing confirmed the donor did indeed have murine typhus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paddock showed data from Texas that showed an uptick in murine typhus beginning around 2004, and the state has had between about 500 and 700 cases per year since 2018. California has had about 150 to 200 cases per year during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those levels are still well below levels from the 1940s, when there were 42,000 cases from 1931 to 1946; in 1944 alone there were 5,400 cases in the U.S.  --  but the disease may be going undetected, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This disease came roaring back in the last 20 years to levels that we haven't seen since the late 1940s," Paddock said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="module-group columns-group" data-preset="body-illustrated-list" data-type="synopsi" data-title="Medical News from Around the Web" id="recirculation-article-body" data-count="3"&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes the detections may be just the tip of the iceberg: "There's an adage in medicine that you see what you know, and this one I think really applies well to murine typhus."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murine typhus is a flea-borne rickettsiosis caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Rickettsia typhi&lt;/em&gt;. It mainly infects the rat flea and the cat flea, which despite their names, feed on a number of other animals, Salzer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infection occurs after contact with the feces of fleas, typically after being scratched into the skin, but it can also be due to mucous membrane exposure or inhalation of dried flea feces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs and symptoms usually start about 11 days after contact with infected fleas, and people with close contact with feral cats and rodents are known to be at the greatest risk of illness, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's considered more mild than other rickettsial illnesses such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, but it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the case fatality rate for murine typhus is estimated at 0.4%, said Lucas Blanton, MD, an infectious diseases physician at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. For those hospitalized with severe disease, the fatality rate can be about 2%, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blanton said he has treated "many, many cases" of murine typhus, which typically presents as an acute, undifferentiated febrile illness with generic symptoms that mimic many other infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most patients (87%) will have a headache, he said  --  often described as "the worst of one's life"  --  and most also have fever, chills, and myalgia (67%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While rickettsial illness is typically associated with a rash, only 48% of patients get a rash with murine typhus, he noted. Patients can also have gastrointestinal symptoms including anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. As the disease progresses, a little more than a quarter of patients (28%) will develop respiratory symptoms, typically a cough, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common lab abnormality is elevated hepatic transaminases, and patients can also have low albumin and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Complete blood count abnormalities include thrombocytopenia (42%), and possibly some slight anemia or leukopenia, and about a third will have hyponatremia, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, a patient can be sick with a fever for up to 3 weeks, he noted. Patients left untreated risk a worsening of endothelial dysfunction, as well as intravascular volume depletion that can lead to hypotension, organ dysfunction, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients should be treated with tetracycline antibiotics, preferably doxycycline, Blanton said. The adult dose is 100 mg oral or intravenous twice daily, and in children under 45 kg, 2.2 mg/kg oral or IV twice daily. If the patient's disease is severe enough for hospitalization, they should get a 200-mg IV loading dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't delay treatment while awaiting the results of diagnostic tests, Blanton urged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most cases have occurred in Texas and California, they could be going undetected in states that don't do surveillance, experts noted. Historically, Salzer noted, most cases occurred in the Southeast, particularly along the coasts of the Gulf states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not clear what's causing the rise in cases, but Blanton said it could be that cat fleas have found a new host  --  possums  --  and these animals are "very adapted to urban and suburban living."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salzer noted it could also be attributable to a rising awareness of the condition in states like Texas and California, which have "a more educated provider population that may be testing and looking for it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7231a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; detailed 171 cases in Los Angeles county in 2022, with three deaths among adults with underlying medical conditions. One person had experienced homelessness and another had reported contact with feral cats, Salzer said.&lt;/p&gt;

	Despite his allegiance to the conspiracist far-right and a &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-rfk-jr-mcdonalds-meal-seed-oil-1235169870/"&gt;McDonald’s visit &lt;/a&gt;with anti-vax health secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/elon-musk/"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; draws the line at claiming that vaccines are totally ineffective and potentially dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Earlier this week, Musk’s podcaster pal &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/joe-rogan/"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; hosted Dr. Suzanne Humphries, a nephrologist who co-wrote the self-published 2013 book &lt;em&gt;Dissolving Illusions: Disease, Vaccines, and the Forgotten History&lt;/em&gt;, which falsely claims that vaccines do not account for the decline of infectious diseases including smallpox and polio. In her interview, Humphries advanced her conspiracist narrative that medical researchers falsified their data in order to justify vaccinations, whereas what really made people ill were environmental toxins spread through poor sanitation and hygiene — which rapidly improved from the Nineteenth century onward, stemming the spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Humphries made one outrageously false claim after another on Rogan’s &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/podcast-2/" id="auto-tag_podcast-2" data-tag="podcast-2"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, at various points claiming that tuberculosis “was a side effect of the smallpox vaccine,” that polio cases were caused by the insecticide DDT, and that Covid-19 was lab-engineered to include “snake toxin proteins,” apparently echoing a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/covid-19-is-caused-by-a-virus-not-snake-venom-idUSL2N2WJ244/#:~:text=Reuters%20has%20previously%20addressed%20false,sodium%20acetate%20trihydrate%2C%20and%20sucrose." target="_blank"&gt;years-old conspiracy theory&lt;/a&gt; about people getting the disease from snake venom in drinking water. “I would have told you that vaccines are one of the most important inventions in human history,” Rogan told Humphries during their conversation, appearing to accept everything she told him as fact. “And it saved us from polio, it saved us from smallpox. I would have been that guy ranting off all those statistics. I would have told you that. But then I read your book.” He also said: “Giving a Covid shot to a baby today is insane.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“‘Dissolving Illusions’ is a really great book,” Rogan later &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/joerogan/status/1905249814251504058" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on X, sharing a post from a user who declared the Humphries episode “his most important podcast of the year.” He went on to note, “I probably would have never thought about exploring the real history of vaccines if we hadn’t gone through the insane Covid gaslighting of the last 5 years, but after Dr. Humphries’ book I’ll never look at it the same way again. She’s a very brave and brilliant woman.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Musk, a repeat Rogan guest who typically aligns with him on culture war issues — the pair also backed &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; in the 2024 election — pushed back on his social media platform, though still hedged slightly. “My opinion on the subject: If forced to choose between greatly improved sanitation and vaccines, sanitation matters much more,” declared the oligarch now overseeing the decimation of federal agencies and regulators by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “But vaccines, essentially training your immune system for battle, do work well for addressing many diseases. The essence of science is continuously looking at the evidence to lessen the error between your understanding of reality and reality itself.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Vaccines are a peculiar fault line within the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/maga/"&gt;MAGA&lt;/a&gt; movement that Musk and Rogan have joined. Trump, for instance, has sought to take credit for the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/covid-19/"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; vaccines developed during his first term, yet a significant portion of the GOP base now &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/23/gop-voters-vaccines-poll-00117125" target="_blank"&gt;distrusts vaccine science&lt;/a&gt;, turning it into a partisan issue since the advent of the pandemic. As head of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has already moved to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule for diseases including polio and measles, which this year has &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;infected hundreds and killed two&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;hired a discredited anti-vax researcher&lt;/a&gt; to study the long-debunked “connection” between immunizations and autism. Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-texas-kennedy-fox.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;misleadingly claimed&lt;/a&gt; that factors such as malnutrition or preexisting health conditions contribute to measles infections, and downplayed the possible effects of the disease, which can permanently blind or deafen patients who survive it, touting the benefits of natural immunity post-infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Similarly, Humphries seemed to suggest on Rogan’s podcast that polio is not the terror that many people imagine it to be, since most cases are asymptomatic. But in the mid-Twentieth century, it killed or paralyzed &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-polio-vaccination#:~:text=In%20the%20late%2019th%20and,the%20disease%20faced%20lifelong%20consequences." target="_blank"&gt;half a million people each year&lt;/a&gt; worldwide and was a major cause of childhood disability. The worst recorded outbreak in U.S. history, in 1952, saw 3,000 people die. Thanks to safe and effective vaccines that first became available in 1955, polio was considered to be &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/polio" target="_blank"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in North and South America as of 1994.





&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Musk has turned X, formerly Twitter, into a &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-twitter-misinformation-timeline-1235076786/"&gt;haven for misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, often amplifying such content himself. So it was no surprise that his gentle pushback on Rogan’s vaccine skepticism drew plenty of dissent in the replies. “I started down the vaccine rabbit hole after Covid-19, and I now suspect that we’ve been lied to on an industrial scale about them,” &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/Holden_Culotta/status/1905293633277788296" target="_blank"&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; a verified blue-check user with more than 100,000 followers. “I think the evidence, if we look at it honestly, shows overwhelmingly that vaccines are unnecessary at best, and have caused tremendous harm/negligible benefit at worst.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Given the kind of platform and audience he has cultivated, it doesn’t appear that Musk will be earning plaudits for going against the emerging consensus in his party that inoculations are worse than the diseases they guard against. It’ll certainly be surprising if he challenges this worldview again.&lt;/p&gt;

Reducing salt intake as a national guideline is also a safe bet for the population to achieve a healthier lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Plus, with our car-dependent, relatively sedentary lifestyles, the average American is at greater risk at overconsumption of sodium than underconsumption, says Raeeda Gheewala, a nephrologist and founder of the clinic Sports Nephrology. When it comes to the recommended 2.3-gram sodium limit, “I don't think it's too stringent in this country,” she adds. Eating at home is the easiest way to control how much salt goes in our food. To that end, “grocery shopping is the most important part of the process,” Gheewala says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 19:59:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPVEhSOEtXT0JwYVBjNElZa19FN1UzQkxHWjluaGd1X2h3QWhzcnNtOEJOMFZXelVtaDhiSFJXWXpmUTl5RHFKYlNLZVEzZXdHbzN0elVUc3Fqc3ZXTTBvZ0NaUGpxcThDa3VUSjh2Uk9GblJDMG9HLUphOEtjT3dIYk8yY3M5SlE</guid></item><item><title>Surge of dead birds on South Haven beaches, DNR urges caution - WWMT-TV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxPOXZKQldnOGhVeW9RLWRLY3kyS3AyQ3BxMFNHNE5PVHNPdFNBM1VlZzJsSFRGaGJORDZVSnhzNGlXc0c5TTVFdEV1VVNRUlV5eTRxN05BQ2ZUY3hSYVh6UmZwUmJrVk1aT0J2eWUxTmNaclNabUgxYTdIaDFuYWRTYUxLa2JrT0lQZHhHNmg1cGxQNGRGTTF0QThjcUs0VTk4TEtscjU1RnM5VEVpcERFTFBuek9fSlU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SOUTH HAVEN, Mich. — &lt;/span&gt;Residents of South Haven are expressing concern after discovering a large number of dead birds along shoreline, prompting fears of potential avian influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitty Girard, a South Haven resident, told News Channel 3 she and her husband Larry woke up to find bird carcasses sprawling the beach outside of their North Beach condo, leading her to wonder, "Could this be bird flu?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey of the area revealed more than 100 dead birds, a figure confirmed by the DNR, which said current estimates show at least 130 birds have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beachgoers are being urged by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the City of South Haven to avoid the birds whenever possible to prevent potential spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Michigan DNR is investigating the situation, saying that affected species include long-tailed ducks and murky Merganser, which are well-adapted to Lake Michigan's stormy conditions. For this reason, they said that highly pathogenic avian influenza is being considered as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of what we're looking at here and other potential specimens that ended up, we really are only focused on how highly pathogenic avian influenza has affected those wild birds," said Rachel Lincoln with the DNR's Wildlife Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNR said samples have been collected and sent out to the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostics Lab for testing, however, results may be delayed due to a nationwide outbreak backlog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh carcasses can carry diseases, but as decomposition occurs, the risk of virus transmission decreases, so leaving them to decompose naturally in remote areas where they "do not pose a risk" is best practice, according to the city and DNR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If disposal is necessary, according to the DNR, it is crucial for people to cover their skin completely, including wearing a mask, to double bag the carcasses and place them directly into the trash. Then, wash your clothes in hot water, dispose of items that touched the carcass, and sanitize your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City of South Haven said staff is continuing to monitor and clear public beaches, but private property owners are responsible for their own cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNR said that if you observe six or more dead birds in one area, you should report it on their "&lt;a href="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ors/Home" target="_blank" title="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ors/Home" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Eyes in the Field&lt;/a&gt;" platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about human health and safety should be forwarded to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services at 517-335-8165.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If bird flu is suspected in a domestic flock, contact Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) immediately at 800-292- 3939 (daytime) or 517-373-0440 (after hours).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WWMT-TV</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 19:38:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxPOXZKQldnOGhVeW9RLWRLY3kyS3AyQ3BxMFNHNE5PVHNPdFNBM1VlZzJsSFRGaGJORDZVSnhzNGlXc0c5TTVFdEV1VVNRUlV5eTRxN05BQ2ZUY3hSYVh6UmZwUmJrVk1aT0J2eWUxTmNaclNabUgxYTdIaDFuYWRTYUxLa2JrT0lQZHhHNmg1cGxQNGRGTTF0QThjcUs0VTk4TEtscjU1RnM5VEVpcERFTFBuek9fSlU</guid></item><item><title>My Daughter-in-Law Demands That I Babysit Her Toddlers for Days on End.

Our grandchildren are all grown, and one is expecting what will be our first great grandchild. Our son seemed to be a lifelong bachelor until he met and married “Stacy.” They currently have a 4-year-old and a toddler—and much as we adore them, it is very hard to be around them without help. We just don’t have the energy, mobility, and money to spare to spoil our grandchildren like we did their cousins back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

Our daughter-in-law will make backhanded comments about how our other grandchildren were obviously our favorites because we did things like watch them all summer or take trips to Disneyland. These days, it is very hard for either of us to bend down and pick up fallen items. When we go shopping, we need to use scooters because just crossing the grocery store is an ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqsk8z00273572evkrjein@published"&gt;This situation hurts us because our son keeps echoing his wife. We ended up having a huge fight because Stacy wanted to go to some convention and our son didn’t feel comfortable watching both children for a three-day weekend without help. My husband and I told him that wouldn’t be possible for us to come over and help. Firstly, their guest room is on the second floor and the stairs are steep. Plus, the guest bathroom is downstairs. We have to get up several times a night to use the bathroom. Our conversation got heated and then Stacy accused us out of the blue of trying to sabotage her career. Stacy has been trying to start her own business since she married our son and every attempt went nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

I understand it was hurtful, but I didn’t think it was enough for my son and his wife to completely cut us off. But they will not answer the phone and refuse to even send pictures of their children. We are heartbroken and our other children are furious at their brother. We don’t want our family to split apart over pettiness like this. We already sent Stacy a card and flowers for her birthday and apologized. No response. What else can we do?&lt;/p&gt;

More and more Americans these days seem to have &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-maha-mental-health-wellness-farms.html"&gt;the mistaken idea&lt;/a&gt; that any problem with your body is in your mind, surmountable if you really wish it to be, and perhaps that’s Stacy’s issue. But she had kids with a guy who had older parents. She’s &lt;a href="https://hmmdaily.com/2018/10/18/your-real-biological-clock-is-youre-going-to-die/"&gt;running up against biology&lt;/a&gt;, and in denial about what that actually means. Maybe she’s under a lot of pressure to show that she can succeed in her business, maybe she’s annoyed that her husband is apparently only minimally useful in the arena of childcare, or maybe she’s just plain unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="152" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqskn0002d3572dz6seqy5@published"&gt;I can’t figure out from afar what is wrong with this lady. But she’s married to your son—who, by the way, is the one who “doesn’t feel comfortable” watching the kids for three days without help. He could do any number of other things to fix this problem, besides expecting you to visit. My number one suggestion would be that he should simply buck up! But he could also hire paid outside help to come cover him for periods of time during the weekend, so he has rest breaks; or make plans to order in meals so he doesn’t have to cook; or band together with local parent friends to make plans to meet at a playground during the days, so he has some adult contact and a pressure valve for that much togetherness. Some combination of these strategies would be what a mother in this situation would do. Why can’t he?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqskpy002e3572zotlyku5@published"&gt;It also bothers me that your son doesn’t seem to register, or care, how big the disconnect between your reality and Stacy’s understanding of your life has become. The fight between Stacy and your husband is a red herring in this story, though it was likely hurtful of your husband to say what he said. It’s your son who’s the issue. I’m glad that your other kids seem to be more understanding of your situation. Perhaps they, who hopefully are not also blocked from his phone, could help explain it to him.&lt;/p&gt;

Their divorce was fairly civilized and I adore my nephews and nieces, so I often help out by dropping the kids off at school, babysitting, or helping her fix things around the house. Over Christmas, my brother unloaded on me, accusing me of disloyalty and “sniffing around” his ex, before demanding that I keep away from her and his kids. It was a very ugly scene, which really upset my parents, and I’m still chewing over it but I am also wondering whether I need to give in to his unreasonable and selfish demands. I don’t want to further inflame whatever is going on with him and his ex, or drag the kids into further drama, but I equally don’t want to just ghost my niblings or my sister-in-law. Do I just discuss it with her? I’d talk to my brother but, as you may have guessed, he’s not particularly reasonable or mature.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqslcs002k3572ml2vrpt6@published"&gt;Clearly there are things going on beneath the surface here with this divorce that are not “civilized”—not exactly. I would at the very least update your perception of this particular situation, from “they seem mostly fine” to “volatile; beware.” Your brother seems quite triggered by the idea that you’re doing the things he used to do—I bet he’s probably way more upset by “helping her fix things around the house” than by anything else on this list of acts of service. (Would he be this mad if you just did some school runs, barely speaking to her at all? I doubt it!) This is a fevered mindset he may come out of with time, but not one that will respond well to rationality, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqslen002l3572vvkbwy5v@published"&gt;Sadly, I do think you might need to wait a minute to go back to being “there” for them—or, find some ways to do this that don’t directly involve being around her, or being in her house. (Maybe the kids could come to your parents’ house without her, and you could see them there, for example.) I don’t think you should totally ghost her, though I bet if you did, she would be able to guess why you did it. You could let her know why you’re pulling back, and stipulate that you didn’t mind doing any of those jobs for her—and hope to be able to do so again in the future. This doesn’t have to be forever. But they are the ones who have to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

My two younger sisters did not get along with her husband’s daughter, “Julie.” I thought it was basic teenage drama until recently. Julie and my younger sister are both engaged. I have a different dad than my sisters and make a pretty good living working for him. I offered to give my sister around $10,000 for the wedding, since she and her partner are teachers and as poor as church mice.&lt;/p&gt;

Julie and I don’t have a relationship. I saw her a few times while she was still living at home, but we don’t even exchange Christmas cards. But she thinks I should pay for her wedding? I would basically tell Julie to get bent, but my mom isn’t in good health and doesn’t need this stress in her life. Her husband seems to have no spine when it comes to Julie. Both my sisters have stated they hate Julie and think she is a brat, but again are worried about our mom. My mom wants me to make a “better effort” here, but will not say what that is, besides just paying up the cash.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqsm0s002s3572b40e6dfg@published"&gt;It is hard for me to believe that this kind of faraway, quasi-stranger “sister” would dare complain about such a thing, but we get enough letters detailing similar situations that I guess it must happen! Obviously, you don’t need to give Julie money, let alone ten thousand big ones, out of some family connection that’s more legal and technical than it is emotional or even biological. You could toss her a Christmas card, sure, and certainly you should be civil and friendly when you’re in proximity to one another, for the sake of your relatives, but I think that’s the extent of your obligation to this person.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqsm33002t3572i4ghxaha@published"&gt;This problem is closest to your mom’s husband, and your mom’s husband needs to be part of the solution. He should care, too, about whether your mom is stressed! Why is that caring left up to you and your sisters? Can you talk to him and see if he can talk to Julie? Make it clear that Julie’s bad vibes are leaking onto your mom. I hope he’s ready to step up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8rqsm7w002v35727xvmjgtw@published"&gt;I found out that my 11-year-old child was pressured into riding in a car being driven by one of her friends, “Maria.” Apparently, Maria’s mother was not only aware of this but sent these two sixth graders in the car by themselves to run an errand for her while she was watching TV. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/05/underage-driving-confrontation-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;I found all this out when I saw Maria driving down the road with my 10-year-old neighbor in the passenger seat, and my daughter confessed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
