And yet, stomachaches are not typically a sign of this rare form of cancer at any point in its progression. Instead, the most common feature of the early stages of stomach cancer is that there are no symptoms at all, said &lt;a href="https://findadoc.bidmc.org/details/5623/umut-sarpel-surgery-boston" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://findadoc.bidmc.org/details/5623/umut-sarpel-surgery-boston" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Umut Sarpel, M.D." data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Umut Sarpel, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of the division of surgical oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"We all get stomachaches from time to time, and that can make people worry about stomach cancer," Dr. Sarpel said.

When it causes any, they are typically one of these six digestive problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="there-is-blood-in-your-vomit-or-stool" data-node-id="5" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;There is blood in your vomit or stool.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While both colitis and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a26024642/crohns-disease-symptoms-causes-treatments/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a26024642/crohns-disease-symptoms-causes-treatments/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Crohn's disease" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt; can cause bloody stool, it can also be a sign of cancer. Regardless, blood in either your poop or your vomit demands a visit to a GI doctor, Dr. Sarpel said. If the bleeding is related to cancer, the blood in your stool is likely to look maroon or tarry black. "It looks that way because it's been acted on by your digestive enzymes," she explained. If the blood is in your vomit, it's more likely to look bright red, and it may have a coarse "coffee grounds" texture because it has been partially digested, Dr. Sarpel added. &lt;br data-node-id="6.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-feel-full-after-just-a-few-bites" data-node-id="7" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;You feel full after just a few bites.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You were definitely hungry when you sat down to eat. But after a few bites, your appetite vanishes and the food isn't appealing. Dr. Sarpel called this "early satiety," and says it's another symptom that could—emphasis on &lt;em data-node-id="8.1"&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;—indicate stomach cancer. "Especially if feeling full really quickly is different than what you're used to, that's something you shouldn't ignore," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-have-constant-gnawing-stomach-pain" data-node-id="9" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;You have constant, gnawing stomach pain.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Yes, in some cases stomach pain is a sign of stomach cancer. But in most cases, your run-of-the-mill pain or stomach cramps are going to be the result of some other gut or abdominal ailment, not cancer, Dr. Sarpel said. If it is a result of cancer, the pain will be a consistent gnawing in the middle of your stomach, she added. "It's not something you feel for one day, and then it goes away for two weeks and comes back again." &lt;br data-node-id="10.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-lost-weight-without-trying" data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;You lost weight without trying.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Many health conditions—including &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65158472/new-treatment-type-1-diabetes-cure/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65158472/new-treatment-type-1-diabetes-cure/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="type 1 diabetes" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Addison's disease, and Crohn's disease—can lead to unexplained weight loss. Add stomach cancer to that list, Dr. Sarpel said. "If you're losing weight and not dieting, that's something to pay attention to," she explained. Be aware that the weight loss may be gradual. While you may not notice a sudden drop, you might step on a scale and find you've lost 10 pounds during the last 6 months. It is totally natural for your weight to fluctuate, but if the weight loss is noticeable and you haven't been doing anything that accounts for it, talk with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-have-frequent-unexplained-heartburn" data-node-id="13" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;You have frequent, unexplained heartburn.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a39761688/heartburn-relief/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a39761688/heartburn-relief/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Heartburn" data-node-id="14.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Heartburn&lt;/a&gt;, indigestion, and other common symptoms of an unhappy gut can also be early warning signs of stomach cancer, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/stomach-cancer/stomach-cancer-symptoms.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/stomach-cancer/stomach-cancer-symptoms.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas" data-node-id="14.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Again, Dr. Sarpel said these sorts of symptoms are much more likely to be something &lt;em data-node-id="14.4"&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than cancer. But it’s still a good idea to let your doctor know what’s going on, especially if they are constant and don't seem to be caused by consumption of specific foods and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-experience-regular-bloating-diarrhea-and-constipation" data-node-id="15" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;You experience regular bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It makes sense that a cancer growing in your stomach could make you feel bloated, or mess with your bowel movements.

Many fertility doctors worry that holistic methods are being presented to patients as a better alternative to IVF, thereby denying patients access to a proven option in fertility care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e39843" class="body-graf"&gt;“Restorative approaches may work for certain patients, but elevating them as morally superior or universally preferable undermines the individualized, evidence-based care modern reproductive medicine is built on,” said Dr. Brian Levine, the founding partner of CCRM Fertility of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-e7e26c"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1467" data-original-width="2200"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg" alt="President Trump Signs Executive Orders At Mar-a-Lago In Palm Beach, Florida"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;President Donald Trump delivers remarks after signing an executive order on access to IVF at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 18,  in Palm Beach, Fla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Joe Raedle / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b2ff4" class="body-graf"&gt;After Trump issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/expanding-access-to-in-vitro-fertilization/" target="_blank"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; in February promising to make IVF more affordable and attainable, Republican lawmakers introduced companion bills in the House and Senate that would expand access to restorative reproductive medicine and prohibit discrimination against providers who don’t offer IVF. And in June, Arkansas became the first state to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/05/infertility-treatment-restorative-reproductive-medicine-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;require insurance companies&lt;/a&gt; to cover restorative reproductive medicine treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e94159" class="body-graf"&gt;Recent actions out of the Department of Health and Human Services suggest an aligned interest in holistic fertility methods. Calley Means, a special government employee at HHS, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6371907617112" target="_blank"&gt;told Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in April that there was a “mandate from the top” to come up with “a holistic fertility policy.” That same month, HHS &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdcs-ivf-team-gutted-even-trump-calls-fertilization-president-rcna199261" target="_blank"&gt;laid off the team&lt;/a&gt; responsible for tracking IVF success rates as part of the agency’s massive restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b48f7" class="body-graf"&gt;Then in July, HHS &lt;a href="https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/359991" target="_blank"&gt;posted a grant opportunity&lt;/a&gt; for an “infertility training center” that would educate people on a “broad range of holistic infertility treatments.” The proposed center would draw from federal Title X funds, which have historically been used to provide birth control or testing for sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ec01a" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, said the agency released a forecast for a future funding opportunity but is not currently soliciting applications for an infertility training center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd9eec" class="body-graf"&gt;“HHS is committed to prioritizing helping couples suffering from infertility,” Nixon said, pointing to Trump’s executive order on IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c3a96" class="body-graf"&gt;Some IVF supporters say they sense indecision within the Trump administration over how to proceed with a federal policy, despite the president calling himself the “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-father-ivf-recently-learned-rcna175940" target="_blank"&gt;father of IVF&lt;/a&gt;.” (Decades of research laid the foundation for IVF, but the first successful IVF pregnancy took place in England in 1978.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-b86cbf"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1467" data-original-width="2200"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/250228-IVF-aa-1033-4e7f02.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250228-IVF-aa-1033-4e7f02.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/250228-IVF-aa-1033-4e7f02.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250228-IVF-aa-1033-4e7f02.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250228-IVF-aa-1033-4e7f02.jpg" alt="Doctors hands removing embryo samples from cryogenic storage"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Doctors hands removing embryo samples from cryogenic storage, Fertilized embryos are stored in liquid nitrogen filled tanks to keep them as new if patients require them at a later date. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Universal Images Group / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6c48fa" class="body-graf"&gt;The White House Domestic Policy Council, which advises the president on domestic issues, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-ivf-recommendations-fertility-clinic-bombing-1e7a626e88d7d7a120b0c4a7ba6f8314" target="_blank"&gt;presented Trump with policy recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for supporting IVF in May. Dr. Kaylen Silverberg, an adviser to that council and a fertility specialist at Texas Fertility Center, said he recommended to White House officials that they declare infertility an essential health benefit under the Affordable Care Act and cover IVF services for military and government employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14abad" class="body-graf"&gt;But The Washington Post &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/08/03/trump-administration-ivf-care/" target="_blank"&gt;reported Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that the White House does not plan to require health insurers to cover IVF services, a policy Trump previously said he would implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca500f" class="body-graf"&gt;Silverberg said White House officials haven’t told him which policies they favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d300f4" class="body-graf"&gt;“They come at me with very insightful questions, but they don’t give me anything,” he said. “If I say to them, ‘Hey, what are you thinking about such and such?’ The pat answer that I get back is, ‘Well, we’re listening to lots of different sources, and we’re trying to formulate the best solutions that we can.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5438b" class="body-graf"&gt;The White House said it has met with stakeholders across the spectrum to solicit their input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-742d81" class="body-graf"&gt;“President Trump pledged to expand IVF access for Americans looking to start families, and the Administration remains committed to delivering on that pledge and exploring all options that address the root causes of infertility,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3eb9af" class="body-graf"&gt;Restorative reproductive medicine may indeed be one of those options. The International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, the professional association for doctors who offer this type of fertility care, has spoken with federal officials about its methods, said Dr. Tracey Parnell, the institute’s global director of communications and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c454f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Parnell, who is Canadian, coined the term “restorative reproductive medicine” in the late 1990s alongside a small group of international physicians. She was surprised earlier this year when her community became part of the national conversation in the U.S., she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2cb5ce" class="body-graf"&gt;“We were sort of expecting another decade to be able to get to the stage of more published information and further along the pathway to formal recognition as a specialty,” Parnell said, noting that such recognition in the U.S. requires accreditation by a national board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-563af9" class="body-graf"&gt;One group responsible for increasing the visibility of restorative reproductive medicine is the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank whose policy proposals are known to influence the White House’s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23e49c" class="body-graf"&gt;In March, the foundation &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/report/treating-infertility-the-new-frontier-reproductive-medicine" target="_blank"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; highlighting what it said are the benefits of restorative reproductive medicine over a fertility industry that “profits from the creation and selection of human life.” The report emboldened groups that are morally or ideologically opposed to IVF, said Levine, of CCRM Fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-47625d"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1466" data-original-width="2200"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg" alt="House Democrats Holds Press Conference On World IVF Day"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;People hold signs in honor of World IVF Day in Washington, D.C., in 2024. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Tierney L.

Kennedy Jr., also favor holistic methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-72efc0" class="body-graf"&gt;In late June, the Heritage Foundation and the MAHA Institute — a policy center that backs initiatives that align with the MAHA movement — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhlr3aVJKOQ" target="_blank"&gt;held a roundtable discussion&lt;/a&gt; on women’s fertility. Many of the speakers there advocated for restorative reproductive medicine and warned of the risks of hormonal birth control. At least one high-powered federal official, the Food and Drug Administration’s principal deputy commissioner, Sara Brenner, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apRJ9RpdTDc&amp;amp;t=151s" target="_blank"&gt;was in attendance&lt;/a&gt; and expressed support for the topics discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6c34b4" class="body-graf"&gt;“The goals of the Make America Health Again movement — to return to holistic, root-cause medical care for men and women — align with the goals and approach of restorative reproductive medicine, even if there are notable differences and distinctions between those two movements,” said Emma Waters, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f98f96" class="body-graf"&gt;Parnell, of the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, said the group’s methods don’t prevent people from pursuing IVF, but rather give them options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d812b8" class="body-graf"&gt;Practitioners of restorative reproductive medicine say their methods are individualized to the patient and don’t rush to diagnose women with infertility if they can’t conceive right away. They often ask patients to carefully track their menstrual cycles, body temperature and changes in cervical mucus to help determine when they’re ovulating. They also look to diagnose and treat medical conditions that may impact fertility, such as polycystic ovary syndrome or endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54d901" class="body-graf"&gt;Where necessary, practitioners may suggest changes to patients’ diets, recommend vitamins or supplements or prescribe hormone medications that improve ovulation. In some cases, they may advise surgery to diagnose endometriosis and remove scar tissue that can block an egg’s path to the uterus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cee8e" class="body-graf"&gt;But IVF doctors said the restorative approach can take time&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; which some patients may not have if they have a diminished number or quality of eggs. Many of the tactics of restorative reproductive medicine, like prescribing hormones or dietary changes, are already used in fertility clinics nationwide, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7af863" class="body-graf"&gt;Silverberg, of Texas Fertility Center, said restorative reproductive medicine is “a made-up term for something that’s been going on for decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-adc35f" class="body-graf"&gt;“My concern is that the people who focus solely on restorative reproductive health want things to stop right there. They unfortunately advocate ignoring all of the medical advances that have happened in the last 40 years,” Silverberg said, adding that he shared these thoughts with White House officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fb1b25" class="body-graf"&gt;Monica Minjeur, the U.S. director of communications and development for the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, said there is data to show that the approach works. In a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2018.00210/full" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 400 women with a history of infertility, most of whom had been unsuccessful with IVF, roughly 32% gave birth after turning to restorative reproductive medicine. The odds of having a child via an additional cycle of IVF were roughly the same, according to the paper, which Parnell co-authored. (The average &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4934614/" target="_blank"&gt;success rate of a woman’s first IVF cycle&lt;/a&gt; is around 30%.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-398e54" class="body-graf"&gt;Despite its conservative fan base, Minjeur said, restorative reproductive medicine is not inherently political or religious, and her organization is cautious about these associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5e17a9" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We are a science-based medical organization who is trying to just get the good word out to the people,” she said. “If and where that aligns with government priorities to help people who want to build families, great, we’ll take it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQRUYxekYxN0JTVzQyNk1aT0U0Wkk5YlJkcDlXeE0ySWNmYlZjTldCNkp1WXhMeksyUDFDZmNWcGxLN0g2aDg4d1MwcjFZY0dmUWdrRGtCNDV1eXAxdEpoWDhpbzFOUldtV2hqUVRPc0JiSXdwX2dJVC1PRkEzZFM1SDlJc1hHRGNTbFZGZ1VmZlh3RDRGT2JhRXRaN09MdFFzV1FwTmx4M0pCVTlfc0NDZFhqVFYzcXg4bjNLOExad9IBVkFVX3lxTFBHVTZoYVA5OWFxbldobG1rSUtLMFNUcTZxZDN1TVJFWkJLSlVZQzRWTy1CN2xZWl9aMWp2WGhUa1l0YlRUeDJPbUVuZElnekZwT092VDhR</guid></item><item><title>具有基因编辑细胞的糖尿病患者自行生产胰岛素-无需移植药物- Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxNRnZCcWIxSXBlaU54SG5zbVdib3RuOUxrM1lVMncwT1N5RldSdi13Ynk0WUwtVmtHYVlxLW1tZEhwMFFQb2I0OEpHU2U2OGhzZWtWckdKaDMxa1A0cU5vaXluU05lWGlCUXBhRTZqMVZMVDE1Tml4V3ZPcHdqWG80aDFBQlNPY1MxVlY0MEEzOXRVRHJJcVc3TW5Yc2ViNFAxS1lyczF4VGFDTEs5V0M4TXdnQ3VFeGE4VVNwSg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A new case study offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential future of transplantation medicine. A man with type 1 diabetes is now able to make his own insulin thanks to a transplant of gene-edited pancreatic cells—a transplant that hasn’t required the typical drugs used to avoid rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Sweden and the U.S. conducted the research, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2503822"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. The 42-year-old man with long-standing diabetes was given donated islet cells that were genetically modified via CRISPR to prevent immune rejection. Roughly four months after the procedure, his fully gene-edited cells have continued to produce insulin without provoking an immune response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our study, although preliminary, suggests that immune evasion is an alternative concept for the circumvention of allorejection,” the authors wrote in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with type 1 diabetes have immune systems that destroy the pancreatic cells responsible for making insulin. The condition can be managed with regular doses of synthetic insulin, but people’s health still tends to worsen over time. Recently, scientists have been studying whether donated islet cell transplants can provide a self-sustained replacement supply of insulin for type 1 diabetics—an effective cure, in other words, provided the cells can survive long-term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early clinical trials of the technology have &lt;a href="https://news.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-presents-positive-data-zimislecel-type-1-diabetes"&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; promising so far, but these transplants still require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to ensure the host’s body doesn’t go after the donated cells. Effective as these drugs are, they have their well-known drawbacks, such as weakening people’s immunity to actual threats like infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers have been experimenting with a unique approach to sidestep the need for these drugs. They first tested it on mice and monkeys, with this new case being the first test in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They created three specific edits in the donated cells, all intended to quiet the most likely responses from the immune system. Two of the edits deplete the cells’ supply of HLA class I and II antigens, proteins that tell our T cells whether another cell is foreign or not. A third edit causes the donated cells to make more of another protein called CD47 that inhibits the activity of other immune cells that would normally target them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers injected the modified cells into the man’s forearm. The edits weren’t completely successful in some of the cells, and the man’s immune system quickly killed off these cells. But as hoped, his body left the fully edited cells alone, even without immunosuppressants. The surviving cells produced insulin as normal, and the man appeared to be doing well 12 weeks later. He did experience several adverse events, but none were serious or linked to the transplanted cells themselves (he had mildly inflamed veins where a catheter was placed, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This study is only a proof of concept, geared more at showing the procedure can be done safely than at proving it actually works. The man was given a relatively low dose of the donated cells, likely too low for his body to produce enough insulin on its own to no longer need treatment. Follow-up is also needed to know whether these cells can survive long-term.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there’s much to be encouraged about. And it’s the latest sign that scientists are truly on the verge of making type 1 diabetes curable. Other research teams have shown early success in using similar transplants to cure the condition, including some that have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/in-medical-first-womans-type-1-diabetes-seemingly-cured-by-stem-cells-2000506407"&gt;also avoided needing&lt;/a&gt; immunosuppressant therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

Florida has seen 16 cases this year, according to the state’s health department. &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Seventeen cases have been reported in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; — more than previous years’ annual averages. North Carolina has seen seven cases this year so far, the state Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to NBC News. And Mississippi has had three cases so far this year, the state’s health department says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e1578" class="body-graf"&gt;Initial deaths from the infection in Florida were reported in counties spread around the state’s extensive coastline, from Bay County in the Panhandle and Hillsborough County, where Tampa is, on the Gulf Coast, to Broward County in Southeastern Florida and St. Johns County just south of Jacksonville. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d2b49" class="body-graf"&gt;The bacteria can get into the body through open wounds in the skin and cause the surrounding tissue to die, a condition known as necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; People can also get Vibrio vulnificus from eating contaminated foods, particularly raw oysters. It’s unclear how the people in Florida were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63a2b5" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1 in 5 people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70793b" class="body-graf"&gt;Antarpreet Jutla, an engineering professor at the University of Florida, said that infections are still rare but “something is off this year.” Still, he said there are too many unknowns to be certain what's causing the rise in infections at this time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e2f9dc" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is certainly not normal, that’s one thing,” Jutla said. “We haven’t had that many cases early on in the summer for a very long time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-658b95" class="body-graf"&gt;Jutla said Vibrio vulnificus infections tend to increase after hurricanes. Last year, Florida saw a total of 82 cases, which may have been exacerbated by the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/hurricanes/hurricane-season-ends-rcna181808" target="_blank"&gt;“extremely active” hurricane season. &lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hurricane-idalia-concerns-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna102181" target="_blank"&gt;bacteria can linger&lt;/a&gt; in hurricane floodwaters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74b11d" class="body-graf"&gt;“Something happened this year that triggered the pathogens a little bit more than before,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44b37a" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/prediction-remains-on-track-for-above-normal-atlantic-hurricane-season" target="_blank"&gt;Hurricane season this year&lt;/a&gt; is still expected to be above normal as the U.S. enters its peak period, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5e444" class="body-graf"&gt;Jutla’s research group is investigating why there are high concentrations of plankton and chlorophyll — indicators for vibrio — across Florida’s panhandle. He calls it a “concern.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-509d8f" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Vibrio vulnificus? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c5f2e3" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is one of over 200 species of Vibrio bacteria, said Rita Colwell, a professor emerita of microbiology at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84ef02" class="body-graf"&gt;The majority of Vibrio infections aren’t harmful to humans, Jutla said. Some only affect other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6854d5" class="body-graf"&gt;But Vibrio bacteria do cause about 80,000 infections in people each year, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Most of those cases are gastrointestinal. Only a small handful — 100 to 200 cases — are due to Vibrio vulnificus. Other Vibrio species, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus, are often the cause of those stomach illnesses. Another type of Vibrio, Vibrio cholorae, causes the diarrheal disease cholera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3aeee6" class="body-graf"&gt;Because Vibrio bacteria prefer warm water, they are typically found along the southeastern shores of the U.S., but they are also found on the West Coast. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/fear-warming-oceans-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna75935" target="_blank"&gt;As ocean temperatures warm&lt;/a&gt;, more cases have been found farther north in recent years, Jutla said, including some in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/3-people-die-flesh-eating-bacteria-infections-new-york-connecticut-pro-rcna100364" target="_blank"&gt;New York, Connecticut and Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b78964" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd93ce" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio bacteria can creep in open wounds after spending time in salty or brackish water, said Dr. Norman Beatty, an infectious disease doctor at University of Florida Health. Most cases he’s seen have been associated with spending extended time in the water, but he says that even a brief exposure could be the “only thing needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a7a11" class="body-graf"&gt;Visible signs of an infection can start in just a few hours, Beatty said, and include redness, swelling and “bull’s-eye” blisters. The site will also be painful. If infection progresses, it can get into the bloodstream and cause sepsis, which can be deadly. Symptoms of sepsis include fever, chills and dangerously low blood pressure, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18ecdc" class="body-graf"&gt;People with liver cirrhosis, weakened immune systems and those over 65 are most at risk for infection, Jutla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d8a29d" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus infections can be treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-5fd37e" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prevent Vibrio infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a21ff4" class="body-graf"&gt;Beatty said he recommends covering up any open wounds before going into the ocean. Even a waterproof Band-Aid does the job, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46f0fc" class="body-graf"&gt;If people think they have an infection, they should seek care immediately, Beatty said. Delaying can be the difference between developing severe complications and a more mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-55bfe4" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“A delay in presenting to health care is truly the likely reason why most people have a more serious outcome than others,” he said. “People who present within the same day with signs and symptoms of early infection, who receive antibiotics, can do well and can avoid a lot of these serious complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 13:10:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNOS1RWW9yLUhxMDJjZzU2TGZ4M25vNzRVWHktLXZWUmNRNWRqcWZhZDZEZnN6M1VBSlB6bENzeFpxTW5VZXFpM2NqNFZfQ1Q3ZHlnMnBHUDYtU1A1R0tEbFBJTC1jRlhJMjRCMndoOFl5WndTR0tValg0U2FNVVNydF9WMklmckRReEh1d3Zrb1pnNjdNTHkyVUVpc3lhb2h2SUgyTTJCZlRtR0XSAVZBVV95cUxPemRIXzRpNUpxRnBZTW1KRnN2a0JaY2lxeUZWYTgxT1pOMDdiWjUydVJZNVFmZnVoVkRMMXdpdkhFTmlrOVZXQWNKQk55YkY5MENndkt0QQ</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法， 6种预防脑雾的食物- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1ack9YZFQwbmsxOW1zTVJVdHRwd3FCaGI4eGpiRm5zVUoyMzVLd1JfaG5JVFJ3Wk5NSjdjRDFWbE1lbjI4YmxRWDA2WFQtOTYzcENlR0JNYWJKcHRsSEI2Rm9GUFJHZUFaWXktMi1sUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brain fog is that mentally fuzzy feeling that makes it difficult to think clearly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One study found it may affect nearly 30% of people. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RDs say eating leafy greens, berries, fatty fish, mushrooms and nuts may offer protection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve ever walked into a room and forgotten why you entered, or spent hours searching for that one thing that you just&lt;em&gt; know &lt;/em&gt;is somewhere (but where?!), you may be suffering from brain fog. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Brain fog isn’t a formal medical diagnosis per se,” says &lt;a href="https://www.wendybazilian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Wendy Bazilian, Dr.P.H., M.A., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “But many people use it to describe that frustrating feeling of mental fuzziness—when your thinking feels slower, your memory feels off [with] little mental blips or delays.” If you can relate, you’re not alone. One recent study of more than 25,000 adults found that 28% of them &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-cognitive-decline-11767736" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reported experiencing brain fog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Luckily, what you eat plays a role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-eat-every-week-for-better-brain-health-11784254" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;keeping your brain sharp&lt;/a&gt; and your memory in tip-top shape. To find out the foods you should be eating for better mental clarity, we dug into the research and talked to registered dietitians. Here’s what you need to know.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-dark-leafy-greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Dark Leafy Greens  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Time and time again, studies looking at the best foods to preserve cognition reinforce that we should be eating dark green leafy vegetables every day, if possible,” says &lt;a href="https://maggiemoon.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bazilian echoes the importance of eating your greens (which is why they’re at the top of our list!). Consider the results of this study, she says: “Older adults who ate just one serving of leafy greens a day experienced slower decline in memory and thinking skills compared to those who rarely ate them. In fact, the difference was so striking that their brains functioned as if they were 11 years younger.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers hypothesize that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants in leafy greens&lt;/a&gt;, including lutein, alpha-tocopherol and kaempferol, help keep brains sharp as we age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But those antioxidants aren’t the only reason greens help keep your brain clear and sharp. “[Greens] provide folate, vitamin E, carotenoids and flavonoids, which improve the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the brain, and help address neuroinflammation that can diminish cognitive performance,” notes Moon. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are so many different ways to eat your greens, even if you think you’re not a fan. Toss them into a green smoothie, scrambled eggs, pasta or a salad. And don’t be afraid to experiment to find the ones that work for you. Kale, bok choy, collard greens, Swiss chard, spinach and arugula are all winners.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re feeling forgetful or fuzzy, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fruit-to-lower-dementia-risk-11777712" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;berries can help&lt;/a&gt;. Bazilian likens eating them to upgrading a processor on an old computer, where “tasks that were slow or glitchy before become smooth and responsive.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Berries are packed with brain-supporting nutrients, like fiber, vitamins, minerals and polyphenols. They are also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-antioxidant-rich-foods-you-should-eat-11776388" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rich in antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; called anthocyanins that are linked to better brain health, particularly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-to-improve-your-memory-8415078" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;improved memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your main brain fog symptom is feeling mentally sluggish, wild blueberries might help rev things up. In a randomized control trial of people over 65 years old with mild cognitive issues, those who consumed wild blueberry powder daily for six months experienced improvements in mental processing speed compared to those who took a placebo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While wild blueberries have higher concentrations of anthocyanins than regular blueberries, all berries are believed to do good things for brain health. And they don’t have to be fresh to do their thing. When fresh berries are out of season, look for frozen berries and whir them into smoothies or stir them into yogurt. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-mushrooms"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Mushrooms  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may not think of mushrooms first when it comes to healthy foods to add to your diet, but these fungi are powerful. “Mushrooms are often a forgotten food in the U.S., but they deserve our attention for their potential brain-health benefits,” notes Moon. “Their bioactives may lower inflammation and oxidative stress common to mental fatigue.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, research has linked mushroom consumption with cognitive performance, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-mistakes-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-11779797" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better memory and executive function&lt;/a&gt; among middle-aged and older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, a culturally adapted version of the MIND diet that includes several weekly servings of mushrooms has been associated with better cognitive function in observational studies, adds Moon.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, different mushrooms have different nutrients and bioactive compounds. So, aim to eat a variety of your favorite mushrooms a few times a week. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There are dozens of individual studies on cognition and walnut consumption, and the science suggests a positive relationship between nut intake and cognitive performance,” says Bazilian. This is likely due to walnuts’ plant omega-3s in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) plus antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t just eat walnuts to sharpen your brain today. Longer-term, walnuts may also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7909431/have-a-family-history-of-dementia-or-alzheimers-heres-how-to-protect-your-brain-as-you-age/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;decrease the risk of developing brain disorders&lt;/a&gt; like Parkinson’s disease, depression and stroke.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, they’re a tasty, convenient snack. But walnuts are also a fantastic way to add a healthy crunch to yogurt, oatmeal, energy bites, salads, pasta and more.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s not surprising to see &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-fish-regularly-8677271" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fatty fish like salmon and sardines&lt;/a&gt; on a list of the best foods to prevent brain fog. Fatty fish deliver &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age-11739345" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;DHA and EPA&lt;/a&gt;, long-chain omega-3 fats that may improve learning, memory and overall well-being by increasing blood flow to the brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Neurons need omega-3s like we need good cell service—it makes a big difference in how well they can connect and work together,” explains Moon. “Omega-3s also have anti-inflammatory properties the brain needs to recover from daily wear and tear or other stressors that may contribute to brain fog.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moon’s pick? Sardines. “Sardines are low on the food chain for sustainability, but high in omega-3s for brain health.” Other &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-types-of-fish-for-brain-health-8609071" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3-rich fish&lt;/a&gt; include salmon, mackerel, herring and anchovies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While technically not a food (we know, we know), water is so important for your brain. “Mild dehydration is directly linked to having a hard time focusing, thinking, learning and remembering,” says Moon. The result, she says, is that hungover, foggy feeling that makes it difficult to think straight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The impact of dehydration is so profound that one study of older adults found that poor hydration increased their risk of cognitive decline. Conversely, additional research has linked hydration to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-in-the-morning-for-better-cognitive-function-11689092" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better cognitive performance on tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If drinking enough water feels like a challenge, Moon says all forms of fluid work. Whether it’s coffee, green tea, 100% orange juice, cucumbers, watermelon, grapes or tomatoes, there are lots of foods and drinks that can help you get the fluids you need to stay on the ball.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have brain fog, you’ll be happy to know that there are foods that may help you think more clearly. Research has shown that leafy greens, berries, mushrooms, walnuts and fatty fish can all help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;keep your brain in top shape&lt;/a&gt;. While these foods aren’t magic, including them in a healthy eating plan may help keep your brain sharper, faster and less foggy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A healthy diet is like your brain’s personal assistant, giving it all the nutrients it needs to perform its best,” says Moon. “What we eat can be just as important as what we limit, so that we aren’t overburdening the brain with additional metabolic stress that can exacerbate brain fog.” In addition to loading up on these brain-supporting foods, try to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911108/best-and-worst-foods-for-brain-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;limit foods and ingredients linked to poorer brain health&lt;/a&gt;, like added sugars, refined grains, alcohol and saturated fats. And don’t underestimate the power of hydration, as dehydration can mess with learning and memory. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  While you’re at it, why not keep your brain in top shape in other ways? Getting enough sleep, moving your body and limiting stress (to the best of your ability!) can also keep your brain on top of its game. Then, get ready to say bye-bye brain fog and hello mental clarity.

They found that CRC screening, which was at 20% in 2021, jumped to 37% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 45- to 49-year-olds, colonoscopy screening increased by 43%, and stool-based testing increased more than five times from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Jessica Star, associate scientist at ACS in Atlanta, considers it "thrilling" to see this increase in screening among younger individuals, as it's likely linked to earlier-stage diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we still have a long way to go," she said in the release. "Screening for colorectal cancer in ages 45 to 49 remains suboptimal, and has not increased equitably by both educational attainment and insurance status."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The study findings support efforts for everyone in the 45 to 49 age group to have access to screening.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul E. Oberstein, M.D., medical oncologist and assistant director of the Pancreatic Cancer Center at NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center, said the increase in screening is "successful in detecting more cancers at an early stage where the chance of cure is very high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This ultimately should mean that fewer people are diagnosed later in life and fewer people have advanced colon cancer," Oberstein, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study reinforces the need to focus research on understanding the causes of colon cancer increases – and possible steps to reduce these cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Individuals of all ages should contact a doctor if colorectal cancer symptoms arise, an oncologist said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of colon cancer in those under 45 remains "substantially lower," he noted, "so it is not clear yet if universal screening at a younger age is beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some specific patients who are younger than 45 may benefit from earlier screening, however, such as those with a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:family history;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;family history&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cache Creek Casino Resort, a 659-room luxury hotel featuring legal gambling in the unincorporated community of Brooks, issued the statement in collaboration with the Yolo County Health and Human Services Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the statement, officials said casino staff “are conducting contact tracing to identify and notify individuals who may have had close contact with the affected person. Health authorities define close contact as having a cumulative exposure of at least eight hours to the individual with (tuberculosis).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; said the tuberculosis bacteria can be spread through coughing, sneezing or speaking with others nearby. Coughs that last three weeks or longer, chest pain, and coughing up blood all are symptoms of the infection, the agency said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, appetite loss, chills, fever and night sweats. The CDCP also said many people who catch the bacteria for tuberculosis never show symptoms and have an “inactive infection” that is not contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The casino urged employees and those who have stayed at the resort in the past three months to contact their health care provider. They said that urgency is even higher for people with a compromised immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials did not say how they came to find out about the exposure or when it happened. A message left for the casino on Thursday was not returned immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health on &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/TBCB.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; said 2,100 people caught tuberculosis in California last year, 10 fewer than in 2023. Twenty-six of those cases were children under 5 years old.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the state’s annual incidence rate of 5.4 cases per 100,000 persons is nearly double the national rate, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

            This week, President Donald Trump called &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-operation-warp-speed-vaccine-summit/" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Warp Speed&lt;/a&gt;, a public-private federal program that helped speed up the development and distribution of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in record time “one of the most incredible things ever done in this country.” It was just a day after US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the federal government was canceling a half-billion dollars in investments into the same technology, saying no new mRNA projects will be initiated under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme20x0nl00053b6n1nt6jnl2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine and preparedness experts said the decision could be disastrous for the United States, rendering another Operation Warp Speed impossible in case of threat from disease or bioweapons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Kennedy, who has a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/21/politics/fact-check-rfk-not-anti-vax/index.html"&gt;long history&lt;/a&gt; of spreading vaccine misinformation, incorrectly suggested in his announcement that mRNA vaccine technology is ineffective, unsafe and unethical — comments that experts worry will put a chill on development even beyond the projects the government cut.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme24vxur00003b6nlvsy8zkz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the cancellation, Kennedy said the decision was based on a review of science and expert opinions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme23t7mt0004336nf01efs8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Let me be absolutely clear: HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,” Kennedy said in this week’s announcement. “That’s why we’re moving beyond the limitations of mRNA and investing in better solutions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm20008336n016zn7s4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said funding will be shifted “toward safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate,” such as whole virus vaccines, which use a weakened or deactivated version of a virus to trigger immunity. China developed a whole virus Covid-19 vaccine, but studies showed it wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00410-2/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;nearly as effective&lt;/a&gt; as the mRNA vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm20009336n5pgtycy9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I wonder why we want to try and go back to the way it was in the 1940s when we had vaccines, but it took a really long time to make them,” Dr. Cynthia Leifer, a &lt;a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/research/cynthia-leifer-phd" target="_blank"&gt;professor of immunology&lt;/a&gt; at Cornell University said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000a336n6u8l1lo8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She equates the abandonment of mRNA research at this point to partially paying for a kitchen remodel and stopping to save money after the walls have been demolished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000b336nebpfxlc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’d be out your money and you don’t have a kitchen,” Leifer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The mRNA vaccine platform is uniquely suited to protect a country during a pandemic, said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of the &lt;a href="https://pandemics.sph.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Pandemic Center&lt;/a&gt; at the Brown University School of Public Health. Not knowing what will cause the next pandemic, she said, “mRNA vaccines offer real flexibility that other vaccine approaches don’t.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000d336n7cxxth2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For a flu vaccine, for example, makers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7047267/#:~:text=To%20egg%20or%20not%20to,sometimes%20it's%20a%20lot%20different." target="_blank"&gt;use eggs&lt;/a&gt; to grow the virus. It’s a complicated process that may require several months to make enough, Nuzzo said. But mRNA vaccines can be developed much faster, sometimes even in days, and don’t require time to grow virus cultures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000e336n1cxv0tuj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When making an mRNA vaccine, scientists take messenger RNA, a single strand of the genetic code, that can teach cells how “read” and make a protein that triggers an immune response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000g336nkc3cisul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota epidemiologist,  said the decision to “wind down” the government’s investment in mRNA vaccines is one of the worst public health decisions in decades, particularly for pandemic preparedness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000h336n4r7m3wuw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Osterholm, who is the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholdm-phd-mph" target="_blank"&gt;founding director&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy&lt;/a&gt; and author of the forthcoming book&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph/the-big-one/9780316258340/" target="_blank"&gt; “The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics,”&lt;/a&gt; said vaccines are a “very, very small part of the pharmaceutical industry’s portfolio” since there’s not a lot of profit in vaccines. It’s government money that drives companies to make them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1zg98f0016336n8v283a64@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some mRNA projects are funded through other parts of the government, but Kennedy’s announcement may undermine mRNA vaccines in general.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000j336nzhov2hcv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The constant undercutting of support for vaccines is really a challenge. So the damage was twofold,” Osterholm said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000k336nfj3162it@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we had another pandemic today, we would have to watch large parts of the world not get vaccinated for several years and based on what’s just happened, the United States would probably be at the end of the line, not the head of the line like it was in Covid.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000l336ni0ope4w6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nuzzo said it’s possible another pandemic may not happen during Trump’s term, but the decision leaves the US vulnerable in another way: Retreat from investment in mRNA vaccines may even be seen as an opening for an attack.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1zmptt001a336nl4tpxaoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Defense posturing and defense preparation are the best form of deterrence for a biological attack,” she said.“It sends a bad signal to our adversaries about our commitments to protecting ourselves and our vulnerabilities to attack, let alone it stifles medical innovation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme26r5ss000g3b6n98u2yklb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Leaders in the Trump administration have pushed to bring drug manufacturing to the United States but experts say the choice to stop investing in mRNA vaccines will do the opposite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000n336nfcaxqxga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/16/us/katalin-kariko-covid-19-vaccine-scientist-trnd"&gt;Dr. Katalin Karikó&lt;/a&gt;, who shared the Nobel prize in 2023 for her pioneering work on the mRNA vaccines, told CNN this week that she moved to the US from Hungary because America offered opportunities to develop innovative science. US scientists in the same position today will not see the same opportunities, she said, and they’ll go where there’s investment in their work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme1z0hm2000o336nntrx2sjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is really the next generation that will suffer the most,” Karikó told CNN, Wednesday. “When we have the next pandemic other countries will have to help us out.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

She was in a graduate program, was working full-time, and had just been the maid of honor at her childhood best friend’s wedding. She was also only 28 years old. “It felt like absolutely everything about me was stripped away at that moment,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;She moved home to begin treatment: six months of chemo, a lumpectomy, and radiation.

Since 1990, the global incidence of early-onset cancer (cancers diagnosed in people younger than 50) has increased by nearly 80 percent and is projected to rise by another 31 percent by 2030, according to a study in &lt;em data-node-id="2.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="BMJ Oncology" data-node-id="2.1.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;BMJ Oncology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And compared to men under 50, women of the same age have an 82 percent higher rate, up from 51 percent in 2002, according to the American Cancer Society’s most recent &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/2025CancerFactsandFigures" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pressroom.cancer.org/2025CancerFactsandFigures" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="annual report" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;annual report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-21" data-node-id="4" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;Roughly 103 out of every 100,000 individuals below the age of 50 is diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;On top of all that, young people’s cancers tend to be more aggressive, often because they’re diagnosed at later stages. Colon and rectal cancers lead the uptick with the fastest rate increases, followed by uterine, blood (leukemia), kidney, and breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Traditionally, one of the biggest risk factors for cancer has been age.

(Screening ages for some cancers have begun to inch down, but general recommendations haven’t dipped below 40.) For example, people at average risk are advised to start &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a32998464/chrissy-teigen-pap-smear-mammograms-instagram/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a32998464/chrissy-teigen-pap-smear-mammograms-instagram/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="mammograms" data-node-id="10.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;mammograms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/american-cancer-society-recommendations-for-the-early-detection-of-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/american-cancer-society-recommendations-for-the-early-detection-of-breast-cancer.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="between the ages of 40 and 45" data-node-id="10.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;between the ages of 40 and 45&lt;/a&gt; and colorectal cancer screenings &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="at age 45" data-node-id="10.7" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;at age 45&lt;/a&gt;, according to the American Cancer Society. These ages are recommended partly because of the burden that earlier screenings would put on the medical system and because screening technology that works for older people might not be as effective on younger folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Mammograms, for one, aren’t as reliable in younger women, who tend to have &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62138347/dense-breasts-mammogram-fda/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62138347/dense-breasts-mammogram-fda/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="denser breast tissue" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;denser breast tissue&lt;/a&gt;, says Ann Partridge, MD, MPH, interim chair of the department of medical oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and cofounder and director of the Program for Young Adults with Breast Cancer. “You’d be looking for needles in haystacks, unfortunately,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There’s still a lot more that researchers need to learn about which individuals are most at risk so they can start screening those candidates earlier. In the meantime, it might feel tempting to turn to pricey private companies that offer cancer-screening blood tests (like Galleri) or whole-body MRI scans (like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45530775/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-review/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45530775/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-review/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prenuvo" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Prenuvo&lt;/a&gt;), but those are not quite ready for clinical application yet, says Veda Giri, MD, a medical oncologist and director of the Early Onset Cancer Program at Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-23" data-node-id="13" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;"I honestly don’t even think it crossed doctors’ minds that I could have cancer."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But while we wait for better research, tumors in adults under 50 are only getting bigger—and their symptoms more severe. “If a colon cancer is diagnosed at 42, it wasn’t due to screening; it was due to symptoms,” says Therese Bartholomew Bevers, MD, medical director of the Cancer Prevention Center at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For Jenna Putala, 27, a diagnosis took years to receive. Throughout her college softball career she was riddled with unexplained injuries and other health problems that sent her to an orthopedic surgeon and a neurologist. “No one did any scans,” she remembers. “Doctors just told me, ‘Move on, keep stretching, you’re fine.’” It wasn’t until last year, when a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62754772/chiropractor-cervical-neck-adjustment-stroke-risk/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62754772/chiropractor-cervical-neck-adjustment-stroke-risk/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="chiropractor" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;chiropractor&lt;/a&gt; sent her for an MRI of her back (where the pain originally was), that a scan showed the tip of an eight-centimeter tumor lower down, on her pelvis. Doctors think she’s been living with this PEComa, a rare form of sarcoma, since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Because of the tumor’s size, its placement, and her age, doctors don’t want to remove it; it would alter her quality of life too dramatically. She could lose part of her bowel or sciatic nerve or her pelvis could cave in on itself. Instead, Putala attempted to harvest her eggs to preserve her fertility (but couldn’t because it turned out her tumor was estrogen-sensitive), underwent 40 rounds of radiation, and is on chemo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For the rest of her life, to keep her cancer as manageable as possible, she’ll get regular screenings, go to physical therapy, and try different chemo treatments until they stop working or make her too sick to continue. Today, Putala is back at work and fighting for a sense of normalcy after a “whirlwind” year, but that doesn’t make her prolonged diagnosis any easier to swallow. “I honestly don’t even think it crossed doctors’ minds that I could have cancer,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This is really a moment for everyone to rethink who a cancer patient is. Young women with no family history or obvious risk factor like smoking—women who are doing everything right—are still being diagnosed, so doctors and patients alike shouldn’t rule out the possibility. “I was a college athlete, I went to the gym all the time, I ate healthy,” Putala says. “I was doing all of these things that could help prevent cancer, so why did I get it?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-24" data-node-id="19" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="collage combining human features and elements representing health" title="collage combining human features and elements representing health" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feacancer-003-6893a0c9e275e.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feacancer-003-6893a0c9e275e.jpg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feacancer-003-6893a0c9e275e.jpg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feacancer-003-6893a0c9e275e.jpg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Blake Cale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-hunt-for-the-cause" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;The Hunt For The Cause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Doctors are racing&lt;strong data-node-id="21.1"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to figure out why cancer rates are rising, but the unsatisfying truth is that there’s not much experts know for sure yet.

Compared to past generations, people today are consuming UPFs at younger and younger ages, potentially meaning that the damage is starting earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;These dietary habit changes can affect our &lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-024-00177-0" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-024-00177-0" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gut microbiom" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;gut microbiom&lt;/a&gt;e, inflammation, and insulin levels—all of which can play a role in developing cancer, says Jeffrey Meyerhardt, MD, MPH, codirector of the Colon and Rectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Younger generations may differ in body composition as well. From 1990 to 2020, adult obesity has doubled while childhood obesity has quadrupled, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight#:~:text=Worldwide%20adult%20obesity%20has%20more,16%25%20were%20living%20with%20obesity." target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight#:~:text=Worldwide%20adult%20obesity%20has%20more,16%25%20were%20living%20with%20obesity." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World Health Organization" data-node-id="24.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has linked obesity with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6754861/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6754861/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="13 different kinds of cancer" data-node-id="24.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;13 different kinds of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, including colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian. “We think it’s because having extra body weight can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64040296/chronic-inflammation-anti-inflammatory-habits-doctors/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64040296/chronic-inflammation-anti-inflammatory-habits-doctors/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="chronic inflammation" data-node-id="24.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;,” says Dr. Bevers. Extra weight might also impact sex hormones, which play a role in some cancers, and insulin levels, which can be a growth factor for cancer, says Dr. Meyerhardt. (On the other hand, muscle is actually associated with improved insulin sensitivity, he says.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;No surprise that physical activity also probably has a hand in this. Moving—and exercise—are thought to decrease cancer risk because of their effect on the factors we’ve been talking about: inflammation, insulin, body composition, and hormones, says Dr. Meyerhardt. While it doesn’t explain the rising cancer rates in younger people specifically, globally, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-06-2024-nearly-1.8-billion-adults-at-risk-of-disease-from-not-doing-enough-physical-activity" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-06-2024-nearly-1.8-billion-adults-at-risk-of-disease-from-not-doing-enough-physical-activity" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="one-third of adults" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;one-third of adults&lt;/a&gt; didn’t meet the recommended physical activity levels in 2022. That’s up by about five percentage points from 2010, and this number is expected only to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;These potential risk factors leave us with as many questions as answers, especially among people who have none of them. “Diet, activity, obesity—that’s not going to explain everything,” says Dr. Meyerhardt.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-what-can-you-do-now" data-node-id="28" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;So, What Can You Do Now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Bear in mind:&lt;strong data-node-id="29.1"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Cancer at younger ages is still not super common. (We’re talking roughly 103 out of every 100,000 individuals, according to a study in &lt;em data-node-id="29.3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808381" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808381" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="JAMA Network Open" data-node-id="29.3.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.) Rather than freaking out (because who wouldn’t?), it’s best to focus on being proactive, says Dr. Giri. There are things you can do—and they’re all pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="30" class="body-h4 css-8naf72 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="30.0"&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="30.1"&gt; Keep up with the basics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s not the most exciting thing you’ve ever heard, but the core tenets of Healthy Living 101 apply here. Eat well (focus as much as possible on whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limit highly processed foods, sugar, and red meat); hit 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity each week; get the recommended vaccines, especially for HPV; and avoid smoking and drinking as much as you can. Alcohol and tobacco are Group 1 carcinogens, per &lt;a href="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/list-of-classifications/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/list-of-classifications/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the IARC" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;the IARC&lt;/a&gt;, which means there’s sufficient evidence to classify them as carcinogenic to humans. UV light is also a Group 1 carcinogen—so protect yourself from the sun too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="32" class="body-h4 css-8naf72 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="32.0"&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="32.1"&gt; Flag your symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Any new lump, unexplained weight loss, change in bowel habits (like blood in your stool or black tar-like stools), abdominal pain, or cough is a symptom to take seriously, says Dr. Bevers. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms-of-cancer.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms-of-cancer.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society" data-node-id="33.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; also lists fatigue or extreme tiredness, eating problems, skin changes, unusual bleeding or bruising, and bladder changes as potential signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That might sound like a broad list, but the bottom line is this: “Whether it’s a new lump, a new pain, a new discomfort—something that’s just different and not going away—be sure to bring it to your doctor,” says Dr. Giri. Feeling like something is off can give rise to a range of emotions, she adds, including fear, guilt, and shame, but it’s important to not let that stop you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s a rule Harris has lived by ever since her diagnosis. After she offhandedly mentioned to her doctor that her throat swelled and felt itchy one evening while at a friend’s house, her doctor sent her for an ultrasound, which is how they discovered her thyroid cancer. Now, “any small concern—even if I think it might sound stupid, even if it’s embarrassing, I really don’t care—I bring it up to my doctors,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And if you mention it to your physician and they blow it off or their recommendation doesn’t help? “Don’t feel discouraged. Bring it back to them,” says Dr. Giri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="body-h4 css-1ho78k8 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="37.0"&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="37.1"&gt; Get a clear picture of your risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Risk assessment is a key to avoiding a too-late diagnosis and to giving yourself more options, and it’s something anyone and everyone should be doing, per experts. When Alison Hall, 33, calculated her breast cancer risk assessment score—using the same free online tool that &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60189322/olivia-munn-luminal-b-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60189322/olivia-munn-luminal-b-breast-cancer/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Olivia Munn" data-node-id="38.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Olivia Munn&lt;/a&gt; used (the &lt;a href="https://magview.com/ibis-risk-calculator/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://magview.com/ibis-risk-calculator/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Assessment Calculator" data-node-id="38.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Assessment Calculator&lt;/a&gt;)—she discovered that she had a 36 percent risk, which is a low score on a math test but high when it comes to cancer risk. A doctor told her to start getting biannual screenings. Her first mammogram was clear, but an MRI just six months later found cancer in its earliest stage of malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hall opted for a double mastectomy. “I don’t want to spend the rest of my life looking down at my breasts and wondering what is going on in there,” she says. Plus, the alternative, a lumpectomy and 5 to 10 years of hormone therapy, would delay her family planning by several years (and might have raised the risk of a recurrence during or after pregnancy, as a result of fluctuating hormones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="40" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;A large part of calculating your risk involves understanding your family history of cancer—which isn’t always easy to do. You can plug this info into an online risk calculator, like the one Munn and Hall used, Dana-Farber’s &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/community-health/assess-your-risk" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.dana-farber.org/community-health/assess-your-risk" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Assess Your Risk" data-node-id="40.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Assess Your Risk&lt;/a&gt; tool, the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/family-health-history/communication-resources/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/family-health-history/communication-resources/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="My Family Health Portrait: Cancer Edition" data-node-id="40.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;My Family Health Portrait: Cancer Edition&lt;/a&gt; (an app), or the ACS’s &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/cancer-risk-360.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/cancer-risk-360.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CancerRisk360" data-node-id="40.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;CancerRisk360&lt;/a&gt;. But ideally, once you’ve gathered your data, you can bring it to your doctor and ask about next steps. “I certainly didn’t have this on my bingo card, but the earlier that things are caught, the better,” Hall says. Instead of being scared by the prospect of finding things out, she says, “see it as something you can be empowered by.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="42" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;How To Find Out Your Family History&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For people with a family history of certain cancers—including breast, ovarian, uterine, and colorectal—screening and testing might be recommended at younger ages, even up to 10 years earlier than when your relative was first diagnosed. But that means finding out your family’s health history. There are plenty of reasons someone might not be able to access much info about their blood relatives’ medical histories, and that’s okay, says Dr. Giri. Doctors are able to work with the info you do have and can help sleuth out as much as possible. But here’s what to aim to get details on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="44" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="44.0"&gt;If you can speak to relatives about their health history, find out this info:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="45" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="45.0"&gt;Ask if they ever had cancer, what kind it was (keep in mind that sometimes people have multiple types, which is helpful to know), and the age they were diagnosed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="45.1"&gt;Inquire about your grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins (living and deceased). Sometimes doctors can identify generational patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="46" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="46.0"&gt;Ease into the conversation with these strategies:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="47" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="47.0"&gt;Think about the best people to turn to, both in terms of who you suspect will be most receptive and who will have the most information. Some families have one person who knows a lot about the entire clan, Dr. Giri says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="47.1"&gt;Be strategic about when to talk—when everyone is around for the holidays, or in private with certain people? Hard conversations like those about health and cancer might need to unfold over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="47.2"&gt;Be prepared to explain why you’re asking.

Once the mosquito population surges, it takes just one infected traveler from India or Thailand to kickstart local transmission. We’ve seen similar patterns in France, Italy, and now in Florida, where U.S. officials are reporting dengue cases.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ciprg" data-offset-key="bt5ca-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bt5ca-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bt5ca-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Leshem added that China has implemented a wide range of response strategies. “These include conventional tactics like spraying insecticides, draining standing water, using mosquito nets, and applying repellents. But in typical Chinese fashion, there are also strict public health enforcement measures: people face hefty fines for keeping water-filled flower pots, mosquito-eating fish are being released into ponds, and in some cases, patients are being hospitalized against their will.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ciprg" data-offset-key="5kh4l-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5kh4l-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5kh4l-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;While the risk of a similar outbreak in Israel is currently low, Prof. Leshem cautioned that it’s not out of the question. “We know these types of mosquitoes are present in Israel, and from time to time, we do identify chikungunya cases. It’s certainly a possibility, as we saw with last year’s West Nile virus outbreak.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ciprg" data-offset-key="6k2dk-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6k2dk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6k2dk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Chikungunya is spread by infected Aedes mosquitoes—the same species responsible for transmitting dengue and Zika viruses. Symptoms include high fever and debilitating joint pain, which can last for months.

                            &lt;p&gt;What is most fascinating about Ozempic isn’t the weight loss. It’s the psychological revolution it has triggered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something extraordinary is happening to people who’ve spent years, even decades, locked in a mental war with food. Again and again, I hear the same phrase from the medicalised weight-loss army: the “food noise” has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when the jabs stop? &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/ozempic-patients-need-support-for-a-year-after-treatment-xhh9fhsp8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A recent report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; suggested that patients may need a full year of support after coming off Ozempic. I’d say that’s the bare minimum. Because once the food noise returns, so does the weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients plan to taper off gradually, while others hope to stay on a maintenance dose indefinitely. But for many, going off the drug brings a risk of “Ozempic rebound” — the return of weight and cravings. Sustaining weight loss typically requires lasting lifestyle changes, as most users report a surge in appetite once the injections stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there are also accounts from people who say their cravings never returned, even after discontinuing the medication. If true, this raises a critical question: are these drugs doing more than suppressing appetite in the short term? Could they be reshaping long-term behaviour and not just altering brain chemistry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some slim people seem oddly irked by Ozempic. We’ve long treated body weight as a reflection of character. Thinness is seen as discipline, virtue, self-control. Obesity is framed as a moral failure — greedy, lazy, slobbish. Katie Hopkins once &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/british-tv-personality-katie-hopkins-gained-lost-weight/story?id=28216895" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; to prove how easy it is to lose weight by deliberately gaining it. She had to force herself to eat, found the whole process unpleasant and difficult, and eventually, after much effort, she gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for a whole cohort of people, the reverse is true. They live in a near-constant state of hunger, tormented by a 24/7 food soundtrack. And still the weight piles on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozempic challenges this old narrative. Suddenly, it’s not about willpower or virtue — it’s about biology. And the implications go far beyond individual weight loss. The potential public health benefits are huge: lower rates of diabetes, heart disease, and even some obesity-related cancers. This could be the next statin or thalidomide. We don’t know yet, which is why we need to think very carefully about how we are using these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because we still have no quality research to show what happens in the long term. And already, serious concerns are emerging. The &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6jg6nw2zeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of North Lanarkshire nurse Susan McGowan, 58, last September is believed to be the first in the UK officially linked to weight-loss medication. And across the country, regulators have now received &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2025/jun/concerns-grow-as-slimming-injections-tied-to-more-than-100-uk-fatalities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of more than 100 deaths potentially linked to drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro — though these cases remain unconfirmed and may involve other contributing health factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also countless reports of people self-medicating online. Singer Avery &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFVjSc5pUjJ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recently revealed&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram that she developed osteoporosis at 30 after taking a weight-loss drug without a prescription. “I DO have an eating disorder, and I did NOT get Ozempic from a doctor. It is very easy to get,” she said.  Online self-medication isn’t new. What’s new is how easy it has become, and how little scrutiny there seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question now is not just what happens next, but how we support people when the drugs wear off, stop working, or begin to cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Americans have never heard of it. But this neglected tropical disease is no longer confined to the tropics. It’s here, in the United States, spreading silently in wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease can lie dormant in the human body for years before leading to heart failure, stroke, arrhythmias, or sudden death. Once symptoms appear, the damage is often irreversible. The parasite is spread by &lt;a href="https://kissingbug.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;triatomine insects&lt;/a&gt;, also known as “kissing bugs,” which feed on the blood of infected animals like raccoons, opossums, and rodents. They defecate near the bite, and if the feces enter broken skin or mucous membranes, the parasite can infect humans. In rare cases, it has also been transmitted via organ transplant, blood transfusion, and congenital exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Chagas disease is endemic to Latin America and a major public health concern there, it remains largely overlooked in the United States. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cme/chagas/lesson_1/7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; estimates that around 300,000 people living in the United States are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Many were born in endemic regions of Mexico, Central America, and South America, yet most don’t know they are infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the popular idea that this disease only affects immigrants or travelers is dangerously outdated. My research confirms that T. cruzi is actively circulating in U.S. wildlife, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12233274/?utm_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found infected kissing bugs and mammalian hosts in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7470559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7470559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/4/06-1002_article?utm_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, and now the &lt;a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-medical-entomology/volume-62/issue-3/tjaf018/Trypanosoma-cruzi-Kinetoplastida-Trypanosomatidae-in-the-Midwest--prevalence-among/10.1093/jme/tjaf018.short?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;While Trypanosoma cruzi in raccoons and triatomine bugs doesn’t guarantee human infection, the ecological conditions for spillover already exist, and in some cases, transmission has likely occurred. A recent review in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/14/7/901" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; found about 90 confirmed or suspected locally acquired Chagas cases in the U.S. between 2000 and 2020, mostly in Texas but also in Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, and California. More recently, a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0012920" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;field study&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, revealed that nearly 35% of triatomine bugs collected inside homes tested positive for T. cruzi, and 23% had fed on humans, confirming direct human-vector contact and ongoing potential for unnoticed transmission. A 2022 study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35731040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; about 10,000 locally acquired cases in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although locally acquired Chagas cases remain relatively rare in the United States, some researchers are beginning to raise concerns that could shift this dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nwdistrict.ifas.ufl.edu/phag/2021/10/01/chagas-disease-a-health-risk-for-rural-people-in-the-southeastern-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;University of Florida Extension report&lt;/a&gt; states that the risk of human contact with infected triatomine bugs may increase in areas where homes border wooded landscapes or include features like dog shelters, poultry sheds, or stacked firewood. These environments create ideal hiding spots and blood sources for the insects, raising the chances they’ll enter homes. As climate change and land development reshape ecosystems, monitoring these risk factors is critical to staying ahead of potential disease spillover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s worse is how unprepared we are. Most doctors in the U.S. don’t consider Chagas disease in their differential diagnoses. Routine testing is nearly nonexistent. There’s no standardized national surveillance, and most infections are only discovered incidentally, such as during blood donor screening. By then, it’s often too late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even among those familiar with Chagas, there’s a misconception that it’s rare or imported. My fieldwork contradicts that narrative. If raccoons in rural Illinois are carrying this parasite in such high numbers, what does that mean for human exposure? People living in rural and wooded areas, hunters, campers, and agricultural workers are all potentially at risk, especially as triatomine bugs expand their geographic range due to climate change and environmental shifts.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The CDC has published data and guidelines on T. cruzi, but much of the clinical community remains unaware of the disease’s domestic relevance. This knowledge gap is both preventable and dangerous. Every year we delay action, we miss opportunities for early detection, treatment, and public education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be clear, Chagas disease is treatable if caught early. Antiparasitic medications like benznidazole can reduce parasite load and prevent progression, particularly in children and newly infected patients, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. But we must first recognize it exists here, and test for it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solution is not panic but preparation. We need:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awareness campaigns to educate clinicians and the public&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Expanded diagnostic access, especially in high-risk regions&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Targeted screening for patients with unexplained cardiac issues in endemic zones&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Continued wildlife surveillance to monitor spread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My experience as a research scientist showed me that the line between neglected and recognized diseases is not biology, it’s attention. Chagas disease has all the warning signs of an emerging public health crisis: silent spread, climate-driven expansion, low awareness, and long-term health consequences. What it lacks is urgency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this before. Covid-19, mpox, and now rising tick-borne diseases, all emerged from complex relationships between humans, wildlife, and environmental change. Trypanosoma cruzi is no different. It’s not a matter of if this becomes a bigger problem in the U.S., but how soon, and whether we will be ready. It’s time to stop underestimating Chagas disease and start treating it like the threat it truly is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Esther Onuselogu, M.Sc., is a biological sciences researcher with a focus on public health. Her thesis is on Trypanosoma cruzi infection in U.S. wildlife. She is passionate about infectious disease awareness and public health equity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The human brain tends to slow down as we age — even healthy brains shrink. That can make learning and memory harder as people age. But some people's brains shrink more slowly than their peers. This lucky group is called "SuperAgers." They're people aged 80 or older. But they have the memory abilities of someone 50-to-60 years old. This week in the journal Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia, researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.brain.northwestern.edu/superaging/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Northwestern University's SuperAging Program&lt;/a&gt; summarized some of the secrets they've learned in the last 2.5 decades.   &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to hear about more stories about human health and aging?

No one is champing at the bit to declutter that closet, deep clean the bathroom or finally tackle that inbox stuffed with thousands of unread emails. But did you know that you might be putting off doing things that can make you happier? It seems counterintuitive, but this week we looked at why people delay experiences that could bring them joy, and asked experts how we can break out of the cognitive trap that’s holding us back.

When these sleep issues persist for several months or longer, it’s usually a good idea to visit a doctor to see if you have an underlying condition, such as depression, restless legs syndrome or sleep apnea, that requires medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ECBCALLKPVC3DG2T3GVIUTSO5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But for occasional periods of insomnia that leave you feeling bleary-eyed, experts say there may be some dietary supplements and even foods that can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B5H2YL6AQJGJ3HHOWWUSBEIT6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s important to recognize that no dietary supplement is going to radically improve your sleep. Supplements shouldn’t be viewed as a long-term solution. And almost all supplements carry the risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DCWYBCFTBZC5HNXRKLP6FP6C7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To find out more about what works and what doesn’t, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/08/07/supplements-sleep-melatonin-magnesium/" target="_blank"&gt;read our story here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="NIGXMVGY4VFZXOISDQW2PDKWCM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="NIGXMVGY4VFZXOISDQW2PDKWCM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why we procrastinate doing things we enjoy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U2J4ONP3RFBM7KQRZXUXEBTANM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Usually, when we think about procrastination, we think about delaying the hard, boring or unpleasant things in life — paying bills, doing laundry or meeting work deadlines. The bulk of scientific research focuses on why we delay pain, not pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YBQIMZ5S7VD2XFC2EJO67XRHMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But we can also put off things we enjoy — catching up with a friend we haven’t seen in a while, visiting a nearby attraction or opening that expensive bottle of wine, says brain science reporter Richard Sima.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ACNNMJ6OA5FSHJ7YQJVNZLRFJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A recent study published in the journal PNAS Nexus explored this hidden side of procrastination.

So when the US health department announced plans to cut half a billion dollars in vaccine research funding on Wednesday, the world took notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US is the &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/foundation-for-u-s-breakthroughs-feels-shakier-to-researchers/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;world’s largest funder of biomedical research&lt;/a&gt;, but this position has become more precarious with the appointment of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime vaccine sceptic, as US health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"world","tags":[{"id":"world/series/first-edition","type":"Series","title":"First Edition newsletter"},{"id":"world/series/guardian-morning-briefing","type":"Series","title":"Guardian morning briefing"},{"id":"campaign/email/morning-briefing","type":"Campaign","title":"First Edition (newsletter signup)"},{"id":"us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr","type":"Keyword","title":"Robert F Kennedy Jr"},{"id":"us-news/donaldtrump","type":"Keyword","title":"Donald Trump"},{"id":"society/vaccines","type":"Keyword","title":"Vaccines and immunisation"},{"id":"world/coronavirus-outbreak","type":"Keyword","title":"Coronavirus"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"us-news/us-politics","type":"Keyword","title":"US politics"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/newsletter-tone","type":"Tone","title":"Newsletters"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/aamna-mohdin","type":"Contributor","title":"Aamna Mohdin","twitterHandle":"aamnamohdin","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/01/15/Aamna-Mohdin.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=822026ccf36ea70e6b5e9b382073ed00","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/01/15/Aamna_Mohdin,_L.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=4ae99a84606629d4b99f943d0905827e"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/newsletters","type":"Tracking","title":"Newsletters"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"world/2025/aug/08/friday-briefing-what-will-us-funding-cuts-on-mrna-vaccines-mean-for-the-health-of-the-world","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This week, Kennedy has announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/rfk-jr-hhs-mrna-vaccine-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;terminate 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, casting doubt on the safety of a technology widely credited with helping end the Covid-19 pandemic and saving millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In total the affected projects are worth nearly $500m (£376m), according to the health agency. As for Kennedy, he said: “We reviewed the science, listened to the experts, and acted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The only problem? The scientific community in the US and around the world has overwhelmingly condemned the decision. To understand why, for today’s newsletter I spoke to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Head&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a global health researcher at the University of Southampton. That’s after the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="five-big-stories" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Five big stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Israel-Gaza war &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/08/israel-cabinet-approves-netanyahu-gaza-city-takeover-plan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;his security cabinet had approved a plan to take over Gaza City&lt;/a&gt; after the prime minister earlier said Israel planned to take full control of the Palestinian territory. The decision early on Friday marks another escalation of Israel’s offensive in Gaza. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/aug/08/israel-gaza-city-take-over-netanyahu-plan-approved-live-updates-latest-news" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Follow developments live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ahead of an expected meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/08/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-rallies-europe-allies-before-trump-putin-meeting" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Europe must participate in the peace process&lt;/a&gt; between Ukraine and Russia. As the Kremlin refused a three-way meeting with Zelenskyy and Trump, the Ukrainian president said: “Ukraine is not afraid of meetings and expects the same brave approach from the Russian side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The chancellor and prime minister will begin to foreshadow tax rises and reforms from September to prepare the country for a difficult budget that could be held in November, the Guardian has been told. A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/07/reeves-starmer-pitch-roll-tax-rises-advance-difficult-budget" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rise in gambling levies – advocated by Gordon Brown &lt;/a&gt;– is thought to be near-guaranteed as part of the package of tax rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The latter generally introduce a weakened or inactivated part of a virus to train the immune system to recognise and fight it in the future; whereas mRNA vaccines use a molecule that tells our cells how to make a viral protein, which triggers the body’s immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This technology is a scientific gamechanger, to the extent the researchers behind it won the Nobel prize in 2023. But since rising to prominence during the Covid pandemic, mRNA vaccines have been dogged by misinformation (this analysis by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/06/despite-rfk-funding-block-mrna-vaccines-are-too-impressive-to-ignore" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;my colleague Nicola Davis&lt;/a&gt; is well worth a read.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Michael Head tells me that mRNA technology offers a very effective and adaptable approach to developing vaccines. “It’s often described as plug-and-play because you can adapt constituents of the vaccine with, for example, the latest Covid variant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For something like a flu vaccine, researchers need to incubate the virus and grow it, which takes weeks, Head explains. “That’s fine to an extent when it comes to producing an annual vaccine like we do for seasonal influenza, but the advantage to mRNA technology is that it can be updated so quickly that it allows us to produce new vaccines or update existing vaccines quicker, which can hopefully then reduce the threat of whatever infectious disease is present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is crucial during a pandemic such as Covid. “The mRNA vaccines saved about 20 million lives globally in the first year of their rollout,” Head says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is Kennedy doing this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy once described mRNA Covid vaccines as “the deadliest vaccine ever made”. On Wednesday, he justified the health agency’s decision to terminate research by claiming that data shows mRNA vaccines “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy offered no scientific evidence to support this – and Head said Kennedy has been spreading vaccine misinformation for years. “He has on at least one or two occasions compared vaccines to being like the Holocaust, a common anti-vaccine trope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He has also recently falsely claimed vaccines such as the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab contain “&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine-fetus-b2742886.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;aborted foetus debris&lt;/a&gt;”; ordered a sweeping new study on the long-debunked link between vaccines and autism; and dismissed a panel of government vaccine experts, replacing them with his own appointees – who then voted to ban a longstanding vaccine preservative that has been a frequent target of the anti-vaccine movement despite its strong safety record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy claims he is shutting down research on mRNA vaccines and instead shifting funding to “safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate”, and that mRNA vaccines “encourage new mutations and can actually prolong pandemics”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s just not true, though. Head says variants actually tend to emerge in the absence of vaccinations, and in people with long-term infections – often those who are immunocompromised and can’t get over the virus quickly. That gives the virus more chances to multiply and mutate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Vaccines reduce the risk of transmission and infection,” Head says, which means fewer opportunities for the virus to mutate. “So vaccines will have a protective effect against new variants emerging, rather than as Kennedy suggests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact will this have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The question of the next pandemic is not if, but when. History shows pandemics happen, Head says, pointing to the 1918 flu pandemic, swine flu, Sars, and of course Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Head says this is especially true in our era of globalisation and human encroachment into new environments. “If you create enough opportunities, a new virus will enter human beings. There might be a scenario where it runs out of control like we saw with Covid. Or, it might be a bit more like Sars, where we were able to get it under control within a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“But again, globalisation and the mixing of people and animals makes things more challenging. And so a pandemic will happen at some point. We just don’t know when.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Technologies like mRNA vaccines, then, are vital. Head added that the potential applications go far beyond infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There’s quite promising research on skin cancer and the potential for this technology to be applied across different areas of health,” Head says. That is another reason Kennedy’s decision is so damaging, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of Head’s research areas focuses on how funding decisions impact science such as cancer research. “It’s very early days, but we are starting to see a slightly alarming picture. It’ll be very hard for the rest of the world to fill the cancer research gaps that the US is likely to leave.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a worrying time for the scientific community?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is no way to sugarcoat it; this is a particularly alarming moment for scientists. The World Health Organization coined the term “infodemic&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt; during the pandemic to describe the overwhelming amount of misinformation that spreads during a public health crisis, Head says. Even before Covid, in 2019 the WHO listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;top 10 global health threats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I have huge concerns that if a pandemic happened again tomorrow, whether populations in the UK, US, and around the world would trust public health decision making that would be vital to mitigate the impacts of any new pandemic. So the role of misinformation is significant and it can be very severe,” Head warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It does not help that some of the most powerful people, like US president Donald Trump and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, are making poor quality comments on vaccination because that does have an impact on population level decision making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some of Head’s research has looked into &lt;a href="https://www.panafrican-med-journal.com/content/article/43/165/full/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccine uptake in Ghana&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. The study found that political views played a big role in whether someone agreed to receive a Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“​​The government was saying, go and get vaccinated, please, but there was a fair amount of anti-government sentiment at the time. And hesitancy was greater if you voted for the opposition and therefore trusted the government messaging less. So there are lessons to be learned on who delivers the messaging to get your vaccine, and how to address that lack of trust in governance,” Head said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For now, the world holds its breath … and hopes no one sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-38" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

 Neonatal nurse Lucy Letby became, in tabloid parlance, “Britain’s worst child serial killer” when she was convicted in 2023 of seven murders and seven attempted murders of infants in her care. This brilliantly cogent documentary, which forces sentiment aside and unpacks the science and statistics around the most contested pieces of evidence, covers more ground more meticulously in an hour than any documentary I’ve seen in recent years, and perhaps ever. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Mangan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Film&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kingdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; | ★★★★☆&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Lesia, a moody 15-year-old, is sent to her mob boss father’s luxurious and fortified family compound , and she is thrilled when she quickly becomes lieutenant. There are fierce and overwhelmingly authentic performances from first-time actors in Julien Colonna’s intensely atmospheric, absorbing and exciting drama. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Bradshaw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Flies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; | ★★★★☆&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 This perception-warping bug puzzler reimagines the inevitably short lifespan of a housefly as an absurd tragedy – by providing the soon-to-perish pest with a bucket list. Over the course of roughly a minute, players buzz around minimalist 2D environments trying to make those last wishes come true. By blending this thinky thesis with playful mechanics, it supplies a lighthearted canvas for players to engage with existentialism for an hour or two. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Thwaites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="today-in-focus" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Today in Focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="bbd8d0d6-447f-45d3-91c5-a16769da61ec" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A textile worker in Datang subdistrict, Guangzhou, Guangdong province, China.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Go Nakamura/Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside China’s fast-fashion factories as a US trade war looms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian’s senior China correspondent, Amy Hawkins, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/aug/08/inside-chinas-fast-fashion-factories-as-a-us-trade-war-looms-podcast" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;visits factories threatened by US tariffs&lt;/a&gt; in Guangzhou, south China, as the deadline for a US-China trade agreement approaches with no deal yet in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cartoon-of-the-day-martin-rowson" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Cartoon of the day | Martin Rowson&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="f44eef35-8375-4f61-abb0-2665b124c517" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: Martin Rowson/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-upside" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;The Upside&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="57c52a6a-bc32-471f-99d8-737a031f94db" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Experts say the return of the lynx would bring many advantages, including hunting overly large populations of deer.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lynx – shy wild cats no bigger than a Labrador – became extinct in Britain 1,300 years ago thanks to hunting and habitat loss.

The paper found that releasing 20 lynx over several years would eventually create a healthy population of about 50 animals, bringing benefits like helping to curb the overpopulation of deer in woodlands. According to the researchers, Kielder Forest is the only area of England and Wales with enough woodland for lynx to thrive. But thankfully locals are keen on the plan, with 72% of people in the project area supporting reintroduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/12/the-upside-sign-up-for-our-weekly-email" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Sign up here&lt;/a&gt; for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bored-at-work" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Bored at work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.

Researchers have found that lithium levels in the brain are closely linked to the condition, and that lithium supplements can reverse Alzheimer's-like memory loss in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from Harvard Medical School, the researchers wanted to investigate &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200282"&gt;previous links&lt;/a&gt; that have been made between exposure to metals and dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through hundreds of donated brain tissue and blood samples taken from people with advanced Alzheimer's, early-stage &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI), and no cognitive issues at all, the team ran tests for dozens of different metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-distinct-patterns-may-signal-alzheimers-according-to-science"&gt;These 4 Distinct Patterns May Signal Alzheimer's According to Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one metal showed significant differences in abundance between these groups: lithium. Reduced levels of this metal were also noticeable at the earliest stages of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-name-new-type-of-memory-loss-often-mistaken-for-alzheimers"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt; in the tested samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer's disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/could-lithium-explain-and-treat-alzheimers/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist and neurologist Bruce Yankner, from Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lithium is widely used to treat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, this is the first time it's been found to be naturally present in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lithium turns out to be like other nutrients we get from the environment, such as iron and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="170622" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; C," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/could-lithium-explain-and-treat-alzheimers/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Yankner. "It's the first time anyone's shown that lithium exists at a natural level that's biologically meaningful without giving it as a drug."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170625" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/LithiumDeficiency.jpg" alt="Lithium deficiency images" class="wp-image-170625 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/LithiumDeficiency.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/LithiumDeficiency-600x307.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170625" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, lithium deficiency (the two right panels) dramatically increased amyloid beta (top) and tau (bottom) proteins, compared to mice with normal lithium levels (left two panels). (Yankner Lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed that the amyloid-beta protein clumps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/3d-molecular-structure-of-alzheimers-brains-revealed-for-the-first-time"&gt;that accompany Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be binding to lithium in the brain, making less of it available to neurons and further accelerating the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers ran tests on mice, finding that depriving their brains of lithium dramatically increased the clumps of amyloid-beta in their brains. The amount of another Alzheimer's-related protein &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sky-high-levels-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-newborns"&gt;called tau&lt;/a&gt; also increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, the researchers found that a certain type of lithium, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_orotate"&gt;lithium orotate&lt;/a&gt;, could evade capture by amyloid-beta proteins. When small doses of it were given to mice with Alzheimer's-like symptoms, the animals' memory function was restored, and other signs of cognitive decline were effectively reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still plenty of questions left unanswered, as is often the case with Alzheimer's, which is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-disease-harms-the-brain-in-2-distinct-phases-study-reveals"&gt;an incredibly complex disease&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment, it's not clear how levels of lithium begin to drop, for example, and how that then leads to signs of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies should help to clarify that, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="170622" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are the next significant step. Eventually, Alzheimer's could be diagnosed earlier by measuring patients' lithium levels, while lithium supplements could be a useful preventative or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the number of people with dementia &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-can-strike-as-young-as-30-these-are-the-signs-to-watch-for"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, there's an urgent need to find ways of protecting the brain against the devastating consequences of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human &lt;span&gt;clinical trial&lt;/span&gt;, but so far the results are very encouraging," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/could-lithium-explain-and-treat-alzheimers/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Yankner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09335-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In a statistically sophisticated analysis of health records, the team found that the vaccine reduced the probability of getting dementia by one-fifth over a seven-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that people who received the shingles vaccine were less likely to develop clinical dementia over the seven-year follow-up period, and women benefited more than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study design allowed researchers to compare two groups without actively depriving any one group of access to vaccination. The two groups were also of comparable age and had similar medical comorbidities – meaning similar rates of other medical conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results from this and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-221231"&gt;other related studies&lt;/a&gt; raise the possibility that vaccines may have a broader role in experimental therapeutics outside the realm of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies also raise provocative questions about how vaccines work and how our immune system can potentially prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How vaccines might be protective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One scientific explanation for the reduction of dementia by the herpes zoster vaccine could be the direct protection against the shingles virus, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-230718"&gt;may play a role in exacerbating dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is also the possibility that the vaccine may have conferred protection by activating the immune system and providing "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6"&gt;trained immunity&lt;/a&gt;," in which the immune system is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20221388"&gt;strengthened by repeated exposure&lt;/a&gt; to vaccines or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not differentiate between different types of dementia, such as dementia due to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease or dementia due to stroke. Additionally, researchers cannot draw any definitive conclusions about possible mechanisms for how the vaccines could be protective from an analysis of health records alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step would be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study – the "gold standard" for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in medicine – to directly examine how the herpes zoster vaccine compares with a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; in their ability to reduce the risk of dementia over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such studies are necessary before any vaccines, as well as other potential therapies, can be recommended for routine clinical use in the prevention of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The challenges of untangling dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a major noncommunicable disease that is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-024-01051-w"&gt;a leading cause of death around the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A January 2025 study provided &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03340-9"&gt;updated figures on lifetime dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; across different subsets of the US population. The researchers estimate that the lifetime risk of dementia after age 55 is 42% – more than double earlier estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dementia risk was 4% by age 75, and 20% by age 85, with the majority of risk occurring after 85. The researchers projected that the number of new cases of dementia in the US would double over the next four decades from approximately 514,000 cases in 2020 to 1 million in 2060.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170679" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170679" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642.jpg" alt="elderly man looking at a book with a partner" class="wp-image-170679 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170679" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cases of dementia could reach 1 million by 2060. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD5TsR1koQ/"&gt;Robert Kneschke/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once considered a disease largely confined to the developed world, the deleterious effects of dementia are now apparent throughout the globe, as life expectancy increases in many formerly developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are different forms of dementia with varying clinical manifestations and underlying neurobiology, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prospective studies that specifically test how giving a vaccine changes the risk for future dementia may benefit from studying patient populations with specific types of dementia because each version of dementia might require distinct treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for the past two to three decades, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1566067"&gt;amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; – which posits that accumulation of a protein called amyloid in the brain contributes to the disorder – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2023.102161"&gt;dominated the scientific conversation&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, most of the efforts in the experimental therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease have focused on drugs that lower the levels of amyloid in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, results to date have been &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02480-1/fulltext"&gt;modest and disappointing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(23)00274-0/fulltext"&gt;two recently approved amyloid-lowering therapies&lt;/a&gt; have only a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.19080873"&gt;minimal impact on slowing the decline&lt;/a&gt;, are expensive and have potentially serious side effects. And no drug currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical use reverses the cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies based on health records suggest that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2022.12.029"&gt;past exposure to viruses increase the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, while routine vaccines, including those against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, shingles and others, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-221231"&gt;reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Innovation and an open mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is sometimes a tendency among scientists to cling to older, familiar models of disease and a reluctance to move in more unconventional directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the process of doing science has a way of teaching researchers like us humility, opening our minds to new information, learning from our mistakes and going where that data takes us in our quest for effective, life-saving therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines may be one of those paths less traveled. It is an exciting possibility that may open the door to other breakthroughs in understanding and treating degenerative disorders of the brain.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257807/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Compared to monthlies, daily lenses “have a pretty big advantage,” says Dr. William McLaughlin, an optometrist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “They’re more comfortable, more convenient, and you’ll have better eye health if you’re using a fresh lens every day. They're absolutely the way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at why daily lenses beat out monthlies—plus how to put the higher price tag into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They counteract bad habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily lenses are an “easy yes” for people whose contact hygiene could use a tune-up, says Dr. Neal Guymon, an optometrist in Idaho known as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/dreyeguy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. EyeGuy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. EyeGuy&lt;/a&gt; online. That includes those who sleep in their lenses (which deprives oxygen from the eyes, just like “sleeping with a paper bag over your head,” he says), don’t clean their cases regularly, slack on subbing in new contact solution, and forget to switch into a new pair every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact overuse—wearing lenses for more days than you should—can lead to inflammation on the eyeballs or eyelids, including giant papillary conjunctivitis, which is essentially an allergic reaction to wearing contacts for too long. “It can be super irritating and hard to get rid of,” Guymon says. Sometimes, overuse can cause lenses to be “clogged up with debris, so they lose the ability to transfer oxygen through the contact,” he adds, which leads to corneal neovascularization, or blood vessels that burrow into the cornea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7303678/dry-eyes-causes-treatments/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Battling Dry Eyes? Here’s What Actually Helps;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battling Dry Eyes? Here’s What Actually Helps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How you take care of your monthly lenses when they're not in your eyes matters, too. Contact cases harbor bacteria and biofilm (the sticky, slimy film that accumulates on your eyelids), so you should wash them every day, after you pop your lenses in. It’s also a good idea to replace the case once a month, Guymon says, perhaps getting into the habit of doing so when you switch into a new pair of lenses. You should also replace the disinfectant solution in your case every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people come into my practice because they have an eye infection or an eye problem that's related to contact lenses, 99 times out of 100, it's someone who’s either been sleeping in contacts or wearing the same lenses for three months,” Guymon says. “Dailies are better, but they're not necessarily better because they're the better contact (which they are). It’s more because people treat them the way they should be treated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They have superior construction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When daily lenses were introduced in the 1990s, ophthalmologists worried that people would wear them for more than just one day—that they’d buy a 90-pack and then never see their eye doctor again, stretching the lenses out far longer than they should. But those concerns didn’t come to fruition. Daily lenses are so comfortable that people tend to quickly adapt to their new routine: Wake up, pop in a fresh set, go about the day, and then take them out and toss them in the trash, no solution or contact case required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a mindset,” says Dr. Christine Sindt, a clinical professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences at the University of Iowa’s Carver College of Medicine. “If you try to wear a daily disposable the second day, you will physically go, ‘Oh, I don't feel as good.’ People notice it, because it feels so good that first day. It turns out that when people wear dailies, it becomes who they are—it’s their pattern of behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://time.com/7307026/when-to-go-emergency-room-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 Symptoms ER Doctors Say to Never Ignore;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 Symptoms ER Doctors Say to Never Ignore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In part, that’s because daily lenses are constructed differently than monthlies. They’re thinner, which means they’re less likely to create small corneal abrasions, or scratches on the surface of the eye. Plus, they’re made out of different plastics and have different surface coatings that allow them to be more biocompatible, which means they don’t harm any living tissue. (Monthlies, on the other hand, can, especially if you wear them for longer than their intended lifespan.) Some dailies, for example, are coated with phospholipid, which is what cell membranes are made of. “For patients who have dry eyes, I’ll put this lens on them, and it’ll feel like a cozy blanket on the surface of their eye,” Sindt says. “These lenses aren’t only more comfortable [than monthlies]—in many cases, they're more comfortable than the bare eye.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They prevent grimy buildup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you wear the same contacts every day, they attract all kinds of proteins, lipids, and enzymes that are found in the tear film that keeps your eyes lubricated. “When you have a foreign body in the eye, every time you blink, the body's mechanism is to try to protect itself,” which means it will secrete tears, says Dr. Shahzad Mian, a professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences at University of Michigan. “The more irritated the eyes are, the more proteins there are in your tear film—and those deposits then stick to the contact lens and cause even further irritation. It's a bad cycle some patients get stuck in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re wearing daily lenses, on the other hand, you’ll be tossing any buildup out at the end of the day—which means it won't have the chance to accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They protect against infection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sindt is a “huge fan of daily disposable contact lenses,” she says. “And the reason is, I’ve been doing this a very long time, and I’ve seen a lot of eye infections. Wearing contact lenses is not benign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people land in her exam room, they’ve often developed a painful bacterial, parasitic, or fungal eye infection stemming from poor contact hygiene or overuse. While some infections cause little more than irritation, others could lead to vision loss or require a corneal transplant. “I see the patients who have had adverse events,” Sindt says. “I hear the stories, and it’s an everyday thing. It’s kind of like playing Russian Roulette, people who don't take care of their contact lenses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can generally get away with poor contact hygiene for a while, especially when you’re young. Youth is an “amazing protectant," Sindt says—young people have thicker tear films, as well as eyes that are less likely to become inflamed. But that doesn’t last forever. “If somebody goes along with their bad habits, at some point, they're going to get older, and they're going to end up with an infection,” she says. “It catches up to everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://time.com/7301010/red-eyes-itchy-allergy-conjunctivitis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What to Do About Your Red, Itchy Eyes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What to Do About Your Red, Itchy Eyes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why even though &lt;a href="https://www.optometrists.org/general-practice-optometry/optical/guide-to-contact-lenses/what-are-contact-lenses/daily-v-monthly-costs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dailies generally cost more than monthlies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dailies generally cost more than monthlies&lt;/a&gt;, eye experts say they’re worth it.

			&lt;p&gt;Those 'crow's feet' at the corners of your eyes really do deserve to be called laughter lines, according to a recent study by researchers from Binghamton University in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using skin samples from people aged 16 to 91, the team confirmed the repeated &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-flexible-prosthetic-skin-can-sense-pressure-temperature-and-moisture"&gt;stretching and releasing of skin&lt;/a&gt; in one direction strains the aged tissue in a way that leads to wrinkles in a similar fashion to the wearing of creases into your favorite pair of denim jeans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is no longer just a theory," &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5684/your-skin-buckles-as-you-age-and-thats-why-wrinkles-form"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical engineer Guy German. "We now have hard experimental evidence showing the physical mechanism behind aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sleep-wrinkles-are-a-real-thing-and-its-all-about-how-you-sleep"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Wrinkles Are a Real Thing, And It's All About How You Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.104.034406"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have explored the mechanics of dermal stress and degradation, this investigation is the first to physically test real skin samples with an instrument called a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_testing_machine"&gt;low-force tensometer&lt;/a&gt; and observe the resulting changes under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stress applied by the tensometer was intended to mimic the wear and tear of everyday life. The researchers found that the skin contraction movements made in response to the stretches &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-humans-age-faster-at-2-sharp-peaks-heres-when-they-hit"&gt;got bigger with age&lt;/a&gt;, causing buckling and wrinkling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our skin is also in a semi-stretched state by default, the researchers found, and those forces also change as we get towards later life. The outer layer (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_corneum"&gt;stratum corneum&lt;/a&gt;) gradually gets stiffer, while the underlying layer gets softer as the density of its collagen scaffolding decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170098" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170098" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SkinWrinkles.jpg" alt="Skin wrinkle diagram" class="wp-image-170098 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SkinWrinkles.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SkinWrinkles-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SkinWrinkles-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170098" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers carefully monitored how skin tissue responded to stretching. (Ittycheri et al., &lt;em&gt;J. Mech. Behav. Biomed. Mater.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, skin loses volume by pushing out fluid, the team's experiments showed, exacerbating the effects of wrinkles. This &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poroelasticity"&gt;poroelastic quality&lt;/a&gt; of the skin is significant, and hasn't been recorded before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you stretch Silly Putty, for instance, it stretches horizontally, but it also shrinks in the other direction – it gets thinner," &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5684/your-skin-buckles-as-you-age-and-thats-why-wrinkles-form"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; German. "That's what skin does as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As you get older, that contraction gets bigger. And if your skin is contracted too much, it buckles. That's how wrinkles form."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is about more than just knowing where wrinkles come from. By understanding the characteristics of our skin, and how they change over time, we can better understand (and treat) a variety of different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-skin-is-a-billboard-for-hidden-illnesses-heres-how-to-read-it"&gt;skin diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just the outer skin that the researchers are interested in, either: they suggest that their work could have implications for modeling other tissues. These techniques could be applied to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-wrinkles-are-way-more-important-than-we-ever-realized"&gt;wrinkles in the brain&lt;/a&gt; as well, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings here could also be important when it comes to caring for the skin – and assessing just how effective various anti-aging skin products actually are (especially as there are so many of them &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-retinol-reverse-signs-of-aging-heres-the-science"&gt;vying for our attention&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers make the link between the effects of chronological aging on the skin, and the damaging effects of exposure to the Sun's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weve-been-wrong-about-what-causes-sunburn-scientists-discover"&gt;ultraviolet radiation&lt;/a&gt; – something that sunscreen can help prevent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you spend your life working outside, you're more likely to have more aged and wrinkled skin than those who are office workers, for example," &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5684/your-skin-buckles-as-you-age-and-thats-why-wrinkles-form"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; German.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2025.107080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is a high risk of developing microbial keratitis, otherwise known as a corneal ulcer, that can lead to permanent blindness and in some cases corneal transplant,” she noted. “Instead, always rinse and store in contact lens solution, replace your case regularly, and replace lenses as directed by your eye care provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to storing and lubricating your contact lenses improperly, using the same pair for longer than recommended can lead to eye health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I never forget to discard my contact lenses in the prescribed time period,” McLaughlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t eat an unbalanced diet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating a diet high in sugar and fat may go without saying as being bad for one’s health, but it also has a disproportionately negative effect on the eyes,” Deobhakta said. “Certain diseases like diabetes are responsible for the most common forms of irreversible blindness that we see in our clinics, and that is often linked to eating an unbalanced diet high in carbohydrates and fat.” &lt;/p&gt;

After a Legionnaires' outbreak that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5652421/#:~:text=During%20the%20summer%20of%202015,tower%20in%20the%20South%20Bronx." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sickened 138 people and killed 16&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago, &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/ll77of2015.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;city law&lt;/a&gt; requires building owners to test for Legionella bacteria every three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d223h"&gt;In 2017, the first year of inspections, the agency inspected 5,200 cooling towers and issued over 48,000 violations to building owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dt9t6"&gt;This year, the department is on track to complete less than half that number of inspections – just 1,167 as of June, according to data provided by the health department. It’s a record low, not counting 2020 and 2021, when the pandemic disrupted city services. And the number of violations this year is set to hit an all-time low. As of April, the department only issued 269.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5v2q3"&gt;The data also shows year after year of declining enforcement. After rebounding to 4,400 inspections in 2022, the agency has conducted between 22% and 30% fewer inspections and issued fewer violations each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dhuqh"&gt;Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the decrease in inspections was due to a lack of inspectors at the agency. She did not respond to questions about the severity of the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a7q6o"&gt;The current outbreak that started in late July has sickened 73 people, three of them fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="50ov4"&gt;The 2017 laws require building owners to register cooling towers and inspect for Legionella bacteria. The law, however, does not indicate how often the city must carry out its own inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6agon"&gt;Cooling tower inspections, according to city experts, are a critical defense against outbreaks of the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8qu05"&gt;Acting Health Commissioner Michelle Morse told WNYC on Wednesday that the ability to inspect cooling towers after the outbreak helped the city stop the disease's spread in Harlem. However, she did not elaborate on whether more regular inspections could have prevented the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d6ai0"&gt;“From my perspective, there is of course always more that we can do to advance our prevention efforts, and this is why investing in public health is so important,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6iafe"&gt;A review of cooling tower registration and inspection data shows that about 1,900 of the 4,928 registered towers in the city have not been inspected by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene since 2023 and 85 have no record of inspection by the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cjkk2"&gt;Those towers cool apartments and other large buildings by circulating water through air conditioning systems. The water returns to the cooling tower warm and is evaporated as vapor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="55aas"&gt;Without proper inspection and treatment, that warm water can become a hotbed for deadly Legionella bacteria. Inhaling infected vapor can lead to Legionnaires’ disease, which causes cough, fever, chills, muscle aches and difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 22:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNOXZZU2taekFwaEtuQkZCZ2d1SDZJWHFoLXdFNFI4eHA2am9kOHlBbVRtQXZkWFdWbkhIOWVmODd4cTNZNU4xVHJUcE5TWHVoTVYtYUlRRmZ3akxEdjJ5RFJicjFURzVpNFZkMmNnb29tTEhOMUttaXc5RnlpVkFKb1lJcVlyclZqQkdETzRpVmJRaUxZckFnaXRFR1EzUQ</guid></item><item><title>密西西比州的性病率飙升，这是一种流行病！ - TMZ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE5HMXRWTUVOcXZNdVp5T0l1WjYwcENqOXR0SkxMU2tSRExwVmd6QkU0dkVoMWFMV1FRQUQ4b1B1NWhRRW55VWZ3ZGlOTElxUTN5VU9OTGFEeDVYUmVWM0xzLVdvRzRDbWRKTXFrUnEydTdSWURPajR30gF3QVVfeXFMTnF5ckJWM1A1RkJGSml2elhLSXJsaFVsWjYxNUsyZ09mV1hpRm1HZDBkU2hLUmJDczVkSEZUNTFSWEFGMjYtazlSWlhZV0F1ZFpRNXZUcVAxUzJLWGVzRzFwX1JlSDBIUVJYYkhoaWlwajlmakpPaFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;header class="article__header"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Mississippi’s going through a bumpy time lately, and it’s not because of the heat -- turns out, the state is facing a major STD outbreak!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The Southern state, already struggling with sky-high rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV, has just dropped a jaw-dropping stat -- roughly 1,200 cases per 100,000 people. To put that into perspective, that’s at least one person in a room of 100 Mississippians walking around with a sexually transmitted disease or infection. Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;According to the 2023 report -- with the latest available national CDC figures -- Mississippi’s not just playing in the game, they’re at the top of the leaderboard. The state ranked 3rd for primary and secondary syphilis, 5th for gonorrhea, and a staggering 2nd for chlamydia. Talk about a dirty sweep!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Syphilis, like other STDs, spreads through bacteria when infected fluids make contact -- usually during sex or any of its various acts. It can also be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy, leading to severe health issues if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Health professionals are now sounding the alarm, urging Mississippians to take action -- get tested, stay vigilant, and fight back against syphilis before it claims even more ground. The clock’s ticking, people!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A greasy takeaway may seem like an innocent Friday night indulgence. But our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S3050624725000051"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; suggests even a single high-fat meal could impair blood flow to the brain, potentially increasing the risk of stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dietary fat is an important part of our diet. It provides us with a concentrated source of energy, transports vitamins and when stored in the body, protects our organs and helps keep us warm. The two main types of fat that we consume are saturated and unsaturated (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated), which are differentiated by their chemical composition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But these fats have different effects on our body. For example, it is well established that eating a meal that is high in saturated fat, such as that self-indulgent Friday night takeaway pizza, can be bad for our blood vessels and heart health. And these effects are not simply confined to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The brain has limited energy stores, which means it is heavily reliant on a continuous supply of blood delivering oxygen and glucose to maintain normal function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the ways the body maintains this supply is through a process known as &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0271678X241235878"&gt;“dynamic cerebral autoregulation”&lt;/a&gt;. This process ensures that blood flow to the brain remains stable despite everyday changes in blood pressure, such as standing up and exercising. It’s like having shock absorbers that help keep our brains cool under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when this process is impaired, those swings in blood pressure become harder to manage. That can mean brief episodes of too little or too much blood reaching the brain. Over time, this increases the risk of developing conditions like stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-role-might-diet-play"&gt;What role might diet play?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After eating a meal high in saturated fat, levels of fat in the blood rise and peak after around four hours. At the same time, blood vessels become stiffer and lose their ability to relax and expand. This restricts blood flow around the body. But little is known about what happens to the brain during this time and how well its blood supply is protected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this for the first time, we recruited 20 young men between the ages of 18 and 35, and 21 men between 60 and 80. We measured how well blood vessels linked to heart and brain health worked before, and four hours following, consumption of a meal high in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We assessed how well a blood vessel in the arm could open up in response to increased blood flow to obtain an indication of heart health. This is a method known as &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00471.2010"&gt;“flow-mediated dilatation”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To evaluate how well blood vessels in the brain could cope with swings in blood pressure, our participants performed body-weight squats. We used ultrasound to determine how well blood flowed through vessels during both methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The test meal was a milkshake, which we called “the brain bomb” because it consisted mostly of heavy whipping cream. The drink contained 1,362 calories and 130g of fat, mimicking the fat load of a fast-food takeaway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our findings confirmed previous research that has shown that a high-fat meal impairs the ability of the blood vessels linked to heart health to open in both young and old participants. These impairments reduced the brain’s ability to buffer changes in blood pressure. This was more pronounced (by about 10%) in the older adults, suggesting that older brains may be more vulnerable to the effects of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although we didn’t directly test for the long-term effects of a high-fat meal on mental functioning in this study, &lt;a href="https://portlandpress.com/clinsci/article-abstract/131/23/2807/71652/Post-prandial-hyperlipidaemia-results-in-systemic?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;we have previously shown&lt;/a&gt; that such a meal increases free radicals (unstable, cell-damaging molecules) and decreases nitric oxide (molecules that help blood vessels relax and open up to transport oxygen and glucose around the body).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This may explain the reduced blood flow regulation we observed in our recent study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has important clinical implications. While an occasional takeaway is unlikely to cause harm on its own, our results suggest that even one fatty meal has an immediate effect on the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our study highlights the importance of consuming a diet that is low in saturated fat to protect not only our heart health, but also our brain health. This is particularly important for older adults whose brains appear to be more vulnerable to the effects of such a meal and are already at increased risk of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;NHS recommendeds&lt;/a&gt; that men consume no more than 30g of saturated fat a day, while women should consume no more than 20g. Yet many of us routinely exceed that, particularly during weekend takeaways, pub lunches or fast-food splurges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, we may spend much of our waking lives in a post-meal state. This period, known as &lt;a href="https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-017-0568-5"&gt;“post-prandial lipaemia”&lt;/a&gt;, is when fat levels are elevated, and when the body, it seems, may be most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-food-for-thought"&gt;Food for thought&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s still so much more we need to learn about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; recommends swapping saturated fats for polyunsaturated ones. These are found in foods like oily fish, walnuts and seeds, which are associated with better heart and brain health over the long term. But we don’t yet know how the brain responds to a single meal that is high in polyunsaturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nor do we know how the female brain responds to a high-fat meal. This is a crucial gap in our knowledge since women face a greater risk of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000950"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00249-8/fulltext"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; in later life compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our study offers a timely reminder that diet doesn’t just shape our long-term health. It also affects our body and brain in real time. And as we’re learning, when it comes to protecting brain health, every meal may count.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;/header&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A 1-month-old infant on Martha’s Vineyard contracted a rare but serious tick-borne disease, her family and local health officials said, as &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/07/09/northeast-sees-worst-summer-surge-in-tick-bites-in-years-cdc-says/"&gt;tick-borne diseases&lt;/a&gt; are on the rise across the state this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powassan virus was detected in a resident of &lt;a href="http://Boston.com/tag/marthas-vineyard"&gt;Martha’s Vineyard&lt;/a&gt;, local public health officials said Monday. The virus is transmitted by deer ticks within 15 minutes of a bite, and there is no specific treatment, vaccine, or cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local public health announcement comes during one of the &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/07/09/northeast-sees-worst-summer-surge-in-tick-bites-in-years-cdc-says/"&gt;largest surges&lt;/a&gt; in tick bites in the last five years. In Massachusetts, most of the tick exposure was concentrated in the Berkshires and on Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/lists/monthly-tick-borne-disease-reports#2025-"&gt;the state’s May 2025 report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rare, the rate of Powassan virus is increasing, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/about/index.html"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, and can cause severe disease, including inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, as well as brain swelling, confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 and 2 percent of nymph deer tickets on Martha’s Vineyard are infected, said Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor who researches on the island. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare,” Telford said in a &lt;a href="https://www.capecod.gov/2025/08/05/press-release-rare-but-serious-tick-borne-virus-investigated-on-marthas-vineyard/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a similar rate to that seen elsewhere in New England. This suggests that many people who are exposed may successfully fight off the virus without ever knowing they were infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-month-old Lily, born on June 30, was on a walk with her mom and her older sister on a West Tisbury bike path near her home, her family told the &lt;a href="https://vineyardgazette.com/news/2025/08/05/west-tisbury-infant-contracts-powassan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vineyard Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The infant was first taken to the hospital with a high fever, and doctors eventually determined the source was the tick bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suffered brain damage, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-lily-siscos-health-journey?lang=en_US&amp;amp;utm_campaign=man_ss_icons&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link&amp;amp;attribution_id=sl%3Aed5b139f-5cd0-4ba3-8249-d52adf974399&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawL_K8pleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFXWGJTOXp2M2FTZGdIYnBXAR7a61BX1DlBiy46pvum9XsqoVWf_JDlIUd_J-q-xDYIQgrR3u5M1VozBphn_g_aem_zxBXvhKa8vqN8tK30hctcQ"&gt;GoFundMe created for the family&lt;/a&gt;, due to meningitis and encephalitis from the Powassan, which was unknown at the time, an update last week said. The baby was receiving care at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Please, please check yourselves, your children and your pets,” Tiffany Sisco said, according to the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. “It was the tiniest nymph tick the size of a needle tip. No rash or bullseye was detected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisco was sharing updates on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/tiffany.lynn.9003/posts/pfbid02DVzwZi1GMzS2pVsTprpTozSGWeZzCzgNTsbMfg6bCALdKFmYw46SM1VSmCmujZyTl"&gt;her Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, where she said Thursday morning that Lily was stable “and awaiting further tests” in her final public update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(We) hope to bring her home soon,” Sisco wrote. “Continued prayers as we navigate our new normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

Youths ranging from age one to 18 reported that nearly 62 percent of their diet was highly processed. That number dipped to 53 percent among adults over age 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are common and can take a variety of forms, from pre-packaged snacks, frozen foods and bottled soda drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Thursday’s findings are likely to add fuel to a campaign under Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="/news/2025/2/13/us-senate-confirms-robert-f-kennedy-as-health-and-human-services-leader"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; to reform the US diet, as part of his “Make America Healthy Again” campaign (MAHA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one day before the latest CDC numbers were published, Kennedy used his social media account to once again blame high-calorie, processed foods for a variety of ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genes don’t cause epidemics. They may provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin — and we know what it is. It’s sugar and ultra-processed foods,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1953096453158588709" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on the platform X on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have repeatedly shown links between highly processed foods and detrimental health conditions like obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, however, &lt;a href="/news/2025/1/30/fact-check-rfk-jrs-statements-during-senate-confirmation-hearing"&gt;has been criticised&lt;/a&gt; for seeking “environmental toxins” to explain conditions like autism, which researchers largely believe to result from a variety of factors, including genetic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday’s survey results are part of a long-running study tracking what American adults and children eat and drink on a daily basis through interviews, body measurements and laboratory testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the study has its limitations: Interviews rely on self-reported food consumption, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its origins stretch back to the 1960s, and since 1999, the study has continued without interruption, according to the CDC. About &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;5,000 people&lt;/a&gt; take part each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest edition of the survey, researchers found that income played a significant role in how much ultra-processed foods were consumed per household. High-income groups corresponded with lower mean percentages of highly processed foods consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was particularly pronounced among adults. For those whose salaries were equivalent to 3.5 times the federal poverty level or more, a mean of 50.4 percent of their diet was comprised of processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That number rose to 54.7 percent for those whose incomes were slightly above, at or below the federal poverty level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey also identified the primary culinary culprits behind Americans’ consumption of highly processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandwiches, including burgers, were the highest source of ultra-processed foods, comprising 7.6 percent of the calories consumed by youth and 8.6 percent for adults. Sweet bakery foods were the next highest category, at 6.3 percent for minors and 5.2 percent for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweetened beverages and savoury snacks were also prominent sources of calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study did contain some positive news, showing that the mean consumption of ultra-processed foods had decreased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the survey period from 2013 to 2014, adults consumed a mean of 55.8 percent of their calories from highly processed items. But by the current period, that number slid to 53 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 21:22:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOMkh2OF9PaWRLZ3VCd2dPcDhyRXRXWlhnNXJMakRMNFZSdWVSbkFLbTJWOWZnM2QxeHlJOW1oY0JuaUZyb1U2bWFjdEUzSnBxYUZRS1JqU0JwM042WTlKZzJwc09xNzlYenhFcFRicmlqdWF0QlNNTTNhU19ERU01bFE3X3Z0d29reFl2bTlEV3RtMVZPZlFkcE9GN0V6NVBpM1RFTkdVR0VDUmd2Z1pOctIBtgFBVV95cUxOQk1ueDdMcUpEMW94dFN0WUxjdE9WckhRUmh5VDB2MFVJLS1LNUNvRWdiNjN6LTlnbmY4Q0lpZGFCYUcwcGpXMExRZlM2Y3A0WUhvTjB6RGgxWElUNE5mZjdJQ1lqV1FjdGZMZzl0QnpqdmJaNWJ2OTluNzNMQnF3dU5BNklHYkZrNkxVZzk2aWNmdFZjZjl0d05ySVBRLXc0QXQzQzZWeXdWaG1MQ0hDTENvMWVTdw</guid></item><item><title>随着病例的增加，第二例西尼罗河病毒死亡报告- KUSA.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxQVWNjeGhXU1FCcWpSSUdtSFlzZWU2TE1XQThrVE9NS3VtU2FNQUhIUjFYZlY1eFJWZ3FRc0xfVXI1SWV2ZFhqV2FEMVZSSW1qT2c5dEVLSkVyVVUxRjRPcUpHWHZ5UkdGcmsxX1FEVks5MWdaa1VpdjYzS1dCNnJDY2tEOUJCdW9ZWW5YbC11eDc4NF9oZ3BDRkZOcXVvUDBTVkRuMFBaazJQSzJKU2V5M3FBYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Instances of the disease are pretty rare overall, with pancreatic cancer only accounting for 3% of all cancers in the United States, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, it's more common in men than women. However, a 2023 study published in the journal &lt;em data-node-id="0.3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/study-confirms-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-faster-in-women-than-men/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/study-confirms-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-faster-in-women-than-men/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gastroenterology" data-node-id="0.3.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42860161/study-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-in-young-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42860161/study-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-in-young-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="rates of pancreatic cancer are rising faster in women" data-node-id="0.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;rates of pancreatic cancer are rising faster in women&lt;/a&gt;, especially in women of color, than they are in men. &lt;em data-node-id="0.7"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This fact, plus the aggressive nature of the illness, are why knowing the symptoms of pancreatic cancer is so important. “It has a high likelihood of spread, or metastasis, to other organs in the body,” said &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Neil Woody, M.D." data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Neil Woody, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic. What's more, the five-year survival rate is only 9%, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society" data-node-id="1.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Why is the disease on the rise? Part of it is due to increased detection, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Valerie Lee, M.D." data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Valerie Lee, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Sibley Memorial Hospital. Lifestyle factors may be playing a role as well. Increases in diabetes and obesity—two major risk factors for pancreatic cancer—may also be contributing to the rise in pancreatic cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="body-tip css-1707dxl emevuu60"&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Neil Woody, M.D." data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Neil Woody, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic; &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Valerie Lee, M.D." data-node-id="4.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Valerie Lee, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Sibley Memorial Hospital; &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kim Reiss, M.D." data-node-id="4.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Kim Reiss, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist specializing in pancreatic cancer at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-pancreatic-cancer-is-tough-to-diagnose" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Why pancreatic cancer is tough to diagnose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose. Only about 10% of pancreatic cancers have a genetic predisposition, and good screenings for the general population have been difficult to establish, said Dr. Woody. “Tests with high likelihood of detecting pancreatic cancer, such as endoscopic ultrasound, are invasive, costly, and may carry risks of complications that outweigh their use as screening tests for the average person,” he explained.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;What’s more, many of the symptoms of pancreatic cancer can be caused by other conditions. Plus, people have almost no symptoms at all until the cancer has spread to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, if you are experiencing any of these warning signs, it’s worth making an appointment with your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="9" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;1. You have no major risk factors for diabetes but suddenly have it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The pancreas produces insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. So if blood sugar levels suddenly chance, the pancreas becomes the number one suspect. “When people with no risk factors for &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="diabetes" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; (no family history, good diet, thin body type) develop new onset diabetes, or who have a history of well controlled diabetes suddenly find that it becomes difficult to control, it’s reasonable to evaluate why the pancreas may not be functioning as well,” said Dr. Lee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;2. You experience abdominal pain that feels like you're being squeezed around the middle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“The pancreas sits close to a bundle of blood vessels and nerves called the celiac plexus that can cause pain and nerve irritation,” said Dr. Lee. When it happens, the pain is usually pretty encompassing of your abdomen.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Patients feel pain from the epigastrum (the area just under the sternum) through to their back. Imagine a tire hiked up right under your chest and around your abdomen,” said &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kim Reiss, M.D." data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Kim Reiss, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist specializing in pancreatic cancer at the University of Pennsylvania.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;3. You develop an unexplained blood clot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Patients with pancreas cancer are particularly prone to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20489603/6-signs-you-might-have-a-blood-clot/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20489603/6-signs-you-might-have-a-blood-clot/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="blood clots" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Lee.   While the exact cause is not known, it is believed that cancer cells reduce production of the proteins the body uses to prevent blood clots.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“For people who do not have a reason for the development of a clot—a recent major surgery, trauma (like a car accident), hospitalization, or prolonged period where you are laying still, or a hereditary predisposition to clotting—we recommend making sure you are up to date on your cancer screening and to check in with your doctor about any other symptoms that may help to identify the source of the clotting abnormality,” said Dr. Lee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;4. Your stool starts to float&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“The pancreas does not just produce insulin; it also produces pancreatic enzymes that help break down fat,” said Dr. Lee. “If there is a blockage in the output of pancreatic enzymes, such as a tumor developing in the pancreas, then fat is not digested as well.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This comes out as foul-smelling “fatty” stools that float to the top of the toilet bowl, and may come many times per day shortly after eating fattier meals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-whites-of-your-eyes-st" data-node-id="20" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;5.

Instances of the disease are pretty rare overall, with pancreatic cancer only accounting for 3% of all cancers in the United States, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, it's more common in men than women. However, a 2023 study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/study-confirms-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-faster-in-women-than-men/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gastroenterology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42860161/study-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-in-young-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rates of pancreatic cancer are rising faster in women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rates of pancreatic cancer are rising faster in women&lt;/a&gt;, especially in women of color, than they are in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This fact, plus the aggressive nature of the illness, are why knowing the symptoms of pancreatic cancer is so important. “It has a high likelihood of spread, or metastasis, to other organs in the body,” said &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neil Woody, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Neil Woody, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic. What's more, the five-year survival rate is only 9%, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Why is the disease on the rise? Part of it is due to increased detection, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Valerie Lee, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Valerie Lee, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Sibley Memorial Hospital. Lifestyle factors may be playing a role as well. Increases in diabetes and obesity—two major risk factors for pancreatic cancer—may also be contributing to the rise in pancreatic cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neil Woody, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Neil Woody, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic; &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Valerie Lee, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Valerie Lee, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Sibley Memorial Hospital; &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kim Reiss, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Kim Reiss, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist specializing in pancreatic cancer at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Why pancreatic cancer is tough to diagnose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose. Only about 10% of pancreatic cancers have a genetic predisposition, and good screenings for the general population have been difficult to establish, said Dr. Woody. “Tests with high likelihood of detecting pancreatic cancer, such as endoscopic ultrasound, are invasive, costly, and may carry risks of complications that outweigh their use as screening tests for the average person,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What’s more, many of the symptoms of pancreatic cancer can be caused by other conditions. Plus, people have almost no symptoms at all until the cancer has spread to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, if you are experiencing any of these warning signs, it’s worth making an appointment with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;1. You have no major risk factors for diabetes but suddenly have it&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The pancreas produces insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. So if blood sugar levels suddenly chance, the pancreas becomes the number one suspect. “When people with no risk factors for &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; (no family history, good diet, thin body type) develop new onset diabetes, or who have a history of well controlled diabetes suddenly find that it becomes difficult to control, it’s reasonable to evaluate why the pancreas may not be functioning as well,” said Dr. Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;2. You experience abdominal pain that feels like you're being squeezed around the middle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The pancreas sits close to a bundle of blood vessels and nerves called the celiac plexus that can cause pain and nerve irritation,” said Dr. Lee. When it happens, the pain is usually pretty encompassing of your abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Patients feel pain from the epigastrum (the area just under the sternum) through to their back. Imagine a tire hiked up right under your chest and around your abdomen,” said &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kim Reiss, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Kim Reiss, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist specializing in pancreatic cancer at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;3. You develop an unexplained blood clot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Patients with pancreas cancer are particularly prone to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20489603/6-signs-you-might-have-a-blood-clot/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Lee. While the exact cause is not known, it is believed that cancer cells reduce production of the proteins the body uses to prevent blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“For people who do not have a reason for the development of a clot—a recent major surgery, trauma (like a car accident), hospitalization, or prolonged period where you are laying still, or a hereditary predisposition to clotting—we recommend making sure you are up to date on your cancer screening and to check in with your doctor about any other symptoms that may help to identify the source of the clotting abnormality,” said Dr. Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;4. Your stool starts to float&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The pancreas does not just produce insulin; it also produces pancreatic enzymes that help break down fat,” said Dr. Lee. “If there is a blockage in the output of pancreatic enzymes, such as a tumor developing in the pancreas, then fat is not digested as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This comes out as foul-smelling “fatty” stools that float to the top of the toilet bowl, and may come many times per day shortly after eating fattier meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;5. The whites of your eyes start to look yellow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The pancreas is located close to the liver, which produces bile. If a tumor prevents the bile ducts from draining bile appropriately, people may develop elevated levels of bilirubin in their body, which translates into jaundice, or a yellowing of the skin. “This is usually best seen in the white of the eyes, and can also lead to itching all over the body, light colored stools, and darkened urine,” said Dr. Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;6. You have very little appetite&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you experience a loss of appetite or feel full after eating very little, this also may be a sign of pancreatic cancer. “The pancreas is nestled right near the first part of the small intestine, and tumors can cause food to back up or not get through to the small intestine as quickly,” said Dr. Reiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News UK</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 20:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxONC1Fcml1SGstR3RDQ091Tkc2YTBTX3FETDZ6bUZrNURlZm1IM0Q0aE8xNUUzZk85cUNZRkpYV1V5MUNTSHJhZjdmd3FLZEloZi14bFFwVm8wS2VzYm1oN2pYQUl4SXphd3BWbDZORU9TbWJ0WVhmallsUGJxNzRXNU1WUTE</guid></item><item><title>吃意大利面让你更快乐，我们有证据- Chowhound</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5aUkFuNGZxcEtoM3A5Z3ljUHdCMnNybFI0Y2dWYllFVnRfZVAxUzFQODNDNXladWIxckdIVUFTXy1GaE1iRElBQTFseTVaWWhDdXZ0ZklSNnhLaEQ3el9XTExsMmcyZXd5QVZJNnVuWnU3SGtuTllrUjJUZWlodw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content" class="article"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a true pasta lover, then you probably understand the struggle. Whether a classic Italian spaghetti Bolognese coated in a delicious, slow-cooked meaty ragù and finished with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese, a &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1757604/aglio-e-olio-simple-sauce/" target="_blank"&gt;three-ingredient aglio e olio for those nights you just don't want to cook at all&lt;/a&gt;, or a simple yet mouthwatering penne marinara, simmered in fresh tomatoes and topped with several basil leaves — the choices are endless. Unfortunately though, so are the carbs as well as the gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to gluten, there are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1693410/gluten-free-pasta-brands-ranked-best-worst/" target="_blank"&gt;gluten-free pasta brands&lt;/a&gt; to choose from. However, that doesn't change the fact that a single serving of your favorite spaghetti carbonara packs over 900 calories. Still, there are very few reasons to completely cut pasta out of your diet, unless you develop an allergy or a medical condition like Celiac disease. For those who can digest gluten, experts suggest that eating it two to three times a week is more than enough. If you're feeling guilty for going over that limit this week, here's something that will surely brighten your day: According to science, pasta actually makes you happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Italian scientists who conducted this research (of course). As a matter of fact, in 2023, the team at the &lt;a href="https://internationalpasta.org/news/pasta-makes-you-happy/" target="_blank"&gt;Behavioral and Brain Lab at Milan's Free University of Languages and Communication (IULM)&lt;/a&gt; used techniques to measure people's brain activity and closely watched participants' behavior. These techniques are close to those one would use for a lie detector test. They actually evaluated the facial reactions, brain activity, heart rate shifts, and micro perspiration of 40 people aged between 25 and 55. Oh, and needless to say, this was all happening as they were consuming pasta. So, what did the results show?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists at IULM were surprised to discover that eating just a single plate of pasta triggered the same kind of positive emotional-cognitive response in the participants as listening to a song played by their favorite band, watching the Olympics, or watching their favorite tennis player land a match-winning shot at Wimbledon. While the team linked this emotional boost to the way pasta, a beloved comfort food, activates memories and feelings of comfort and pleasure, it's now the only study to reveal a link between pasta and happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating a bowl of your favorite pasta dish (and therefore carbs) anywhere — at home or any of the &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1693690/best-italian-restaurants-nyc/" target="_blank"&gt;20 best Italian restaurants in New York City&lt;/a&gt; — releases endorphins, hormones that increase feelings of joy, while reducing stress and anxiety. What's more, pasta is considered a complex carbohydrate. Unlike simple carbs, complex ones are made up of longer chains of sugar molecules, which provide a steadier stream of energy and boost serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because complex carbohydrates support the production of tryptophan, an amino acid and precursor to the so-called feel-good hormone, which plays a great role in mood regulation. And finally, pasta keeps up to 80% of its B-vitamins even after cooking, which, in turn, are essential for converting tryptophan into serotonin. So next time you're feeling a bit down, don't be too hard on yourself, just get that pasta boiling. Then whip up your favorite sauce, mix it all together, and dig right in.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

	Erica Kahn was on vacation in Arizona with her father last year when a wild bat flew into her open mouth.&lt;em&gt; GoFundMe&lt;/em&gt;	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

					
				&lt;/header&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A Massachusetts woman was left on the hook for thousands of dollars in medical bills after a &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/01/06/new-hampshire-elementary-school-closed-after-hundreds-of-hibernating-bats-found-in-building/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; flew into her open mouth during a stargazing trip to Arizona last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica Kahn and her father were snapping long-exposure photos of the nighttime landscape at Horseshoe Bend when a wild bat managed to wedge itself between Kahn’s camera and her face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I was screaming, part of the bat unfortunately went in my mouth (fun fact, they taste earthy and a little sweet!),” Kahn recalled on a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-erica-kahn-with-medical-bills-after-rabies-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; to help cover her subsequent medical bills. She said her father, a doctor, recommended she go to an emergency room to receive &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;post-exposure prophylaxis&lt;/a&gt; for rabies due to the close contact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was a catch: The 33-year-old biomedical engineer was temporarily uninsured, having opted to forgo health insurance after she was laid off last summer. Kahn found an insurance policy online the day after the bat incident and signed up, figuring she’d be covered when she went to the hospital, according to &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/tourist-rabies-treatment-wild-bat-in-mouth-surprise-bill-of-the-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Kahn’s chosen insurer had a 30-day waiting period for benefits to kick in, the news outlet reported. Four hospital visits and seven shots later, Kahn’s medical bills totaled $20,749.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought it must have been a mistake,” she told KFF. “I guess I was naive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., bats are the most-reported animals with rabies, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/bats.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the CDC reports that most people who die of rabies in the U.S. have been exposed to a rabid bat. The agency also notes that bat bites can be tiny, and anyone who gets bat saliva or brain matter in their eyes, nose, mouth, or open wounds should seek urgent medical care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/09/1091797594/the-capitol-fox-fascinated-folks-but-no-one-mentioned-the-cost-of-rabies-treatme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; reports, post-exposure treatment — which usually involves several doses of the rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin — can cost thousands of dollars even before hospital fees kick in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now employed again and working to negotiate and pay down her medical bills, Kahn is turning to GoFundMe for help covering some of the costs. With a fundraising goal of $12,000, she’s also vowed to donate half of the proceeds to UNICEF to support health care for families in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she acknowledged her mistake in declining to stay on her former employer’s insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), Kahn said the cost of her medical care was “pretty extreme.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish our health care system wasn’t so broken in the United States,” she added on her fundraising page. “I believe life-saving medical care is a fundamental human right and it’s depressing that Americans can only turn to GoFundMe instead of a federally protected safety net.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Kahn was adamant she harbors no ill will toward bats. She’s also tried to keep a sense of humor about the ordeal, medical bills notwithstanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As Michael Scott &lt;a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/156289049543354268/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said in The Office&lt;/a&gt;, ‘myth: three Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: *four* Americans every year die from rabies,’” Kahn joked on her GoFundMe.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Washington state officials have revealed that a &lt;a href="https://tpchd.org/news/we-are-investigating-possible-locally-acquired-case-of-malaria/"&gt;local woman has been diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; with malaria, which, if confirmed, would mark the first known case of the disease being acquired in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The woman was diagnosed with malaria, a mosquito-borne illness caused by a parasite, on August 2, according to the officials. State and federal public health agencies are working to confirm the source of the infection, according to a statement published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials believe that the infection may have been transmitted by a mosquito that bit someone else who already had a travel-associated case of malaria. The woman is currently receiving treatment and is being closely monitored. Symptoms of the disease include fever, chills, body aches, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea. It can take up to 30 days for an infected person to start showing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cases of malaria in the U.S. are typically linked to travel—mainly to visitors with ties to sub-Saharan African countries—and the disease is not considered endemic to the U.S. In fact, the U.S. effectively &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/index.html"&gt;eradicated malaria in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt; thanks to aggressive control measures, including pesticides and improved drainage. But the Anopheles mosquito which transmits malaria lives all over the country: If they bite someone infected with the disease, the bugs could feasibly transmit the parasite that causes malaria to other people in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Between 20-70 cases of malaria are recorded in Washington each year and there are typically around 2,000 cases annually across the U.S., according to official estimates. While many are linked to travel, there has been a recent uptick in locally-acquired infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2023, the U.S. experienced its first locally acquired malaria case in 20 years. And between May and October of that year, 10 such cases were reported across Florida, Texas, Maryland, and Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Climate change may be driving the incidence of local malaria infections up: The parasite that causes malaria needs warm temperatures to thrive, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11398779/"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; more cases of the disease could arise in previously malaria-free areas as the planet warms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has historically been the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-freeze-and-global-health-the-biggest-gaps-left-on-the-donor-landscape/"&gt;top donor nation&lt;/a&gt; to global efforts to combat malaria, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-status-of-the-presidents-malaria-initiative-pmi/"&gt;according to health nonprofit KFF&lt;/a&gt;. But those initiatives took a hit when the Trump administration slashed the country’s foreign aid programs earlier this year, including most of the work of the President’s Malaria Initiative—a USAID program launched in 2005 focused on reducing malaria in countries where the disease is endemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of the investigation in Washington, officials are working with the U.S. Department of Health to trap and test mosquitoes. Local authorities have stressed that people in the area of the state where the woman was infected remain at very low risk of contracting malaria.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The risk of getting infected with malaria in Pierce County remains very low,” James Miller, health officer for Tacoma-Pierce County, said in a &lt;a href="https://tpchd.org/news/we-are-investigating-possible-locally-acquired-case-of-malaria/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Malaria is a rare disease overall in the United States—and the vast majority of cases in the United States occur following exposures in countries with ongoing transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;
