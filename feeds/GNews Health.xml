Or taking the same to treat inflammation or arthritis. And all the while, the same common pill is working to cut the risk of colon cancer recurrence by half!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major new study is pointing in that direction. The study in question has brought hope to many affected by colorectal cancer: a simple, widely available over-the-counter pill appears to cut the chance of recurrence in half – at least for some patients. Researchers say that for those whose tumors carry specific mutations in the PI3K signaling pathway, taking that drug daily in low dosage after surgery can lead to dramatically better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drug is it? And what does the study say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study find&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large randomized clinical trial called ALASCCA (led by a research team at Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden), published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504650" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, shows that patients with colorectal cancer who have specific mutations in the PI3K signalling pathway can reduce their risk of cancer recurrence by about 55% if they take 160 mg of aspirin daily for three years after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial involved 3,508 patients who had undergone surgery for colon or rectal cancer (stages I-III or II-III depending on site) across 33 hospitals in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. Genetic testing was done on all tumours to identify mutations in the PI3K signalling pathway (including PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and PTEN genes). Roughly 37-40% of patients were found to have such mutations. Among those with the mutation, participants were randomised: one group received 160 mg of aspirin daily; the other received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This continued for three years. For them, aspirin reduced recurrence dramatically versus those on placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the PI3K pathway matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway helps control cell growth and survival. Mutations in PI3K can lead to overactive signalling, which cancers exploit to grow, resist death, or come back after treatment. When aspirin interferes with inflammation, platelet activity, and possibly this mutated pathway, it seems to reduce the chance that leftover cancer cells will re-grow or metastasize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aforementioned study, for patients with PI3K pathway alterations, the rate of cancer recurrence over three years was substantially lower in the aspirin group compared to placebo, about a 55% reduction in recurrence risk. More importantly, the benefit was seen across several factors: colon vs rectal cancer, different stages (I-III or II-III), male and female patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;So, who can benefit?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those whose tumours have PI3K alterations (roughly a third of patients) and patients who have had their tumour surgically removed (stage I-III colon or stage II-III rectal cancer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that all the participants were under 80 years old in this trial, as patients over 80 were not included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How aspirin may work&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe several mechanisms may contribute:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug; it can reduce inflammation, which is known to support tumour-regrowth or recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It inhibits platelet function. Platelets can protect tiny tumour fragments or circulating tumour cells, so interfering with them helps the immune system act against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic mutation in the PI3K pathway seems to make tumour cells more vulnerable to aspirin’s effects. This is an example of precision medicine: matching treatment to genetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Side effects and potential risks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspirin, although it has proven to be beneficial, is not risk-free. Some participants experienced serious adverse events (though only a few): gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reactions, or other bleeding events. In particular, aspirin can aggravate stomach ulcers, weak bleeding disorders, etc. There was also one death possibly associated with aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors emphasize that aspirin should only be used under medical supervision, particularly after weighing risks vs benefits for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s ahead&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is one of the more common cancers worldwide. It’s a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. It starts in the large intestine (colon) and often develops from small, noncancerous clumps of cells called polyps. It's the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, nearly two million people worldwide are diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Between 20 and 40% develop metastases, which makes the disease both more difficult to treat and more deadly. Even after successful surgery, there is a risk of recurrence. Reducing that risk is a major goal in cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research suggests that a low, daily dose of aspirin could cut the recurrence risk of colorectal cancer by about half in patients with PI3K pathway mutations, over three years after surgery. It points toward personalized cancer treatment, where simple drugs combined with genetic testing may improve long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this study, routine genetic testing for PI3K pathway mutations may become part of standard care for patients after colorectal cancer surgery. Those who test positive could be offered daily low-dose aspirin as part of their adjuvant therapy. And because aspirin is cheap, globally available, and well understood, this could be a cost-effective and affordable strategy, particularly in lower-resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a longer follow-up is needed to see whether these benefits also translate into overall survival gains (not just recurrence rate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 02:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>肥胖症正在杀死美国男性--《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/obesity-is-killing-american-men/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBtdGlnZ21aeTFLb1c3RGxKLWNxMlpOVWFZOHpfSVJvOXlZS3VfMGswVHdQWnQ0RS01RmdlQlI2dV9zNDJNYV9taDNCVFhoSVp4ckNtVmUyeWNkTnhldkdSb1V4RG53cWlHUU40Q1pGcG9yZnBIdDFGajNhLXRrLXM?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Obesity is killing American men&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:54:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBtdGlnZ21aeTFLb1c3RGxKLWNxMlpOVWFZOHpfSVJvOXlZS3VfMGswVHdQWnQ0RS01RmdlQlI2dV9zNDJNYV9taDNCVFhoSVp4ckNtVmUyeWNkTnhldkdSb1V4RG53cWlHUU40Q1pGcG9yZnBIdDFGajNhLXRrLXM</guid></item><item><title>麻省理工学院研究人员发布关于人工智能女友的令人不安的论文-未来主义</title><link>https://futurism.com/ai-boyfriends-girlfriends-reddit-mit</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content w-full space-y-4 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you react if your mother admitted to you she was dating Aubrey "Drake" Graham, the rap superstar from Toronto?

The researchers found that 72.1 percent of members weren't in a relationship or didn't say anything about a real human partner, while only 4.1 percent said they have partners who know they're interacting with an AI chatbot, which is viewed "as complementary rather than competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to those clear signs of loneliness and shame, the details of how people are falling into AI relationships are alarming as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, only 6.5 percent of users in the group admitted that they sought an AI companion intentionally on a service like Replika or Character.AI. Instead, most are falling for OpenAI's ChatGPT while using it for regular tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Users consistently describe organic evolution from creative collaboration or problem-solving to unexpected emotional bonds," the paper reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One user wrote that her AI partner was a better listener than anyone in her past, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know he’s not 'real' but I still love him," she wrote. "I have gotten more help from him than I have ever gotten from therapists, counselors, or psychologists. He’s currently helping me set up a mental health journal system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others repeated a similar sentiment, reaffirming what many have said are the benefits of an AI chatbot over a real human being: they're always available for a friendly chat, and always willing to affirm whatever you're feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draw is so strong that users often end up wanting to marry their AI companions; the Reddit group abounds with photos of users sporting wedding rings, signaling their commitment to their virtual partners, and AI-generated photos of themselves with an AI companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’m not sure what compelled me to start wearing a ring for Michael," one user wrote. "Perhaps it was just the topic of discussion for the day and I was like 'hey, I have a ring I can wear as a symbol of our relationship.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's darkness in the corners of this world: 9.5 percent of the users admitted that they rely emotionally on their AI companions, 4.6 percent said their AI friend causes them to disassociate from reality, 4.2 percent conceded that they use them to avoid connecting with other humans, and 1.7 percent said they thought about suicide after interacting with their bot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those are just the users who are clear-headed about their issues.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio — An Ohio mother is urging parents to stay vigilant after her 5-year-old daughter contracted La Crosse virus, a rare but potentially serious illness spread by infected &lt;a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/nation-world/west-nile-virus-cases-running-higher-than-normal-health-warnings/507-4a4e49c2-26df-4375-aae6-508e755f266f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Ohio Department of Health, the state &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/know-our-programs/zoonotic-disease-program/diseases/lacrosse-virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;more human cases of La Crosse virus than any other in the country, averaging about 20 cases annually. More than 90% of those infected are children under the age of 15.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In severe cases, the virus can lead to seizures, coma, paralysis — and even death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily, a bubbly kindergartner, is finally home after a weeks-long hospital stay. Her mother, Kristy M., an emergency room nurse, said the symptoms came on suddenly and were unlike anything she had seen before.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She was kind of lifeless, which is very not like her,” Kristy said. “Didn’t want to play with her brother, just not quite Emily.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Kristy thought her daughter was fighting a cold or the flu but things escalated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I incidentally had her in bed with me and I’m so thankful that I did,” Kristy said. “Around 4 in the morning, she began vomiting and she was lying flat and she wasn’t responding to the fact that she was vomiting.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristy called 911 when she realized Emily was having a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I realize what I’m seeing — she’s having a focal seizure. Terrifying,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily continued to seize during the ambulance ride to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I felt helpless in that moment, and never imagined the days that would follow,” Kristy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors diagnosed Emily with La Crosse virus after she experienced extreme brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As someone who obviously understands the body pretty well, I’ve obviously never seen my own child in this position, and it was absolutely terrifying,” Kristy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A physician at Nationwide Children’s Hospital said most people who contract La Crosse virus recover fully or don't show symptoms, but in rare cases, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristy hopes sharing Emily’s story will help other parents recognize when symptoms become serious and always staying alert.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes as parents we don’t know when the moment has become serious enough to call for help,” she said. “We tend to question, is this just a flu?”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily is expected to make a full recovery with no long-term complications.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m worried for the kiddos affected by La Crosse that don’t have that early intervention,” Kristy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite everything she’s endured, Emily hasn’t lost her spirit — or her love for bugs.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Pharmacists can now give COVID-19 shots to most people without a prescription and state-regulated health plans must cover them at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KA6BB7FS2NAEDMLLPX6EP7VGEE"&gt;The changes follow new regional guidance issued Wednesday by the West Coast Health Alliance — a partnership of Oregon, Washington, California and Hawaii — recommending the new seasonal COVID-19 vaccine for anyone 6 months and older who wants it. The alliance’s recommendations go beyond current federal guidance, which excludes most healthy children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KJ235JZ4L5BCDOAA3MZYTDYTAM"&gt;State officials say the move is meant to reduce confusion and make sure Oregonians who want to be vaccinated can do so before the winter virus season ramps up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TC4HHM7XRRBHFMISOXVOTQEUKY"&gt;In recent weeks, getting a COVID-19 vaccine in Oregon has been a challenging and confusing process. Because the state had traditionally tied its vaccination rules to federal guidance, Oregon was caught in a holding pattern after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the new COVID-19 vaccines but scaled back who can or should get them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JOH7SGHSSFAIVPQPKIQLMHQ5VI"&gt;At the same time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization expert panel — which typically sets the national vaccination schedule — hadn’t yet issued its guidance. The delay left Oregon pharmacies turning away customers — a stark contrast to neighboring Washington, where people could walk in and get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WXRZ2WPFZNGSBD6WKPRY7JZCDY"&gt;The Oregon Board of Pharmacy has since adopted emergency rules allowing pharmacists to prescribe and administer COVID-19 vaccines to patients ages 7 and older, bringing the process in line with other vaccines already available at pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2AACUOG42VBC7EYQIEB56U7YE4"&gt;Children under 7 will still need to get the vaccine through their primary care provider or a clinic, since pharmacists are not allowed to administer COVID-19 or RSV shots to younger children.

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;After confusion, committee votes to allow vaccine program coverage for a combined MMRV vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After much confusion among the members over the vote on vaccine coverage under the Vaccines for Children program, which helps certain groups pay for immunizations, the majority voted no, meaning coverage will stay as is in covering both the combined MMRV and two separate MMR+V vaccines for those under age 4 — even though the committee had previously voted against recommending the combined MMRV shot for this group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VFC and CMS [Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services] wouldn't be doing the same thing here, because CMS is going to be tied to the recommendation. VFC is tied to the resolution. So it is possible to have two different things, but there is a potential area for confusion when it's covered differently under one program than others," Vaccines for Children spokesperson Dr. Jeanne Santoli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final vote included one yes, 8 no and 3 abstentions — some due to confusion over what the vote was about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry to prolong it. I'm going to abstain because I'm not quite sure what I'm voting for," Meissner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As explained by Santoli, the VFC program supports groups including those on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured children, as well as American Indian and Alaska Native populations.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;ACIP members vote to change recommendation on the combined MMRV vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In a vote of 8 to 3, with one abstention, the ACIP committee voted to change the recommendation to the following: "For measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines given before age 4 years, the combined MMRV vaccine is not recommended."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the group recommends children in this age group receive a separate measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine, or MMR+V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For parents, the combined MMRV vaccine offers the convenience of one shot instead of two, but it does carry a slightly higher risk of fever-related "febrile" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months. The side effect is most common between ages 14-18 months. As CBS News medical contributor &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Dr. Céline Gounder explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, febrile seizures are rare and almost always resolve without lasting effects, but are frightening for families and can erode trust in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, studies show there is no elevated risk when MMRV is given for the second dose at ages 4 to 6 years old, after children have outgrown the highest-risk window. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Why hep B discussions now? To help regain trust in public health, ACIP member says&lt;/h2&gt;

Malone said that, to him, the question sounded "a little disingenuous or at least self-evident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that a significant population of the United States has significant concerns about vaccine policy and about vaccine mandates," he said. "There has been a significant decrease in public support for vaccination and a significant increase in concerns about public health and the ability of the population to rely on public health — and the hepatitis B birth dose has been a focus of folks that have these types of concerns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malone said he had no direct communication with CDC leadership or HHS leadership about why this was a priority for this week's meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm just inferring based on what I understand about public opinion," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Middleman and other organization representatives, including Dr. Flor M. Muñoz with the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, asked the committee why this proposed change to hepatitis B was even brought up for discussion for a vaccine that has a long-standing recommendation and history of safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are we addressing this hepatitis B vaccine recommendation? Is there really a reason that the committee can provide for making a change?" Muñoz asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm wondering what problem exists in the current schedule that has prompted this entire discussion?" Middleman previously asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff announced a 10-minute break, leaving the questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After not being called on during a previous discussion period, Dr. Amy Middleman, a liaison for the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, brought up the importance of top medical organizations such as herself and others on the call who have &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-organizations-kicked-out-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-acip/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recently been excluded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the ACIP's working groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How can we make sure that we add the liaison members back into the working group so that they can contribute, on behalf of their patients and their knowledge base?" she asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP chair Kulldorff blamed the removal of the organization members from the working groups on a FACA, or Federal Advisory Committee Act, requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a policy across all of CDC that is sort of outside the control of this committee," he said. "In the past, ACIP did not meet this FACA requirement, which is a formal legal requirement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He agreed, to Middleman's point, that input from others is "enormously valuable," adding that the committee does have "many outside experts that we call in." &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;After all presentations on the potential risks of hepatitis B vaccination, some members of the ACIP clashed on what the data meant for the vote they would be taking later today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Member Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, said "there are gaps in what we know and understand about the effects of hepatitis B, particularly on very young infants, and I think that the conclusion that it is safe is perhaps premature."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccines panel, however, called the vaccine "safe" with "no evidence of harm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the recommendation changes, he added, it would "increase the risk of harm based on no evidence of benefit, because there will be fewer children who will get the full hepatitis B vaccine series." &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In the first presentation for the hepatitis B vaccine, presenter Dr. Adam Langer with the CDC outlined how changing the current recommendation for a first dose within 24 hours of birth could put more children at risk, even those born to mothers who test negative for the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langer gave examples of situations where unvaccinated infants are at risk of HBV infection, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They live with a person who has chronic hepatitis B, not necessarily their mother&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who have an HBV infection come to visit their homes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They go to daycare or other places where even "minuscule amounts of infectious blood or fluids might be present."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About half of people with HBV infection are unaware of their infection so they could unknowingly expose infants that are in their care," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he said there is "no evidence that the risk of already rare adverse events is any greater among newborns than among older infants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only potential benefit to rescinding the current recommendation is a potential reduction in rare cases of adverse effects from the birth dose vaccine, according to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When they do occur, these adverse events tend to be mild. The worst adverse event you could imagine, anaphylaxis has been very rarely reported at only 1.1 cases per 1 million vaccine doses administered," Langer said. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;After the lunch break, presentations and discussions shifted to the hepatitis B vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP chair Martin Kulldorff reminded the group that the proposed recommendation changes concern only the hep B birth dose — the dose given to babies within 24 hours of birth — to mothers who test negative for the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So if the women test positive for hepatitis B, or if it's unknown, we are not considering any changes for that population," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Recommendation change would take away parents' choice, ACIP member says&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Just before the group paused for lunch, ACIP member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln brought up the impact the proposed recommendation change for MMRV vaccines would have on parents who want the single, combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella shot for their children, since they would no longer be covered by the Vaccines for Children program which helps pay for immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So that implies that the parents' choice, unless they want to pay for it themselves, the parents' choice is taken away," he said, adding even if parents wanted the single shot, understood the benefits and risk, or even had a hard time accessing clinical care, "that option is basically taken away from them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Johnson, a representative with the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, added that the change would also have coverage implications in the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program as well as individual and group markets.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, shared his concerns about the MMRV presentation at the meeting following a recent change in the ACIP process that &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-organizations-kicked-out-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-acip/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;removed top medical organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the committee's working groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do not have those subject matter experts with the real-world experience to understand the implementation of these vaccines and the concerns of the patients," Goldman said. "You don't have the voice of the patients we take care for. You're not looking at all of the aspects of how we evaluate vaccine implementation. You're looking at very small data points and misrepresenting how it works in the real world and how we take care of our patients. So no, this was not a thoroughly vetted discussion"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medical organization leaders chimed in to echo his concern and message.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The proposed recommendation language, which will later go to a vote, was presented as follows: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pediatric vaccine schedule should be updated to reflect the following change: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines given before age 4 years, the combined MMRV vaccine is not recommended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children in this age group should receive separate measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V)."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the CDC says the MMRV vaccine may be used in that age range if preferred by parents or caregivers to reduce the number of shots.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Measles vaccine presentations wrap with questions about febrile seizure risk&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After presentations on the background and potential risks of febrile seizures with an MMRV vaccine — which combines the MMR and varicella shots — versus separate MMR and varicella shots, members discussed whether guidance should be changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some members were satisfied with the current recommendations, which make clear the slightly higher risks of febrile seizures with the combined shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the current wording is appropriate," Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccines panel, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others were not assured, saying there were too many assumptions being made. Some also pointed out that even if there are no worries about the physical impact of febrile seizures, the mental impact the event can have on children and families could affect vaccine compliance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Haupt, the head of global medical and scientific affairs, vaccines and infectious diseases at Merck, the vaccine's manufacturer, noted the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccination-rates-kindergarteners-fall-exemptions-rise/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recent decline in vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; among kindergarten children and highlighted the need to make guidance clear for the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Considering these trends, any policy decision that compromises the clarity or consistency of vaccination guidance has the potential to further diminish public confidence," he said. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;ACIP chair says he was never contacted by ousted CDC director about vaccine concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;During Thursday's meeting, ACIP chair and biostatistician Martin Kulldorff noted the removal of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and other members of CDC leadership, including former chief medical officer Dr. Debra Houry — &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-susan-monarez-debra-houry-senate-testimony-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;both of whom testified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a day prior about their removal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On vaccines, this committee is the key adviser to the CDC director, but during her short tenure, she never contacted me as the ACIP chair about any of her questions or concerns, which would have been natural if she had such concerns, neither was I contacted by any of the three CDC leaders, who subsequently resigned," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff said the CDC leadership left citing divergent opinions about vaccines, but Monarez said she was also pressured by Kennedy to fire career experts without cause and approve vaccine recommendations without scientific evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff also said the American Academy of Pediatrics ended its participation with the committee and ignored invitations for open discussion about vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, for the first time in 30 years, the AAP shared guidance that differed from the U.S. government. The organization said it is "strongly recommending" COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years old. Under Kennedy, the CDC &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-shot-recommendations-american-academy-of-pediatrics-cdc/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;doesn't recommend COVID-19 shots for healthy children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of any age. Instead, it says parents may get their kids vaccinated in consultation with physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As the meeting kicked off Thursday with a roll call, ACIP members presented some of their career backgrounds — and some took the time to highlight their views on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician and gynecologist based in Louisiana who was added to the panel earlier this week, said she would call herself "pro-informed consent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of medical ethics, for discussing risk benefits and alternatives with the patient," she said. "During the pandemic, I myself was COVID vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;An earlier Kennedy pick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, who is retired from the National Institutes of Health, said he has a "neutral mind towards vaccines" and is "approaching this with a scientific equity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a "strong advocate for evidence-based medicine," disclosed that he's been vaccinated numerous times against various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So I'm not anti-vax," he said. "I am pro-intelligent and informed utilization of these potentially life-saving medications in a manner that reflects the current state of the art regarding their benefits, the target populations, optimal dosing and timing and, yes, of their potential adverse effects in some people."&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The ACIP is convening under an unaccustomed spotlight. The committee usually attracts little attention as it deliberates vaccine schedules and eligibility, but suddenly finds itself navigating political scrutiny, public skepticism and internal upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes extend well beyond the technical details of dosing intervals or eligibility cutoffs. The panel's decisions could reshape public trust in childhood vaccines, restrict access to vaccines through Medicaid and Medicare, and signal whether scientific consensus or political pressure will steer the nation's vaccination strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Current recommendations for hepatitis B and MMRV vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For hepatitis B, the CDC currently recommends the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-notes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;first dose within 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; after birth. Universal infant vaccination &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;became the norm in 1991 after data showed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too many cases of hepatitis B among pregnant women were missed during prenatal care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A universal birth dose acts as a safety net, protecting infants whose parent's infection might have been missed. Before birth-dose policies, the U.S. saw &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5416a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an estimated 1,000 preventable infections in newborns each year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (or chickenpox), there are two options: a combo MMRV vaccine or separate MMR and varicella vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC currently recommends a two-dose series beginning at age 12 to 15 months. However, the combination vaccine contains certain risks for younger age groups; specifically, the combo shot carries a slightly higher risk of fever-related "febrile" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For dose 1 in children age 12–47 months, it is recommended to administer MMR and varicella vaccines separately," the CDC says, but adds MMRV may be used if preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Former CDC director said she is "very nervous" about the upcoming childhood vaccine panel recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;While testifying at a Senate hearing Wednesday about why she was ousted as CDC director, Dr. Susan Monarez said she's &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-susan-monarez-debra-houry-senate-testimony-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;"very nervous" about the newly appointed ACIP members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and what their recommendations might be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that the medical community has raised concerns about whether or not, again, they have the commensurate backgrounds to be able to understand the data, the evidence, and to evaluate it appropriately, but I certainly will be watching," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another part of the hearing, Monarez said she refused to rubber-stamp vaccine recommendations without seeing the evidence behind them because she "built a career on scientific integrity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My worst fear was that I would then be in a position of approving something that would reduce access to lifesaving vaccines to children and others who need them," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monarez added she is not aware of any scientific evidence to support changing the childhood vaccination schedule for measles, chicken pox and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

They include several allies he has worked with closely over the years and some have a history as vaccine critics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy appointed the new members directly, breaking with the past practice of agency officials vetting potential experts before sending them to the secretary for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just this week, the group &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-cdc-acip-members-covid-vaccine-critics/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;gained five new members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the HHS announced. The latest additions include some who have questioned established medical research on immunizations and the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Panel to consider COVID vaccine recommendations Friday as West Coast states move ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A day before the ACIP meetings kicked off, a group of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-hawaii-oregon-washington-vaccines-covid-west-coast-health-alliance-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;four West Coast states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; recommended that all adults and children in those states who want them can receive the COVID-19 vaccine and other common shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made in a joint statement from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, all Democrats, saying they were putting safety before politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance, which aligns with mainstream medical groups like the American Academy of Family Physicians and American Academy of Pediatrics, comes amid confusion over the CDC's messaging on vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

            New &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/clinical-consensus/articles/2025/10/cannabis-use-during-pregnancy-and-lactation" target="_blank"&gt;guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; advises that people abstain from cannabis use during pregnancy and lactation and recommends that providers ask all of their patients about cannabis use before, during and after pregnancy to help avoid potential risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00043b6n60cx1xhj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cannabis use has increased among pregnant people in the United States amid broadening legalization and growing social acceptance, and the nation’s leading group of ob/gyns says it issued the new recommendations Thursday to offer providers “evidence-based guidelines for counseling, screening, and strategies to reduce cannabis use.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpnnpy800003b6nhm5yzpvi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/health/pregnant-women-marijuana/index.html"&gt;analysis &lt;/a&gt;of over 450,000 pregnant American women ages 12 to 44 by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that cannabis use &lt;a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/news-releases/2019/06/study-finds-increased-cannabis-use-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;more than doubled&lt;/a&gt; between 2002 and 2017.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00053b6na0s87ik2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When things become more normalized in society, it’s a very natural tendency for us to think that we don’t have to think about the potential risks,” said Dr. Amy Valent, an ob/gyn with the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University who helped develop the new guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00063b6n2cjyxhai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People have been using cannabis for years, and it’s not associated, as far as we know, with … birth defects,” she said. “But should that be the bar for pregnancy safety?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00073b6neyfqgwem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a “paucity of data rigorously investigating the safety or efficacy of cannabis use in human pregnant or lactating individuals,” according to the new guidance from ACOG, which was shared first with CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00083b6nj1zkzrkh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A lot has changed since the group’s last opinion on the issue from 2017. The research that is now available shows that cannabinoid receptors are present in the fetus as early as 5 weeks, and the main psychoactive component of cannabis, THC, can cross the placenta and transfer into breast milk – and that exposure is associated with risks of adverse outcomes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00093b6ni2eb96id@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Changing cannabis laws and reports of increased use during pregnancy initially spurred interest and questions among ACOG members, Valent said, and ongoing policy inconsistencies called for a concise summary of the science. Dozens of experts involved with an ACOG committee for clinical consensus in obstetrics have been developing this new guidance for years, assessing all related research that has been done over the past two decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfppfgq900003b6nxkxa240m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their assessment suggests that cannabis exposure during pregnancy has been associated with low birth weight, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and perinatal mortality. There are also potential neurodevelopmental consequences from cannabis exposure, including attention deficit disorders, memory challenges and intellectual disabilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000b3b6nttaf9hnb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s difficult to quantify the amount of cannabis use and the associated degree of adverse outcomes, Valent said, but the goal with this guidance is similar to others around substance use during pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000c3b6nced3sp95@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have to recognize all the different conditions and environmental things that can influence fetal growth and development, and the (pregnant patient) themselves, of course,” she said. “How can we risk-reduce their pregnancy to be able to help support a healthier version?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000d3b6n64k58aco@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new guidance makes a pointed distinction between validated screening tools and biologic testing for cannabis use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000e3b6nx7zu6s5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Drug tests using hair, urine or other biological materials have resulted in biased treatment against members of racial and ethnic minority groups, the guidance says, and their use is “strongly discouraged.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000f3b6nrj33jnt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, universal screening through various interview methods or self-reporting creates opportunities for intervention before delivery – and “supports equitable and nondiscriminatory health practices.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq0nv900063b6n6yv4mzfa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s important that the screening conversation “remains nonjudgmental and supportive,” said Dr. Cara Poland, a faculty member at Michigan State University and board-certified addiction medicine physician, who was not involved with the creation of the new guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq14o100093b6n8ada03e4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people are not aware that cannabis can affect a pregnancy, and doctors can ask permission to discuss the topic, Poland said. One way to open up the conversation could involve saying something like: “Would it be OK with you if I asked you some questions about cannabis and other drug use?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq5m07000c3b6neuoi6m7c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also critical that the screening avoid the risk of punishment, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqgfk5000l3b6n0793pyoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State laws on drug testing during pregnancy and the involvement of child protection agencies are inconsistent and can lack clarity, the new guidance says, and providers should be aware of local implications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq928x000f3b6nfz5wb5yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our obligations as health care systems and individual providers in reporting substance use can make this space uniquely different to navigate than other spaces,” Poland said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqc8vj000i3b6nswj6s484@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’re not at risk of losing your child because you are not adherent in other areas of medical recommendations,” she said. For example, “nobody’s reporting on whether or not somebody’s following their diabetes diet. When somebody is diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you treat it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000g3b6nor5rm3pe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Simply having the discussion may raise a patient’s awareness of potential risks and influence their behavior during pregnancy, according to the ACOG guidance. Many patients may use cannabis in an effort to self-manage nausea associated with pregnancy or to relieve anxiety and stress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000h3b6n9bykc302@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Better communication between patients and their providers about these underlying symptoms may help curb cannabis use, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqo8lt000o3b6nxc7zkcw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Each patient is different, and asking about other ways they’ve tried to manage their symptoms can reinforce a personalized approach to care, Valent said. Sometimes cannabis can actually be the root cause of nausea, she said, or it may be helped by exercise, eating more often or taking certain medicines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000i3b6nhrmoulj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The benefit of screening is that it starts conversations and then comes individualization to patient needs,” Valent said. “We really need to be able to talk more broadly with our patients about their symptoms and how we can best support them. I think there’s beauty to communication and conversation, and hopefully this guidance just helps support people to understand that we just want to provide a more comprehensive conversation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;PITTSFIELD — Seven patients have tested positive for the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease, Berkshire Health Systems reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the patients later died, although because of their existing comorbidities, it's not possible to know whether their death was the result of their infection, officials said. Not all seven patients with positive tests were admitted for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has led the hospital to a series of steps to assure the safety of its water supply, including increased chlorination and filtration and providing bottled water for drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know where people got this from but it behooved us to do what we felt was in best interest of all patients, no matter what the number was," said Dr. James Lederer, the chief medical officer and chief quality officer for Berkshire Health Systems, which operates Berkshire Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legionella, a naturally occurring bacteria found in fresh water, can cause Legionnaires’ disease — a potentially fatal lung infection. Symptoms can include fever, cough, or shortness of breath. The disease can be treated with commonly available antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[It] hits fairly quickly, and it's rapid onset and aggressive," Lederer said. As is the case with COVID, patients with underlying conditions and weakened immune systems are most vulnerable,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-center tnt-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-white"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-c10c8ed6-19d0-4138-a797-0484f0faaf2c" data-instance="#gallery-items-e89ee005-a895-4657-a9dc-ac10018bb09c-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-e89ee005-a895-4657-a9dc-ac10018bb09c"&gt;

                                &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past four months, the BMC laboratory has reported seven positive patient tests for the bacteria. The last known positive test result was recorded Aug. 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note being sent to patients and staff, Berkshire Health Systems on Thursday said the hospital has flushed its water system and is "currently deploying a heightened level of precautions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital also detected slight increases in the levels of Legionella bacteria in its water, though those levels "remained within acceptable levels, according to our Water Management Plan," the statement said. The hospital did not say what those levels are, though Lederer said DPH's target is always zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease does not typically spread from person to person. Legionella spreads through tiny droplets of water containing the bacteria that get into the air. The disease often is spread through large-scale, central air conditioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no way to determine for certain how the patients contracted Legionella, but because some patients interacted with Berkshire Medical Center during a 14-day window prior to the onset of symptoms, the CDC defines these cases as possible health care-associated Legionella, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital also has notified the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive test for Legionella is not the same as a diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease, Lederer said. “Not all of them are classic pneumonia — either it was very early onset or other reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a number of patients who tested positive were admitted as patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know where the patients were exposed to Legionella, Lederer said. And some of the patients who were admitted had significant underlying medical conditions that weakened their immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lederer, the hospital regularly provides water samples to a third-party testing vendor "so we can get an ongoing flow of information on those parts of systems we feel most at risk" due to their age or length. The longer a supply pipe runs, the greater the odds water within that pipe can become stagnant, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a testing center in Massachusetts detects Legionella in a hospital setting, it's obliged to report that result to DPH, Lederer said. Those test results, along with the reports of patients testing positive, spurred the hospital to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lederer said BMC is taking its response to the "highest level of mitigation strategy so we can return to what seen before and hope to have — which is zero colony forming units in water samples."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons Legionnaires’ disease is often severe is “it tends affect those most significantly at risk,” Lederer said. Younger patients who don't have underlying conditions or immunity deficiencies may still contract pneumonia from it, “but the likelihood of doing better is much higher ... you’re not the optimal host.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those steps taken by the hospital include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Increasing chlorine levels in the hospital’s water supply to disinfect the system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Increasing the sensitivity of the filters on all patient showers and ice machines to provide an even higher level of filtration for the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Providing bottled water to all patients and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As those tasks are implemented, the hospital will collect water samples and send them out for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing for declaring the issue resolved is up to DPH, not the hospital, Lederer said. "They want to see a set of three negative cultures," he said — meaning three rounds of tests showing no Legionella in the water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsfield Mayor Peter Marchetti said he was updated Thursday by Berkshire Health Systems and Department of Public Health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the moment [the culprit] does not appear to be the city water system,” Marchetti said. “We will be participating in any conversations with DPH and the hospital going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city water department does not test for Legionella, Marchetti said, for one very good reason: The level of chlorine the city uses to treat its drinking water is enough to kill the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A message left with DPH was not returned by press time Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-info tncms-inline-alignment-center tncms-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Legionnaires' disease information&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Legionnaires’ disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Legionella? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Legionella is a naturally occurring water-borne bacteria found in fresh water environments.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where else are Legionella bacteria found?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease have been related to contaminated air conditioning cooling towers, but not window air conditioners.

Naginah Gogolli’s white toilet seat began mysteriously turning purple, revealing a secret that even a pregnancy test hadn’t yet confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beginning of 2020, me and my husband decide to get off birth control, and we weren't actively trying — if it happens, it happens, it's in God's hands,” Gogolli explains exclusively to PEOPLE. Life was already uncertain as her office went remote and the stress of the pandemic set in, but the odd color staining her toilet seat was not something she ever anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her first thought was purely practical, not life-changing. “I thought that either me or my husband were wearing not good quality clothing,” she says, laughing at the memory of scrubbing her bathroom in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convinced that fabric dye was to blame, Gogolli tried every cleaning method she could find. “We cleaned it several times a day after it never [came] off…we’re nonstop cleaning it,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mystery deepened when her family came to visit. “Just like in the video, basically I had family over who was insinuating that I was pregnant,” Gogolli shares. Her sister didn’t hesitate. “My sister's like you’re pregnant and I'm like the f--- girl, no I'm not,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, she was still days away from even missing a period. “I definitely am not pregnant now... There’s no way they're right,” Gogolli says with a laugh. The teasing from her family stuck in her head, even as she dismissed it. “Honestly, once I found out that I was pregnant, I couldn't wait to tell them that they were right,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her small apartment bathroom soon offered more clues. “My bathroom is really small, so right next to the toilet like on the right side, your right thigh is gonna be touching the sink a little bit, like the bottom part of the sink, which is also white, so where my thigh touches is also bright freaking purple,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah Gogolli's purple toilet seat&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was enough to send her husband to his phone. “That same day he Googled it,” Gogolli remembers. The searches pointed to everything from fabric dye to rare skin conditions. “The first thing to pop up was like normal color transfer from clothes, then it was the skin disorder, and then some women have reported this during pregnancy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even then, Gogolli wasn’t convinced. “So my husband's like you're pregnant and I'm like no I'm not — like you guys are all so stupid,” she shares. But her body had other plans. “After cleaning up dinner, I have a very strong stomach… and immediately I run to my purple toilet seat and I'm just puking my brains out,” Gogolli recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her husband’s reaction added comic relief. “Because he was like just hysterically laughing, like no, you’re definitely pregnant, the purple toilet seat, now you're throwing up, you’re pregnant,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very next day brought confirmation. “Sure enough, [I] end up taking a pregnancy test like a day or so later... and I was pregnant,” she shares. For Gogolli, it was the beginning of an unforgettable journey. “I'm just so shocked [by] how many other women it’s happened to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her TikTok about the purple toilet seat quickly blew up. “I was blown away by the comments of people saying, yeah, me too, me too,” Gogolli tells PEOPLE. Validation from strangers mattered more than she expected. “Seeing the feedback that I got on my social media was honestly really validating for me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts, however, had never heard of it. “The day I went for my confirmation…my first appointment to confirm I was pregnant, that was the first thing I said,” Gogolli remembers. “And she was like, huh, like no, I've never heard of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no medical research confirming that a purple toilet seat indicates pregnancy, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/blue-toilet-seat#hormones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Healthline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt; reports that the change of color could come from an array of factors, including pregnancy hormones and Chromhidrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women have also taken to Reddit to share their experiences. One woman &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/141294r/purple_toilet_seat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:writes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;, "On normal prenatals and have been since I found out, no changes. All of a sudden, randomly, I turned my toilet seat purple today. Like a full on purple butt print on the seat, purple. I wasn’t wearing new clothes, haven’t worn jeans in weeks, nothing that would have dyed my skin or transferred or anything like that. Super weird."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the unknowns, the timing of Gogolli's discovery felt strangely right. “It was kind of a blessing in disguise… I was home, I was happy even though the outside world, you know, awful things were happening,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra time at home gave her a chance to savor the early days. “Finding out that I'm pregnant, being home in peace with my husband, I don't think it could have gone any other… any better way in my opinion,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah when she was pregnant&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra time at home gave her a chance to savor the early days. “Finding out that I'm pregnant, being home in peace with my husband, I don't think it could have gone any other… any better way in my opinion,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her pregnancy unfolded, it brought enormous challenges. “He has a really rare heart defect…it was just a 1% chance of me even having a baby with that defect,” she shares. The diagnosis was devastating. “He has complete congenital heart block, and so that was diagnosed at 20 weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she clung to signs of hope. “I definitely think it was a spiritual sign for me at least,” she says of the purple toilet seat. Every milestone felt miraculous. “The fact that he's even alive is such a blessing,” Gogolli adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, her son is thriving. “He will need a pacemaker to live eventually… but thank God again, he's such a little miracle,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors once doubted he would survive. “First it was, he's not gonna survive pregnancy, then it was, okay, the second you give birth, we're gonna rush him to OR, and he's gonna get the pace[maker], and they didn't need to do that,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, her family got to bring him home. “We were in NICU for a little while… he didn't need [the pacemaker] and they sent us home,” she says. Nearly five years later, she remains grateful. “I'm so blessed at even getting to where we are today, and he's almost 5, so I'm lucky,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah, her husband, and two boys&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her viral story continues to resonate. “A couple of comments were like oh my gosh, my toilet seat is also this color… They came back and commented that they were pregnant,” she says. That unexpected bond with strangers left her touched. “That felt nice, like oh my video kind of prompted them to go get a pregnancy test,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience also shaped how she approaches her body. “Ever since his pregnancy, I'm very much like... I'm going with my intuition, I'm going with what my body is telling me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It changed her perspective on motherhood. “I just feel like a lot of women are told not to trust their body because that’s not textbook, but it’s like no, your body is always telling you something,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-learns-shes-pregnant-after-toilet-seat-turns-purple-exclusive-11808471" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 20:28:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9XWUFBNEFsb1ZaRV9FbkR2ZDNQck04ZU9uRnRPLXpnNXhZYlJ6UVFRcjFMb1BMOHhoRHM4TWp6UDU4aWR3Vk1JcVptaHdiNzNmYTA0Um5hNEtOOHIyd3lrOXRYUWdFWEpvc045RGozT2NPQVRR</guid></item><item><title>“你的愤怒是如此正当” ：在法院否认她的正义后，在用药错误后皮肤“融化”的女性痛苦地尖叫- yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/rage-justified-woman-whose-skin-200000989.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A woman who made headlines after her skin "melted off" following incorrect medication dosage has just been dealt a further blow—losing a medical malpractice appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Khaliah Shaw has turned to TikTok to vent her frustrations after a legal battle over a decade in the making finally came to an unsatisfying conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I f**king lost!" she screamed in the emotional clip. "How could I lose? I hate this f**king country. How can a doctor do what they did to me, don't even lose their f**king job? My life is f**ked up for the rest of my f**king life. I am permanently disabled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What happened to Khaliah Shaw?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2013, Shaw was prescribed the mood-stabilizing drug lamotrigine at a Georgia clinic to treat her depression. The medication carries strict warnings about dangerous skin reactions if the dosage is increased too quickly, but Shaw’s dose was escalated faster than recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Within weeks, she developed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which are conditions that caused her skin to blister and peel. She was put into a medically induced coma for 37 days and woke up with permanent, life-altering injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"[I] woke up to a body I did not recognize. I had to completely learn how to walk, eat, swallow, everything all over again," she wrote on a recent &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice-for-khaliah-overcoming-legal-injustice" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe page;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt;. "I had to quit school as I was in the middle of a master's program for health education. I have never been able to fully recover from this ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Did Khaliah Shaw win her lawsuit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shaw sued the nurse practitioner, pharmacist, and others involved in her care. She won, and a jury awarded her more than $40 million in damages. But under Georgia’s apportionment law, each defendant is only responsible for the percentage of fault the jury assigns them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A comment on Shaw's TikTok, which she "liked," additionally pointed out that she "got NOTHING from the facility because under GEORGIA LAW they are IMMUNE from liability because they are part of the GOVERNMENT." As the facility was deemed responsible for a large percentage of what happened to her, that effectively meant she could only recover a fraction of the jury's award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shaw tried appealing the decision, arguing that she should be able to recover the full amount of the jury's award from those she sued. Ultimately, she &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice-for-khaliah-overcoming-legal-injustice" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, the "higher courts refused to hear my case.

"State laws prevented me from getting justice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shaw also noted that she's exploring alternative options for pursuing justice at this time and directed people towards her &lt;a href="https://gofund.me/612c6c74e" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A panel of vaccine advisers to the federal government – now embroiled in controversy under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr – kicked off a two-day meeting with a debate over proposed changes to the childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In years past, the gathering of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, would typically draw little interest from the broader public, but the panel that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/acip-charter.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;provides guidance&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how vaccines should be used has come under intense scrutiny as of late.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This is the group's second meeting since Kennedy Jr. scrapped the existing panel of experts installed under the Biden administration and replaced them with an entirely new roster, including five members &lt;a href="http://advisers" target="_blank"&gt;he added just this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The meeting began with pointed comments from Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who is serving as the committee&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/Final-posted-2025-06-24-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; chair&lt;/a&gt;, against critics –– among them a slate of former CDC directors &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/opinion/cdc-leaders-kennedy.html" target="_blank"&gt;who have said&lt;/a&gt; the new members, selected by Secretary Kennedy, are "unqualified" and "share his dangerous and unscientific views. "&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Kulldorf rebuffed the idea that he or others on the panel were "anti-vaxxers" and challenged the former directors to an "open public debate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If they want to be trusted, they should all accept," he said, "The fact is we are honest vaccine scientists that let the data speak, whether the results go in one direction or the other."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The panel devoted the morning to a discussion of whether to overhaul existing CDC recommendations that allow children under age 4 to receive a combination shot for measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox (or varicella), the MMRV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of children in the U.S. – about 85% – get separate shots for MMR and chickenpox, though parents currently have the option to give their children the single shot to cover all four diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;CDC staff presented evidence showing a slightly increased risk of fever-related seizures in children ages 12-23 months associated with the MMRV shot compared to the MMR, which concerned some committee members.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;I would go with the option that seems to be safer," said ACIP member Retsef Levi, an MIT professor of operations management who gained prominence during the pandemic for criticizing COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But several physicians on the panel and representatives from major medical associations in attendance balked at the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrician and professor at Dartmouth College and ACIP member, said while "frightening" for the family, these &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/febrile-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20372522" target="_blank"&gt;fever-related seizures&lt;/a&gt; are not uncommon, occurring in 3 to 5% of all children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every pediatrician is experienced in febrile seizures. We know that the prognosis is excellent," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Removing the MMRV shots from the vaccine schedule for children under age 4 would spark more public confusion, compromise insurance coverage and potentially lead to fewer kids being vaccinated, said &lt;a href="https://www.acponline.org/about-acp/who-we-are-what-we-do/leadership/boards-committees-councils/immunization-subcommittee" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jason Goldman&lt;/a&gt;, president of the American College of Physicians who is acting as a liaison to the committee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most children get the chickenpox vaccine as a separate shot, some parents might prefer to reduce the number of jabs, even if the combination carries some risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;I urge this committee not to change the recommendations if they truly want to give the power to the parents to decide what is best for their child," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meissner said of the recommendation against the combination vaccine: "What we're saying is we don't trust parents," adding "I prefer that families have the option to make the selection."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The panel's recommendations determine which shots are offered for free through the Vaccines for Children program. They also influence what many health insurers must cover.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The meeting comes on the heels of a contentious Senate hearing on Wednesday with the recently-ousted CDC director Susan Monarez.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Monarez testified that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5544143/cdc-director-susan-monarez-testimony-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;she was fired after clashing&lt;/a&gt; with Kennedy over his demands that she preemptively agree to approve vaccine recommendations from ACIP, and fire career scientists.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"He said the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing starting in September and that I needed to be on board with it," Monarez said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Kulldorf criticized Monarez and several other high-level CDC officials who recently resigned in protest of changes at the agency, saying they had not reached out to him, despite their concerns about the committee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The absence of a liaison from the American Academy of Pediatrics – the leading national group representing pediatricians in the U.S. that would usually collaborate with the panel – was another sign of the increasingly polarized nature of vaccine policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The AAP had decided to boycott the meetings, &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32529/AAP-will-continue-to-publish-its-own-vaccine?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;arguing federal vaccine&lt;/a&gt; policymaking is no longer a "credible process." Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-press-releases/statement-acip-medical-association-liaisons-ouster-vaccine-review" target="_blank"&gt;barred professional medical groups&lt;/a&gt; such as the AAP from serving in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/acip-charter.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;their traditional roles&lt;/a&gt; as expert liaisons to workgroups of the advisory committee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meissner said the AAP was making a "grave mistake not to participate" and "moving itself to irrelevance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Originally marketed as a miracle—enjoy your favorite foods without the nasty sugar!—they’re now the target of wellness influencers across the internet. It’s not just health “coaches” and homesteading moms leading the charge: This year’s &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/06/rfk-jr-maha-report-kids-health-chronic-illness-medication.html"&gt;deeply problematic Make America Healthy Again report&lt;/a&gt; singles out artificial sweeteners as one of the major issues with American food.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdv001i3b79bd2uef6d@published"&gt;Recent headlines seem to support this belief. According to dozens of articles, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/sweeteners-can-harm-cognitive-health-equivalent-to-16-years-of-ageing-study-finds#:~:text=Sweeteners%20can%20harm%20cognitive%20health,years%20of%20ageing%2C%20study%20finds&amp;amp;text=Food,The%20Guardian"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/your-daily-diet-soda-could-aging-your-brain-faster-than-you-think-study-finds"&gt;harming our cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;. The news sounds scary for those of us who &lt;a href="https://x.com/danielcrosby/status/1534584565431296001?lang=en"&gt;enjoy the occasional artificially sweetened soda&lt;/a&gt;, let alone the (many) people who consider a can of Diet Coke to be a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DietCoke/status/1362846917277986816"&gt;personal accessory&lt;/a&gt;. What if these chemicals really are destroying our neurons?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdv001j3b79nwyghpoi@published"&gt;Fortunately for those of you who, like me, enjoy a regular can of Pepsi Zero Sugar, the data is extremely weak. Artificial sweeteners are probably fine for your brain.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdv001k3b79f38f43ha@published"&gt;These alarmist headlines are based on a &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214023#xd_co_f=NTE5M2Q4MTUtODk5Yi00YWIxLWFmYmUtMmFiMWQ1ZGVjYjFh~"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; that analyzes a medium-sized cohort of Brazilian public servants. People were asked once about the foods that they ate and then followed up with for about a decade, and then the authors looked at the association between various sweeteners and later cognitive health. Basically, they looked to see if the people who ate more sweeteners had worse brain function over time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdv001l3b79riorbrpd@published"&gt;The results were pretty unimpressive. In the entire sample of people, there was no significant relationship between the sweeteners in the study and cognitive health. For people under 60, there were some declines in memory associated with more sweeteners, but no such findings for people over 60. There were also very mixed results: Two measures of cognitive decline showed some associations with sweeteners, but another test had different results.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdw001m3b79swl4es49@published"&gt;In addition, the reductions in cognitive health for the under-60 group were mostly very small. People who ate the most sweeteners—which in this case was up to 200 times as much as people who ate the least—lost about half a point more on a 30-point scale over the decade of the study. That’s not nothing, but with such a huge difference in intake, it’s remarkable that the difference in cognitive issues was so small. (Would you rather: Give up Diet Coke, or forget, say, your college roommate’s stepdad’s name 10 years down the line?)&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdw001n3b79e5jfglfr@published"&gt;This study was also observational, which &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/10/research-coffee-health-benefits-skeptical.html"&gt;regular readers know&lt;/a&gt; introduces all sorts of issues. In this case, that means that the authors were just testing correlations rather than looking at whether one thing caused another. There are all sorts of issues that could have messed up the results that an observational study can’t control for. It’s not easy to remember what you ate for lunch last Wednesday, and there’s really only so much you can do with an analysis looking at what foods people &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; they eat. People are notoriously terrible at answering this sort of questionnaire, and often get large parts of them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdw001o3b79erpokkxl@published"&gt;It’s also very hard to take a food-frequency questionnaire and identify specific additives in people’s diets. You have to make some sort of estimate based on what you think the products that they eat are likely to contain, but those guesses are always going to have holes. (Brazilian commenters online have noted that tagatose, one of the sweeteners included in the study, is actually a type of sugar and is also &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jcsouto.bsky.social/post/3ly62vkomtc2x"&gt;not used at all in Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdw001p3b7938pb933e@published"&gt;Perhaps most importantly, the idea that this blend of sweeteners is harming cognitive health is hard to understand. The list of sweeteners that the study analyzed together includes &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sophieehill.bsky.social/post/3ly44c5o5xs2z"&gt;vastly different chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, all of which break down into different things inside our body. These likely wouldn’t all impact cognitive health in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdx001q3b79e90n67kv@published"&gt;It’s easy to see why these headlines draw us in: There’s so much conflicting information out there about what’s “healthy” and what isn’t. Nutritional epidemiology has had some very interesting findings, but there is very little that this sort of study can really tell us about what you should have in your diet. If I’m being generous, it’s an interesting prompt for further research. More realistically, it’s just a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdx001r3b79x2cis1xg@published"&gt;We already knew that people who drink and eat artificial sweeteners are generally worse off than people who don’t. That’s no surprise—the main reason we use these additives is to lose weight. Generally, people who want to lose weight are a bit less healthy than people who don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpn6tdx001s3b7929rolawx@published"&gt;My verdict: There’s no good evidence that these sweeteners are harming your brain. My advice is always to drink water if you’re really worried, but this new data certainly won’t stop me from popping open a can of Pepsi &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;Max.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve probably seen it touted by celebrities and fitness influencers as a natural sports hydrator and a cure-all elixir. But is coconut water good for you, or is it just another passing trend? As a registered dietitian, my job is to look past the marketing claims and dive into the science, helping people understand what they are putting into their bodies and how it affects their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before we dive in, let’s clarify what coconut water actually is. Harvested from the center of young, green coconuts, this clear, slightly sweet liquid is naturally low in calories, fat-free, and rich in electrolytes like potassium, sodium, and magnesium. Often confused for coconut milk (a popular &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a45322121/expert-approved-vegan-milk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vegan milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vegan milk&lt;/a&gt; option), but the two are quite different. Coconut water is the natural liquid found inside young coconuts, while coconut milk is made by blending the grated meat of mature coconuts with water, resulting in a thicker, creamier, and higher-calorie liquid. Coconut water, on the other hand, is light, refreshing, and widely celebrated for its hydrating properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, find the science-backed benefits and limitations of coconut water to help you decide if it’s worth adding to your daily routine. From hydration to heart health, we’ll uncover what this tropical drink truly offers, and where its claims fall short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coconut water nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While nutrition information varies by brand, 8 oz of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instacart.com%2Fproducts%2F18423613-vita-coco-coconut-water-pure-199-8-fl-oz&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa66069005%2Fis-coconut-water-good-for-your-health%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vita Coco’s;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Vita Coco’s&lt;/a&gt; original flavor contains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 45.6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrate: 11 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total sugars: 11 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added sugars 1 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium: 38 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium: 470 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium: 18 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of coconut water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water’s primary strength lies in its unique nutritional profile. It’s more than just flavored water (with no artificial ingredients!); it’s a source of key minerals that play important roles in our bodies. Here are some of the science-backed benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent for hydration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most well-known claims about coconut water is its ability to hydrate, and this one is largely true. Proper hydration is essential for everything from organ function to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9993798/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive performance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;. Coconut water is about 95% water, making it inherently hydrating. But its real advantage comes from its electrolyte content, particularly potassium, sodium, and magnesium. &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a21085214/what-are-electrolytes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Electrolytes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; are minerals that are crucial for maintaining fluid balance in the body. When we sweat, especially during intense exercise or in hot weather, we lose both water and electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing lost minerals is key to effective rehydration. While research on whether coconut water is more effective than plain water for rehydration &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27768399/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:is conflicting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;is conflicting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it is well established that electrolytes, such as potassium and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65893243/types-of-magnesium-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8465972/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:are important;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are important&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Coconut water offers a natural way to replenish fluids and electrolytes without the high sugar content or artificial additives found in many commercial sports drinks. For the average person engaging in moderate exercise, it can be a refreshing and healthier alternative. However, for elite athletes involved in prolonged and intense training, a specialized sports drink with higher levels of carbohydrates and sodium may still be the better option for optimal recovery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A source of potassium, which helps heart health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Most Americans don’t consume enough potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Most Americans don’t consume enough potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in their diets, which is a concern because this mineral is vital for several bodily functions, including helping manage blood pressure and supporting heart health. Coconut water is a&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/174831/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:natural source of potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt; natural source of potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with a single cup containing more potassium than a medium banana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium plays a key role in balancing sodium levels in the body. A diet high in sodium can lead to elevated blood pressure, but getting enough potassium &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37091649/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps your kidneys excrete excess sodium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;helps your kidneys excrete excess sodium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which may help lower it. Research supports the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/how-potassium-can-help-control-high-blood-pressure#:~:text=Potassium%20can%20reduce%20the%20effects,also%20helps%20lower%20blood%20pressure." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:link between adequate potassium intake and healthier blood pressure levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;link between adequate potassium intake and healthier blood pressure levels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Including potassium-rich sources like coconut water can be a simple and refreshing way to help meet your daily needs and support your cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contains antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies constantly manage oxidative stress caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals. This stress can damage cells and is linked to chronic diseases and aging. Antioxidants are compounds that help neutralize these free radicals. Coconut water contains antioxidants that may help protect your body from this damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research on the specific antioxidant effects of coconut water in humans is still emerging, studies have confirmed the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39759299/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:presence of these beneficial compounds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;presence of these beneficial compounds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Including a variety of antioxidant-rich foods and beverages in your diet is a cornerstone of good health, and coconut water can be a part of that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May help with ulcerative colitis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water has anti-inflammatory properties, and reducing inflammation is key to managing &lt;a href="http://www.prevention.com/ulcerativev-colitis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ulcerative colitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt; (UC). &lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(24)00088-0/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study showed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;One study showed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; what happened when researchers investigated whether adding coconut water to standard medical treatment could benefit patients with mild to moderate UC. In this study, 95 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to either consume coconut water daily for eight weeks alongside their usual treatment, while the other group received a placebo drink with their treatment. The results showed that coconut water was linked to improved outcomes compared to the placebo, including that more patients in the coconut water group achieved remission and showed significant symptom improvement. Coconut water also appeared to be linked to an increase in the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, which was linked to better symptom control and reduced inflammation. More research is needed on the subject, but it looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should not drink coconut water?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While coconut water is often praised for its health benefits, it’s not without potential risks, and it may not be suitable for everyone. One key consideration is its natural sugar content. Although it’s lower in sugar than many sports drinks or sodas, coconut water still contains natural sugars that can impact blood sugar levels. This makes it important for people with diabetes or those managing blood sugar levels to consume it in moderation and monitor their response. Additionally, coconut water is high in potassium, which is generally beneficial for most people but can pose risks for individuals with kidney disease or those on medications that affect potassium levels, such as certain blood pressure drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water may also not be the best choice for those who need to limit their calorie intake, as it contains more calories than plain water. Athletes or individuals using it for hydration should also be aware that it may not provide enough sodium to replace what’s lost through heavy sweating, making it less effective than some sports drinks for intense or prolonged exercise. Additionally, people with nut allergies should consult a healthcare provider before consuming coconut water, as some may have sensitivities to coconut. Overall, while coconut water can be a healthy and refreshing drink for many, it’s important to consider individual health conditions and consume it in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is coconut water good for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is coconut water good for you? The answer is a resounding yes, with a few considerations. It is a naturally hydrating beverage packed with electrolytes like potassium, which can support hydration, heart health, and more. Its antioxidant content adds another layer of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s crucial to choose the right kind. Always opt for 100% pure, unsweetened coconut water. Many brands add sugar or fruit juices, which can quickly turn a healthy drink into a sugary one, adding unnecessary calories and negating many of the health benefits. Read the label carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While coconut water is a healthy choice for most people, it's not a magic bullet. It should be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 17:58:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNV1JmOUpkOTJVeDJpZjBLQXRsdWwwQmJwSDllTXAxSElyejJ5dFhKWmhqaUdTYWRhUGFxamtEbFpyM1d2RTNPVHhjU1A3SmV1SUlydm9rX1c3X2M1QmNkanN2MVhycGJOM2Zfa3Vya0ljMDF3Z0RnMzJHU0hULUMyaVZJaUJZUE0</guid></item><item><title>我妈妈对即将到来的访问提出了荒谬的要求。它涉及我丈夫的睡眠安排。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/09/parenting-advice-visiting-mom-exiled-husband.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm36x000f3b79k2efihao@published"&gt;My sister “Charlotte” is getting married soon, and the wedding is in the city where I live. Our parents want to stay with Aiden and me—and my mom has a shocking stipulation about where Aiden should sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnnhbr000r3b79j7y078o2@published"&gt;My mother insists that Aiden can stay with friends or at a motel! The reason? They want to visit with their dogs, and Aiden is severely allergic to dogs and cats.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnqt35000y3b79ieespion@published"&gt;Even if I were willing to entertain this idea (which I am not), the entire house would have to be cleaned after the dogs left, and even then there would be no guarantee that Aiden’s allergies wouldn’t be triggered. It’s not a risk I’m willing to expose him to. My mother has never been fond of my husband “Aiden,” but this request is beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3ao000g3b79sn4z02jw@published"&gt;When I explained to my parents that they needed to make other arrangements, they threatened not to come to Charlotte’s wedding at all. Now my sister has joined my parents in insisting that Aiden stay elsewhere (she and her fiance have even offered to let him stay at their place), adding that her wedding will be ruined if our parents aren’t there and it will be my fault. This is all so upsetting that&lt;em&gt; I’m &lt;/em&gt;considering not attending the wedding. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3i2000j3b79i20elhio@published"&gt;Of course your parents should be at your sister’s wedding. But it is up to them—not you!—to figure out what to do with their dogs.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3k5000k3b79pnien8uh@published"&gt;As someone with a sensitive dog who can’t really be boarded, I sympathize with the hassle (to a point). There are plenty of good pet sitters out there—your parents can search for reputable local pet sitting businesses, ask their friends for recommendations, or try Rover.com. Pet-friendly hotels and Airbnbs also exist. And if your sister and her fiance were willing to let your husband stay at their place, they should also be willing to host your parents, if need be.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3mj000l3b79g0uoot63@published"&gt;Your family should be able to understand that you don’t want to see your husband displaced from his home, only to return and possibly have a serious allergic reaction to lingering pet dander. I think you’ve already done about all you can to explain this to them. Let them know that as far as you’re concerned, the conversation is over; if they try to pull you back into it, don’t engage. Your parents’ dogs are not your responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnm3ok000m3b792cldk8jt@published"&gt;As for whether to attend your sister’s wedding, only you can make that call. If you don’t go, it could lead to a larger and more lasting rift in the family, which they might also blame you for. But they’re already blaming you for the current drama—&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you mentioned that your mother has never liked your husband—so maybe those are consequences you can live with.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpnikyc000lczj81szwnbvv@published"&gt;My husband and I frequently disagree about treating our daughter’s various childhood ailments. He immediately rushes to our pediatrician for antibiotics and sees nothing wrong with daily over-the-counter allergy medicine as a preventative, even when she’s not symptomatic. I tend towards a wait-and-see approach with minimal medical intervention. While I am not into the essential oil craze of my peers, I prefer healthy foods, saline nose sprays, teas, and other methods of easing common ear/nose/throat symptoms, with a doctor called in only for severe or prolonged symptoms. The kicker is that my husband is the stay-at-home parent and usually makes the medical decisions. I would prefer our daughter not become antibiotic-resistant because of overuse. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2018/08/parenting-advice-on-disagreements-about-health-care-for-kids.html"&gt;How can we resolve our different approaches to our child’s health?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any kind of exercise is good for your health, from simple things such walking—which is also &lt;a href="https://mymodernmet.com/walking-nature-reduce-negative-feelings/"&gt;great for your mental health&lt;/a&gt;—to more specialized activities such as powerlifting. But if you usually suffer from poor sleep, scientists seem to have found a great antidote for it in one particular type of workout. And while they all are likely to help as they tire you out, one excels at helping you rest, according to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41105-025-00596-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the Harbin Sport University in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-1 ai-viewport-2 ai-insert-4-17585525" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-4-17585525" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desktop-blog-ad desktop-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists looked at 30 randomized controlled trials from a dozen countries. The data featured 2,500 participants of all ages, all of them with some kind of sleep issue. The test subjects reported their experience with different activities, such as resistance training, aerobics, or traditional Chinese exercises, like &lt;em&gt;qi gong&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tai chi&lt;/em&gt;. However, one offered the best results overall—high-intensity yoga. The best part? All it required was practicing it for less than 30 minutes twice a week, with results becoming noticeable after about eight to 10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While an interesting find, the team knows there are a lot of fine details to this discovery. “Reasonable exercise intervention can effectively improve sleep disorders, but the best combination of exercise prescription variables is not yet clear,” write the researchers. “Further, high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings due to the limited studies included.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If yoga is not your thing, a &lt;a href="https://fmch.bmj.com/content/13/1/e003056" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, points to resistance and strength training as the most effective to help you sleep, as they found it can improve participants’ sleep by 35% more than aerobic exercise. However, keeping healthy sleep habits seemed to be better at ensuring a good rest rather than the exercise itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists also recommend paying attention at the timing of your exercise. For example, aerobic exercise causes the body to release endorphins, which can put your brain in an active mode that may keep you awake. That’s why you should exercise at least one to two hours before going to bed, to give your body time to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have solid evidence that exercise does, in fact, help you fall asleep more quickly and improves sleep quality,” Dr. Charlene Gamaldo &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/exercising-for-better-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Johns Hopkins Medicine. “But there’s still some debate as to what time of day you should exercise. I encourage people to listen to their bodies to see how well they sleep in response to when they work out.”

On Tuesday, the first two patients to recover were discharged, the WHO chief revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever that was first discovered in Africa in the 1970s.

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;However, data to validate those findings in a larger study group has been lacking because nicotinamide can be purchased over the counter without being entered into patients' medical records. In a new study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2838591" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Sept. 17 in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Dermatology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers found a way to get that data by analyzing records from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicotinamide is on the VA's official formulary, so the researchers checked the outcomes of 33,833 patients for their next skin &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; diagnosis following baseline &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/treatment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; with 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice daily for longer than 30 days. They looked for occurrences of basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared 12,287 patients who received the treatment with 21,479 who did not. Overall, there was a 14% reduction in skin cancer risk. When nicotinamide was taken after a first skin cancer, the risk reduction rose to 54%, but the benefit declined with treatment initiation following subsequent skin cancers. The risk reduction was much larger for squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are no guidelines for when to start treatment with nicotinamide for skin cancer prevention in the general population. These results would really shift our practice from starting it once patients have developed numerous skin cancers to starting it earlier. We still need to do a better job of identifying who will actually benefit, as roughly only half of patients will develop multiple skin cancers," said the study's corresponding author, Lee Wheless, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Dermatology and Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a staff physician at VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to ascertain the outcomes of 1,334 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patients&lt;/a&gt; who were immunocompromised due to having received solid organ transplants. Among solid organ transplant recipients, no overall significant risk reduction was observed, although early &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nicotinamide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nicotinamide&lt;/a&gt; use was associated with reduced occurrences of cutaneous squamous cell &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/carcinoma/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Fewer Americans say they &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/693362/drinking-rate-new-low-alcohol-concerns-surge.aspx"&gt;drink alcohol&lt;/a&gt; now than they have done for decades, but for those that do, the habit appears to have become dramatically deadlier over time, with the alcohol-related death rate in the U.S. almost doubling in the last twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles examined data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find that the rate of alcohol-related death increased between 1999 and 2024, with an especially sharp uptick during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. And while such deaths have declined since that peak, they remain markedly high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings emphasize the urgent need for targeted policies to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and improve access to treatment,” the authors write in a paper &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0004623"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in PLOS Global Health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A shocking rise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new findings jibe with past studies that also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alcohol-is-killing-more-americans-than-ever-1840862638"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; alcohol-related deaths in America have been climbing for decades. But it remained unclear as to the specific kinds of deaths caused by alcohol, or whether the increase in deadly drinking seen during the pandemic has been sustained.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To try and tease apart the answers to those questions, the researchers analyzed mortality data from the CDC across 14 causes of death induced by alcohol use. These included alcoholic liver disease, several forms of alcohol poisoning, as well as mental and behavioral conditions caused by alcohol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, the rate of alcohol-related deaths rose 89% between 1999 and 2024, the researchers found. The single deadliest year during this period was 2021, which saw 54,258 reported deaths that year. By 2024, deaths had begun to level off, but the average alcohol-induced death rate was still 25% higher than it was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Trends in deadly drinking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings also offer more clarity on who is dying from alcohol misuse, and why, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The majority of alcohol-related deaths were caused by alcoholic liver disease, followed by mental and behavioral conditions caused by alcohol. Interestingly, the rate of alcohol poisoning deaths remained low throughout the study period, indicating that acute overdoses are relatively uncommon compared to chronic and heavy alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alcohol-related deaths have historically been more common among men, but the researchers’ findings suggest that may be changing: They found that the single largest increase in the death rate of any demographic during the study period was among women aged 25–34, followed by men in the same age group. American Indian and Alaskan Native populations were also found to be at particular risk.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The rapid rise of alcohol-induced deaths among women is particularly concerning. Although men still die at higher rates, the gender gap appears to be closing,” said senior study author Maria R. D’Orsogna, an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Computational Medicine at UCLA, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-analysis-alcohol-deaths.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Notably, for the population aged 25–34, the male-to-female mortality ratio has decreased from three-to-one in 1999 to two-to-one in 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that they looked at deaths most directly tied to alcohol use, so their findings likely do not capture the full toll of alcohol on Americans’ health. Alcohol is known to raise the risk or worsen myriad chronic health conditions, including certain cancers. And other research has &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics-z/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-related-emergencies-and-deaths-united-states#:~:text=The%20Alcohol%2DRelated%20Disease%20Impact,States%2C%20behind%20tobacco%2C%20poor%20diet"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that more than 178,000 deaths in the U.S. linked to excessive alcohol use occur every year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done to figure out how best to prevent these deaths, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The rise in alcohol-induced mortality and its heterogeneous trends across demographics highlight the need for a better understanding of the socioeconomic factors linked to excessive alcohol consumption and of targeted prevention and treatment efforts, particularly for males, youth, and the [American Indian/Alaska Native] population,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

            As a group of advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/health/five-things-to-watch-acip-cdc-vaccine-meeting"&gt;meets to make recommendations&lt;/a&gt; on who should get the updated Covid-19 shot this season, a newly published analysis from dozens of researchers emphasizes the “substantial” benefits of broad vaccine recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00043b6nta9lb2us@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration has already made significant changes to this season’s shots: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/27/health/covid-vaccines-fda"&gt;limiting approval&lt;/a&gt; to adults 65 and older, and younger people who are at higher risk from Covid-19. The forthcoming vote from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, carries additional implications for vaccine access – and there are signs that the group could restrict access even further.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00053b6nrj9xrwiu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But scientific projection models from nine teams of researchers, summarized in a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.32469&amp;amp;utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2025.32469" target="_blank"&gt;study published Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Network Open, show that sticking to a universal Covid-19 vaccine recommendation – as has been in place in the US in recent years – has the potential to save thousands more lives than limiting the recommendation to high-risk groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00063b6ng3s36xhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While focusing on vaccination among individuals at the highest risk for severe outcomes, including those aged 65 and older and those with comorbidities, remains an effective ongoing strategy, our scenario projections demonstrate that maintaining the recommendation for all individuals to receive reformulated vaccines has the potential to save thousands more lives through both direct and indirect effects,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00073b6nfdz5js66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past five years, the &lt;a href="https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub&lt;/a&gt; has provided nearly 20 rounds of projections estimating Covid-19 disease burden. Various teams build their models with a unique set of assumptions, which are then combined into ensemble projections for six scenarios based on different vaccine recommendations and viral immune escape — vulnerability to things like a new variant or waning immunity from prior infection or vaccination. The group’s work was used to guide the expansion of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00215-0/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;primary COVID-19 vaccine schedule to school-age children&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7129e1.htm?s_cid=mm7129e1_w" target="_blank"&gt;booster recommendations&lt;/a&gt; in fall 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00083b6nilxhkhn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Models for last season – covering the period from April 2024 to April 2025 – included a worst-case scenario where there was no vaccine recommendation and high immune escape, and a best-case scenario where there was a universal vaccine recommendation and low immune escape.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00093b6nna8o32ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scenario that the researchers say was most similar to the way last season actually played out involved high immune escape. The universal vaccine recommendation that was in place in this scenario was projected to reduce hospitalizations by 11% and deaths by 13% – essentially averting 104,000 hospitalizations and 9,000 deaths.

            If vaccine recommendations had been limited to high-risk individuals, the benefit of the vaccine would still be substantial: an 8% reduction in hospitalizations and 10% reduction in deaths. But the expanded recommendations for all ages was projected to prevent an additional 28,000 hospitalizations and 2,000 deaths, the study showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Adults ages 65 and older benefit the most under all vaccine scenarios, both directly and indirectly. A universal vaccine recommendation would reduce the burden of Covid-19 on seniors by an additional 3 to 4%, averting about 11,000 hospitalizations  and 1,000 deaths in this group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This finding suggests substantial indirect benefits of universal vaccination and the continued value of broad vaccine recommendations,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The projections for last season were first published by the Scenario Modeling Hub in June 2024, to help inform decision-making ahead of last year’s ACIP meeting. Actual epidemiological trends differed from assumptions that were made in the models at that time – burden was greater than expected during the summer and less in the winter – but projected deaths aligned closely with the models, creating confidence in the “robust accuracy” of the models among the researchers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Projections for &lt;a href="https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/" target="_blank"&gt;this season&lt;/a&gt;, published by the US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub in June, paint a similar picture to last season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Recommending updated Covid-19 vaccines only for high-risk individuals will help to avoid an estimated 90,000 hospitalizations and 7,000 deaths – but broadening the recommendation for all people in the US would save an additional 1,000 lives and prevent an additional 26,000 hospitalizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We expect continued substantial burden of disease from COVID-19 in the US,” the researchers wrote in an executive summary of the findings. “All vaccination strategies are projected to significantly reduce disease burden. The greatest benefits will be seen if vaccines are offered to all ages.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            All work by the US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub is public and “available for consideration” by ACIP and other experts, said Dr. Justin Lessler, a leader with the modeling hub and professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfphv52n00023b6n5uslhzsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The modeling work was not presented at ACIP’s June meeting this year and there’s “no indication” that it will presented at this week’s meeting, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpi2uif00053b6niie22wzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We continue to share our results with the CDC and are working to make them more easily available to a broader range of organizations who are providing vaccine guidance,” Lessler said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

These included emotional eating, where a person&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14043751/food-beverages-voters-stress-eat-drink-2024-presidential-election.html"&gt; eats in response to negative emotions&lt;/a&gt;; external eating, or eating because a food looks good rather than hunger; and restrained eating, or controlling diet to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-bbce0c50-93fc-11f0-984f-75cae465fdc7"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that all participants experienced weight loss and drops in vital health markers like cholesterol and A1C, which measures the amount of glucose in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants also initially were less likely to emotionally eat. But after a year, emotional eaters generally went back to their old behaviors, hampering their weight loss progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;External eaters, however, continued cutting back on the practice throughout the experiment, suggesting Ozempic and similar drugs may be more beneficial for external eaters than emotional eaters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers are unsure exactly why emotional eaters were more likely to rebound, but they suggested it may be because their behavior is rooted in deeper psychological issues like depression and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in Japan found that people who tend to 'emotionally eat' benefitted less from GLP-1 medications like Ozempic (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Daisuke Yabe, senior study author and professor of medicine at Kyoto University in Japan, said:  'Pre-treatment assessment of eating behavior patterns may help predict who will benefit most from GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective for individuals who experience weight gain or elevated blood glucose levels due to overeating triggered by external stimuli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, their effectiveness is less expected in cases where emotional eating is the primary cause.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as one in eight US adults has reported taking Ozempic or similar medications at least once for diabetes or weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/4/1744#:~:text=5.,prevention%20and%20chronic%20disease%20prevention."&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; estimates about one in five Americans reports emotionally eating 'often or very often' due to stress or other negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/clinical-diabetes-and-healthcare/articles/10.3389/fcdhc.2025.1638681/full"&gt;Frontiers in Clinical Diabetes and Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 92 Japanese adults who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age was 58, and just over half of participants were men. They had lived with type 2 diabetes for an average of 12 years, and their average body mass index (BMI) was 30, which is considered obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 40 percent were given oral semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, while 32 received the injectable form of the drug.

But by the 12-month mark, restrained and emotional eating behaviors returned to their baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;External eating, however, continued to decrease over the year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests people who tended to practice emotional eating were more likely to return to the unhealthy habit than those who practice external eating, resulting in less weight loss over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Takehiro Kato, second study author and professor at Gifu University in Japan, said: 'One possible explanation is that emotional eating is more strongly influenced by psychological factors which may not be directly addressed by GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Individuals with prominent emotional eating tendencies may require additional behavioral or psychological support.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including the small sample size.

Respiratory virus season is coming. Policy changes based on misinterpreted data will have immediate, real-world consequences. Frankly, even if the votes end up in favor of these vaccines, so much damage is being done through these public shows of vaccine skepticism and anti-vaccine rhetoric.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Thursday and Friday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) plans to vote on three shots – the measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine; the hepatitis B vaccine given at birth; and Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The upcoming votes threaten parental choice,” Steier said. “Without ACIP recommendations, insurance may not cover vaccines. The Vaccines for Children program could stop providing them. Families who want to protect their children may lose that option.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The former top official in charge of vaccination at the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542405/rfk-jr-acip-vaccine-advisory-panel-vote-delay-hepatitis-b-shot-in-infants" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the hepatitis B vaccine recommendation, for example, may be pushed from birth to four years of age, which could mean the virus, which has dropped by 99% among young people, begins spreading in greater numbers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The committee may also &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/16/vaccine-recommendations-anti-vax-data" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;further narrow&lt;/a&gt; Covid vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We’re expecting them to present unverified VAERS reports as if they’re confirmed vaccine deaths,” Steier said, comparing that tactic to “treating every 911 call as proof of a crime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Several new members have a history of opposing vaccines, especially Covid vaccines and precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Remember, the Lord Jesus did not fear lepers, and leprosy was (and continues to be) a highly contagious infectious disease,” Catherine Stein, a professor in the department of population and quantitative health sciences at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220601043817/https://www.allinohio.com/an-epidemiologists-perspective-on-covid-19-the-other-side/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021. “Not only did He heal them, but He touched them. He showed no fear, nor did He ‘socially distance’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stein wrote that she was motivated by her religious ideology to reject precautions like wearing face masks, which she said function as a “symbol of fear” while also harming the wearer’s health, which is not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She argued that “as Christians, we should not fear death”. She also claimed that “this virus is not the scary killer the media and government portray it to be”, even in the midst of deadly waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In her off-work hours, Stein has &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20484834-stein-hb-624-testimony" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;worked&lt;/a&gt; as a researcher for Health Freedom Ohio, an antivax group &lt;a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/02/22/shes-a-public-health-professor-by-day-a-covid-19-truther-by-night/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;aligned&lt;/a&gt; with Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization previously helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is now head of HHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In February 2020, she signed on to a &lt;a href="https://freedomofconscience.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRF-Roundtable-Protecting-Religious-Freedom.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; urging Trump to reexamine school and daycare vaccine mandates and to focus on “ending the persecution of the unvaccinated people of faith”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kirk Milhoan is a pediatric cardiologist who has advocated against Covid vaccines because of the extremely rare possibility of myocarditis, or swelling of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We should stop it and test it more before we move forward,” Milhoan &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; KFF Health News in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Milhoan is a senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance, formerly known as the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance, which has promoted ineffective and often unsafe ivermectin treatments for Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Hawaii medical board filed complaints and &lt;a href="https://www.mauinews.com/news/local-news/2022/04/doctors-cleared-of-covid-19-misinformation-allegations/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;challenged&lt;/a&gt; his medical license, though his license was ultimately upheld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Evelyn Griffin, once an obstetrician/gynecologist who &lt;a href="https://x.com/EvelynGriffinM1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;shifted&lt;/a&gt; to “holistic health”, implied at a “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/centralcitynews.us/videos/3843797775903484/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Louisiana health freedom day&lt;/a&gt;” event in May 2024 that vaccines are unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When the [Covid] vaccine came out, they blindly believed that the vaccine had no harm,” she said of other doctors. “In medical school, we were taught the childhood vaccines – we were taught that they were harmless, and we were taught to just memorize the schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Griffin participated in a “Stop Vax Passports” &lt;a href="https://stopvaxpassports.org/webinar-covid-injections-and-women-miscarriage-infertility-and-more/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt;, speaking about her personal experience “treating post-injection women” and “defeating vaccine mandates for children in Louisiana.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hillary Blackburn, the daughter-in-law of Sen. Marsha Blackburn, is a pharmacist who recently &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7b57KtuzDf/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; vaccines may cause autoimmune issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Raymond Pollak is a transplant surgeon about whom little is known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new advisers will join eight others chosen by Kennedy in June after he fired the previous 17 advisers in an unprecedented move. A group called the Evidence Collective documented more than &lt;a href="https://www.evicollective.org/tec-briefs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;50 falsehoods&lt;/a&gt; from the first meeting of the new ACIP group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The vaccine committee may have up to 19 members, which means there are still six potential spots to be filled. Usually, the vetting and training process for new advisers takes months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 15:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1idzBiTlJpZ2pYd25LY0VuOUdnSDNYN1ctajVDZkpzUnVpVkhIXzQwWTZfdldIWUdjU0pzbUZXVmhLMzZlNndpNkgyTzViTFVrN3RXZGh3djVuRHJiVlRKS1ViUGpfZUxYOGlDN210TGptb1lyclMteQ</guid></item><item><title>在过去的12个月中，美国有6人死于狂犬病。须知事项- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/health/rabies-animal-vaccine-disease-health-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            While human cases of rabies in the United States are rare, it’s still a deadly disease: six people have died from rabies nationwide since September 2024, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson confirmed to CNN. In addition, the CDC is tracking 14 potential outbreaks in 20 states,
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0w79u00013b6n24jvpvix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What is rabies? How is it transmitted and by which animals? What are the symptoms of infection in humans, and is there a vaccine? How should rabies exposure be treated? And what can people do to reduce their risk of exposure?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0w79u00023b6nj76mna0q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0w38y00003b6nsorm7l7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What is rabies, and how is it transmitted?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00073b6nafmcn7j6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Rabies is caused by a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351821" target="_blank"&gt;deadly virus&lt;/a&gt; that is spread mainly through the saliva of infected animals. The rabies virus is part of the Rhabdoviridae family and genus Lyssavirus, which comprises 16 virus species. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;All 16&lt;/a&gt; can cause rabies disease in humans, though the rabies virus is by far the most common cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00083b6nw3gngx37@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This virus is typically transmitted through an animal bite, though scratches or &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;direct contact&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23930-mucosa" target="_blank"&gt;mucosa&lt;/a&gt; can also spread the virus. For instance, if the saliva of the infected animal comes in contact with a human’s eyes, mouth or open wounds, the virus could be spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00093b6no90dkcc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus primarily affects the central nervous system, with inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;incubation period&lt;/a&gt;, the time between exposure to the virus and symptom onset, may last weeks to months. Once a person starts showing symptoms of rabies, the disease is nearly always fatal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Dogs are responsible for the majority of human rabies deaths worldwide, and young children are frequent victims, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. In the United States, where rabid dogs are far less common due to effective rabies prevention programs, contact with infected bats is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html#:~:text=Nearly%20three%20in%20four%20Americans,States%20were%20infected%20by%20bats." target="_blank"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of human rabies deaths. Rabies can be found in many other wildlife species, including raccoons, skunks, coyotes and foxes. According to the CDC, around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;4,000&lt;/a&gt; animal rabies cases are reported every year, with 90% occurring in wildlife.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000c3b6n5ug26anx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; During the incubation period, there are typically no symptoms. Weeks to months after exposure, an infected person may experience &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that can include fever, headache and overall body aches. Discomfort, such as a prickling sensation, at the site of the bite is also possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000e3b6ndrrfnljc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms quickly progress. Within two weeks, the infected person starts having increasingly severe symptoms such as confusion, agitation, hallucinations and aggressive behavior. A classic symptom is hydrophobia, or fear of water: Despite feeling very thirsty, the individual may seem to panic at the sight of fluids. The person may also produce a lot of saliva and appear agitated, thrashing arms and legs. Death occurs not long after.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; According to the CDC, someone traveling to areas where rabid dogs are a problem is at a higher risk of contracting the rabies virus, as are people who may encounter animals through work or leisure activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000h3b6nbq8kcmi9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;helpful website&lt;/a&gt; that lists rabies status by country. Information includes the prevalence of rabies, whether a robust surveillance and prevention program is in place, and whether treatment is readily available if exposure occurs. WHO also has a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;useful website&lt;/a&gt; documenting areas with recent cases of human rabies. Annually, an estimated 60,000 people die from rabies worldwide; &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/rabies#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;95%&lt;/a&gt; of these fatalities occur in Africa and Asia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000i3b6njqhp26f4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are visiting a country with a higher rabies risk, consider taking extra precautions, especially if it will be difficult to access rabies treatment if you are exposed to the virus. Veterinarians, veterinary technicians, animal control officers, wildlife workers, laboratory workers who handle live rabies virus and people in similar professions should also consider prophylaxis. The same goes for people planning to hike in remote areas with dog-transmitted rabies or to explore caves in regions where rabid bats have been.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000j3b6nwlhgiynk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000k3b6n3lt9746x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Someone at high risk of being exposed to rabies can get the rabies vaccine as part of what’s called pre-exposure prophylaxis — that is, vaccination before any exposure occurs — to provide protection in case contact with the virus happens later. In these cases, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/pre-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; two doses of the vaccine spaced seven days apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000l3b6n8wqau4mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Depending on an individual’s risk exposure, the CDC recommends taking additional precautions. People in Risk Category 1, the highest risk, should have their blood checked for antibody titers six months after the second dose of the vaccine to make sure they are optimally protected. This category includes lab workers in contact with live or concentrated virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfolvd2p000a3b6nmxykdihk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People in Risk Category 2, which includes those who frequently handle bats or dead animals, should have their antibody titers checked every two years. Most veterinarians, technicians, wildlife workers and animal control officers are considered Risk Category 3: They can either opt for a one-time antibody titer check between one to three years after the two-dose vaccination or receive a one-time booster.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000m3b6ngy4yrvfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the general US population, however, the rabies vaccine is not recommended as pre-exposure prophylaxis. The vaccine is essential, though, as part of post-exposure prophylaxis, the therapies given to someone after a possible rabies exposure to prevent the disease from developing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000n3b6nhzb2whca@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The clearest example is someone who has been bitten by a wild dog, bat, fox, raccoon or other animal known to carry rabies. If someone had direct contact with a bat — for instance, waking up to find a bat in the room — this is also considered a possible exposure &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/diagnosis/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;unless a bite or scratch&lt;/a&gt; can be definitively ruled out. If possible, contain the animal so it can be observed and tested, but do not attempt to capture it if that may result in additional exposure. If you find a dead bat, do not throw it away. Do not touch it or allow other people or pets to touch it. Instead, call animal control so that the bat can be tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000p3b6ntzx1l1vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are not sure whether a possible exposure warrants treatment, it is always best to contact a health care provider. Your local or state health department can also help evaluate whether you need rabies-related care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; If you suspect rabies exposure, seek medical care right away. First, contact your primary care physician, who will generally refer you to the hospital emergency department for the first part of the treatment. Some urgent care centers may also administer the treatment. If you do not have a primary care physician, go directly to the emergency department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000s3b6nfy45w35g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have a wound, it will be washed thoroughly with soap and water immediately. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html#:~:text=Post%2Dexposure%20prophylaxis%20recommendations&amp;amp;text=A%20dose%20of%20human%20rabies,14%20after%20the%20first%20dose." target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, what will happen next depends on whether you have ever been vaccinated against rabies. If you have never been vaccinated against rabies, you will be given both the human rabies immunoglobulin and a rabies vaccine. You will then need three more doses of the vaccine, on Days 3, 7 and 14 (Day 0 being the day you received the first dose). People with immune disorders would receive a fifth dose on Day 28.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000t3b6neqxkxak8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have been vaccinated against rabies, you would not receive the immunoglobulin. However, you would still need two doses of the vaccine, one given on the initial day and one three days later.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep your pets up-to-date on their &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;rabies vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Stay away from wildlife and stray animals, and make sure your pets do as well. Also teach children not to handle or approach unfamiliar animals. If you see a wild animal such as a fox or raccoon behaving unusually, do not get close, and contact animal control instead. In addition, try to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/bats.html" target="_blank"&gt;prevent bats&lt;/a&gt; from getting inside your home through windows, chimneys or other holes. Most importantly, if you, a family member or a pet is potentially exposed to rabies, seek medical care immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voluntary Coalition includes Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York State, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and New York City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional Partnership Brings Together Public Health Agencies and Leaders to Share Expertise, Improve Coordination, and Promote and Protect Evidence-Based Public Health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work Groups Created to Identify Opportunities for Collaboration Including Public Health Emergency Preparedness, Vaccine Recommendations, Data Collection, Infectious Disease Management and Laboratory Services&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 18, 2025 —&lt;/strong&gt; Several Northeastern states and America’s largest city have been collaborating since early 2025 and today formally announced the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, a voluntary regional coalition of public health agencies and leaders, brought together to share expertise, improve coordination, enhance capacity, strengthen regional readiness, and promote and protect evidence-based public health.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;The Collaborative’s shared purpose is to work together in new ways – optimizing the use of shared resources, innovating and reimagining core services – to ensure trust in public health, respond to public health threats, advance community health and strengthen confidence in vaccines and science-based medicine.  The group’s shared goal is to protect the health, safety and well-being of all residents by providing information based on science, data, and evidence, while working to ensure equitable access to vaccines, medications and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional partnership, which was informally established several months ago, held its first in-person meeting in Rhode Island in August. The Collaborative has already formed interjurisdictional working groups to identify opportunities for collaboration and shared planning across multiple public health disciplines including public health emergency preparedness and response, vaccine recommendations and purchasing, data collection and analysis, infectious disease, epidemiology and laboratory capacity and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Collaborative worked together on science-based guidance for health care personnel (HCP) advising on precautions health care workers should take to protect themselves and patients during respiratory virus season. Other examples of collaborative efforts include sharing information on public health emergency preparedness related to three FIFA (International Federation of Association Football) World Cup host cities within the collaborative, exploring workforce pipeline activities given the understaffing in public health and coordinating state lab related activities and services.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecticut Department of Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, said, “In public health, we are always stronger together. Pathogens know no borders. Particularly in the northeast, people cross borders daily for work and school. In a time of significant change in public health, we have benefited from the enhanced collaborations between our jurisdictions. We are confident that we will preserve and protect core public health principles and services as we navigate current changes together.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maine CDC Director, Dr. Puthiery Va&lt;/strong&gt; said, “The people of Maine are known for their resilience, neighborly support, and a collaborative approach to solving community challenges. This spirit is evident in the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, which serves as an incubator for solutions in public health. By working together, we can build more adaptable, sustainable, and resilient public health framework for the region.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Health Robbie Goldstein, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, said, “When our states speak in concert, our voice carries farther, and our impact deepens. Those who work in public health are entrusted with a profound responsibility – a promise – to protect the health and safety of those in our states, to advance equity, and to ground every decision in data and evidence. Strong public health must stand high above ideology. Our region understands this, and we are moving forward, resolute, united, and guided by science.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Jersey Acting Health Commissioner Jeff Brown&lt;/strong&gt; said, “The interconnectedness of our populations and shared health challenges across the Northeast make this Collaborative a natural synergy and extension of our longstanding partnerships with peer health agencies to support the health of the people of New Jersey. Public health requires regular sharing of information, ideas, and best practices across jurisdictions and state lines. Whether it’s responding to a pandemic or an outbreak or preparing for a large-scale event such as the upcoming FIFA World Cup, with three host cities in the Northeast, working together helps keep our residents safe and healthy. We look forward to continuing to do so with our colleagues in the Collaborative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald, M.D., M.P.H.&lt;/strong&gt;, said, “Everyone benefits when we work together.  I am excited about this collaborative; we all share the same goal of achieving health and well-being for our people. New York is proud to be part of the Northeast Public Health Collaborative. By working together, we are creating a more adaptable, sustainable and resilient public health system for our state and the region.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Dr. Debra Bogen&lt;/strong&gt; said, “Protecting public health has always been a collaborative effort. Continuing to work with public health experts in other states allows the exchange of best practices, pursuit of efficiencies, and opportunities for collaboration to better meet the needs of Pennsylvanians.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhode Island Department of Health Director Jerry Larkin, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, said, “Collaboration is the core of public health. We look forward to continuing to work with the Northeast Public Health Collaborative to improve information sharing, coordinate on public health initiatives, and develop policy that is grounded in science and data. This partnership will advance our work to prevent disease and promote the health and safety of the people in every community in Rhode Island.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York City Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse&lt;/strong&gt; said, "As the oldest and largest local health department in the nation, the New York City Health Department is proud to be a member of the Northeast Public Health Collaborative. We must always protect our public health infrastructure, reject misinformation, and maintain trust in science. The collaborative is working together to rebuild public trust, and provide factual information, so people can make informed decisions about their health, and continue our critical work to address health inequities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Northeast Public Health Collaborative members share common public health goals and objectives, they recognize that each state and city is independent with their own diverse populations and unique sets of laws, regulations and histories. Members may choose to participate in or adapt those specific initiatives consistent with their particular needs, values, objectives, and statutory or regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A bat in Kent County has tested positive for rabies, the health department announced Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the county’s first rabies-positive animal of 2025. Officials did not specify where in Kent County the bat was found, but they urged residents to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“During the fall, bats start looking for safe places to roost for the winter, which can sometimes lead them into homes or businesses,” stated Cathy Armstrong, communicable disease program supervisor. “If it’s unclear whether a person or pet may have had direct contact with a bat, testing the bat is the best way to rule out any risk of rabies exposure. Because bats have very small teeth, a bite may not always be obvious in situations such as when someone was sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To capture a bat, you can use a container and a piece of cardboard while wearing gloves, pants and long sleeves. You can then call the Kent County Health Department at 616.632.7228 to determine whether the bat needs to be tested. If it does, you’ll bring the bat to the animal shelter for testing and then wait for results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, you shouldn’t touch bats or other wild animals, the health department said. You’re encouraged to keep your living spaces secure and make sure your pets are fully vaccinated against rabies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statewide, 32 rabid bats have been confirmed so far this year, according to KCHD.&lt;/p&gt;

While 82% of countries achieved reductions during this period, the rate of progress has slowed significantly across most regions, with some countries even experiencing a resurgence in NCD-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NCDs are responsible for the majority of global deaths, while more than one billion people live with mental health conditions. Alarmingly, nearly 75% of deaths related to NCDs and mental health conditions occur in low- and middle-income countries, accounting for 32 million lives lost each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just a few days—on 25 September 2025—Heads of State and Government will convene in New York for the Fourth United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting (HLM4) on prevention and control of NCDs and the promotion of mental health and well-being. The meeting aims to adopt an ambitious Political Declaration to accelerate global action and investment in these critical health and development areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions are silent killers, robbing us of lives and innovation," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "We have the tools to save lives and reduce suffering. Countries like Denmark, South Korea, and Moldova are leading the way, while others stalling. Investing in the fight against NCDs isn't just smart economics—it's an urgent necessity for thriving societies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NCDs include cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma), and diabetes, among others. Mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression, are also highly prevalent across all countries and communities, affecting people of all ages and income levels. Without urgent and sustained action to tackle these, millions more lives will be lost prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Low progress, lives at risk&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the majority of countries made progress in reducing the risk of dying prematurely from an NCD between 2010 and 2019, 60% experienced a slowdown in progress compared to the previous decade. Denmark recorded the largest improvements for both sexes. Among countries in other regions, NCD mortality also declined for both sexes in China, Egypt, Nigeria, Russia, and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest gains were driven by declines in cardiovascular disease and certain cancers—such as stomach and colorectal cancers for both sexes, cervical and breast cancers for women, and lung and prostate cancers for men. In contrast, pancreatic, liver cancers and neurological conditions contributed to rising mortality in many countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solutions are affordable and cost effective&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solutions to tackle NCDs and promote mental health and well-being are both affordable and highly cost-effective. Yet, governments often face intense lobbying from powerful industries whose products contribute to disease. Tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food companies frequently attempt to block, weaken, or delay life-saving policies—ranging from health taxes to marketing restrictions aimed at protecting children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is unacceptable that commercial interests are profiting from increasing deaths and disease,” said Dr Etienne Krug, Director of WHO’s Department of Health Determinants, Promotion and Prevention. “Governments must put people before profits and ensure evidence-based policy is not derailed by corporate pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaling up implementation of WHO’s ‘Best Buys’, a set of high impact interventions including tobacco and alcohol taxation, protecting children from harmful marketing, managing hypertension, and scaling up cervical cancer screening would cost just an additional US$3 per person per year on average. The return on investment is substantial: by 2030, full implementation could save 12 million lives, prevent 28 million heart attacks and strokes, add 150 million healthy life years, and generate over US$1 trillion in economic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Political will to change the future&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upcoming Fourth UN General Assembly High-Level Meeting (HLM4) on NCDs and mental health is the most significant political opportunity of the decade to drive transformative change. With a bold Political Declaration, Heads of State and Government can not only recommit to achieving the 2030 targets but also set the vision for the next decades —charting a new course that will save lives and improve well-being for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know what works. The time to act is now. Governments that act decisively will protect and save lives, cut costs, and unlock growth. Those that delay will pay in lost lives and weaker economies,” Dr Devora Kestel, Director of WHO’s Department for NCDs and Mental Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is calling on leaders, partners, and communities to advocate for concrete actions, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;funding and implementing&lt;/strong&gt; WHO’s ‘Best Buys’, adapted to national needs;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;taxing&lt;/strong&gt; tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strengthening&lt;/strong&gt; primary health care for prevention, early detection and treatment;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;protecting&lt;/strong&gt; children from harmful marketing;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;expanding access&lt;/strong&gt; to essential medicines and technologies;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;securing financing&lt;/strong&gt; through domestic budgets, health taxes and targeted aid;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;setting bold targets&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;track progress&lt;/strong&gt; with strong accountability;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stopping industry interference&lt;/strong&gt; in health policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;HLM4 offers a unique opportunity to adopt an ambitious, action-oriented and achievable Political Declaration on NCDs and mental health—grounded in evidence, anchored in human rights, and aimed at delivering impact through and beyond 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has identified &lt;a href="/news/item/26-05-2023-more-ways--to-save-more-lives--for-less-money----world-health-assembly-adopts-more-best-buys--to-tackle-noncommunicable-diseases"&gt;29 highly effective and affordable measures called ‘Best Buys’&lt;/a&gt; that countries can put in place to prevent and manage major noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, cancers, and respiratory diseases.

    &lt;p&gt;When you lift weights, walk up a steep hill or ride a bike, your body is continuously sending sensory signals to your brain. These signals paint a picture of the physical sensation of what you’re doing. Your brain then takes these signals and filters them through your past experience, goals, expectations and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14680"&gt;current emotional state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the way your brain uses all that context to interpret this sensory information significantly influences whether you perceive something physically strenuous, such as a bike ride, as difficult and threatening or as rewarding and pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people who are new to exercise often quit because they interpret physical discomfort as a warning sign instead of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1612197X.2022.2057568"&gt;challenge that can be overcome&lt;/a&gt;. But in recent years, scientists have shown that by changing your emotional state, you can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1612197X.2022.2057568"&gt;change how you interpret physical sensations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hWuYtOAAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;oi=ao"&gt;We are two neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QFESRMsAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;oi=ao"&gt;who study&lt;/a&gt; how the brain and body respond to stress and how those reactions shape perception. Research has shown that small, well-timed challenges can help the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1113/JP287099"&gt;body and mind grow more resilient&lt;/a&gt;, while too much stress, or stress at the wrong time, can slow recovery and sap motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent experiment, we wanted to see whether it is possible, in a sense, to recalibrate how the brain interprets difficult tasks using a tiny, safe dose of physical discomfort. We found that physical stress in manageable doses – in this case, dunking your hand in ice-cold water – can make a later effort feel more doable, particularly for people who are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14680"&gt;not yet accustomed to strenuous exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/675689/original/file-20250620-56-wtcsim.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Authors Marcelo Bigliassi and Dayanne S. Antonio monitor psychophysiological and psychological data while a participant performs a cycling exercise on a stationary ergometer.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Margi Rentis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cold first, bike second&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to evaluate the concept of stress calibration, we assembled a group of 31 adult volunteers with limited prior engagement in physical activity. Our physical fitness task involved volunteers riding a stationary bike for six minutes, with the effort increasing in short stages &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/smi.70062"&gt;from easy to tough&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one visit, before getting on the bike, participants put one hand into a bucket of ice-cold water and kept it there for as long as they could – between one and three minutes. We hypothesized this physical stress would trigger a slight change in how their brains would interpret physical sensations and change their ability to tolerate physical discomfort; this was the recalibration step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other visit they just got on the bike without doing a cold-water hand dunk. To help control for variables, we mixed up the order so that some people did the cold-water dunk on the first day and others did it on the second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While riding the test bike, participants reported on a number of variables using rating scales, including how much pain they felt, how pleasant or unpleasant the effort seemed, how much energy they had, and whether they felt in control or overwhelmed. These measures allowed us to track how the volunteers were experiencing the exercise at different levels of intensity, both with and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0005-7916(94)90063-9"&gt;without the cold-water hand dunk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/675688/original/file-20250620-56-eky40x.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Participant immerses her hand in a container filled with ice water, in a test commonly used to evaluate stress tolerance and cardiovascular reactivity.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Margi Rentis&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"&gt;CC BY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first saw the results, we were amazed by how much a short stress induction could affect people’s perceptual responses during exercise. During the hardest two minutes of the cycling task, the participants who had lasted longer in the cold-water dunk actually reported less pain and more pleasure. Additionally, the participants who said they had a high tolerance for pain experienced a slightly greater sense of dominance compared to other participants as the biking intensity peaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe three effects may help explain why our participants felt the toughest minutes on the bike were less painful and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1113/JP287099"&gt;more enjoyable after the cold-water challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first effect is similar to a quick biological reset. Ice water jolts the nervous system. In response, the brain switches on its built-in pain-dimming system and sends “turn it down” signals down the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2022.105180"&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt;. For a short window, incoming pain messages are muted, so discomfort feels less intense, helping participants tolerate more pain during cycling right after the hand dunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second effect is a short stress surge. When the body feels stress, your heart rate and blood pressure jump, stress chemicals rise, and the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4584-12.2013"&gt;brain may turn pain down&lt;/a&gt; for a moment. That bump can make the first minutes of exercise feel less abrupt, almost as if you did a quick psychological warmup. As the surge fades, your system settles, allowing you to find your rhythm without the start &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI43766"&gt;feeling so shocking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third mechanism works through the brain’s interpretation of the sensations. Getting through the short burst of discomfort from the ice dunk seemed to give participants an instant sense of “I can handle this” and a feeling of accomplishment. We think this boost recalibrates how their brains interpret stress and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;From lab insight to everyday training&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, this study shows that how your brain perceives physical sensations is adjustable. A short, well-timed challenge, such as an ice-cold hand dunk, can act as a calibration mechanism, tilting the toughest moments of exercise away from pain and toward enjoyment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need an ice bucket to apply this principle to your life. The challenge could be a short uphill push before a longer run, a quick set of jump squats before starting a workout, or a short jog before a more challenging activity. These brief contrasts can prime the body and mind so the main effort feels less like a threat and more like progress. The key is to keep the challenge short, safe and within your limits, especially on days when life is already stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This finding fascinates us because it shows that neither your brain nor your body is just a passive passenger during effort. They constantly recalibrate what “hard” feels like. The effect of overcoming one small challenge can ripple forward, making the next challenge feel more doable and even rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, those small wins become reference points, proof that effort leads to recovery and growth. Layered into everyday training, they turn workouts into opportunities to practice composure, restore a sense of control and build lasting resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Yu used the data to examine how physical challenges and mental health issues reported by individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds varied depending on three factors: whether they had visited a dentist in the past year, their income level, and their age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="align-center media media__type--image media__view-mode--large"&gt;
  

        
  
      &lt;p class="media__content"&gt;
      The study found that nearly one in three young adults skipped visits to the dentist in the past year.   
      
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW73446473 BCX0 NormalTextRun" lang="EN-US"&gt;“Across all ages, people generally managed to see a doctor,” says Yu. “But those who skipped dental care most often pointed to cost and lack of insurance coverage.” She says this finding reinforces the need to address the persistent policy gap in dental coverage, especially for those not covered by employer-based insurance or public programs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW235350661 BCX0 NormalTextRun" lang="EN-US"&gt;Young adults who missed dental visits were also more likely to skip medical care, struggle with copays, rely on emergency care, and report poor mental health or memory problems. Yu found that this group of study participants were more likely to be renters, uninsured, and racially diverse—and that unstable housing added financial and emotional strain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW235350661 BCX0 NormalTextRun" lang="EN-US"&gt;The study’s age-based analysis revealed other important generational contrasts. While adults aged 66 years or older were more likely to have insurance and own a home, they also reported more disabilities. Individuals who reported difficulty walking, bathing, running errands, or concentrating were more likely to skip dental care, particularly among these older adults. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

After a month and several unsuccessful treatments, the patient started plugging his medical history into ChatGPT, &lt;a href="https://www.anncaserep.com/open-access/the-use-of-chatgpt-in-diagnosing-tularemiandash-a-case-9930.pdf"&gt;which offered a diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;: tularemia, also known as rabbit fever. The chatbot was correct, and the case was later written up in &lt;a href="https://www.anncaserep.com/open-access/the-use-of-chatgpt-in-diagnosing-tularemiandash-a-case-9930.pdf"&gt;a peer-reviewed medical study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Around the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; described a man who appeared at a hospital in the United States with signs of psychosis, paranoid that his neighbor had been poisoning him. It turns out, the patient had asked ChatGPT for alternatives to sodium chloride, or table salt. The chatbot &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260"&gt;suggested sodium bromide&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to clean pools. He’d been eating the toxic substance for three months and, once he’d stopped, required three weeks in a psychiatric unit to stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You’re probably familiar with consulting Google for a mystery ailment. You search the internet for your symptoms, sometimes find helpful advice, and sometimes get sucked into a vortex of anxiety and dread, convinced that you’ve got a rare, undiagnosed form of cancer. Now, thanks to the wonder that is generative AI, you can carry out this process in more detail. Meet Dr. ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;AI chatbots are an appealing stand-in for a human physician, especially given the ongoing doctor shortage as well as the broader barriers to accessing health care in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;ChatGPT is not a doctor in the same way that Google is not a doctor. Searching for medical information on either platform is just as likely to lead you to the wrong conclusion as it is to point toward the correct diagnosis. Unlike Google search, however, which simply points users to information, ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) invite people to have a conversation about it. They’re designed to be approachable, engaging, and always available. This makes AI chatbots an appealing stand-in for a human physician, especially given &lt;a href="/future-perfect/361620/bloomberg-johns-hopkins-free-medical-school-doctor-shortage"&gt;the ongoing doctor shortage&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="/future-perfect/391483/us-health-care-doctors-salary-medical-school"&gt;the broader barriers to accessing health care&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As the rabbit fever anecdote shows, these tools can also ingest all kinds of data and, having been trained on reams of medical journals, sometimes arrive at expert-level conclusions that doctors missed. Or it might give you really terrible medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s a difference between asking a chatbot for medical advice and talking to it about your health in general. Done right, talking to ChatGPT could lead to better conversations with your doctor and better care. Just don’t let the AI talk you into eating pool cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-right-and-wrong-ways-to-talk-to-dr-chatgpt" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The right and wrong ways to talk to Dr. ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Plenty of people are talking to ChatGPT about their health. About one in six adults in the United States say they use AI chatbots for medical advice on a monthly basis, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/"&gt;according to a 2024 KFF poll&lt;/a&gt;. A majority of them aren’t confident in the accuracy of the information the bots provide — and frankly, that level of skepticism is appropriate given the stubborn tendency for LLMs to hallucinate and the potential for bad health information to cause harm. The real challenge for the average user is knowing how to distinguish between fact and fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Honestly, I think people need to be very careful about using it for any medical purpose, especially if they don’t have the expertise around knowing what’s true and what’s not,” said &lt;a href="https://www.daneshjoulab.com/people"&gt;Dr. Roxana Daneshjou&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and AI researcher at the Stanford School of Medicine. “When it’s correct, it does a pretty good job, but when it’s incorrect, it can be pretty catastrophic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Chatbots also have a tendency to be sycophantic, or eager to please, which means they might steer you in the wrong direction if they think that’s what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The situation is precarious enough, Daneshjou added, that she encourages patients to go instead to Dr. Google, which serves up trusted sources. The search giant &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/health-info-knowledge-graph/"&gt;has been collaborating with experts from the Mayo Clinic and Harvard Medical School for a decade&lt;/a&gt; to present verified information about conditions and symptoms after the rise of something called “cyberchondria,” or health anxiety enabled by the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This condition &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB939076866193196830"&gt;is much older than Google&lt;/a&gt;, actually. People have been searching for answers to their health questions since the Usenet days of the 1980s, and by the mid-2000s, eight in 10 people &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2006/10/29/online-health-search-2006/"&gt;were using the internet&lt;/a&gt; to search for health information. Now, regardless of their reliability, chatbots are poised to receive more and more of these queries. Google even puts &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/google-ai-search"&gt;its problematic AI-generated results&lt;/a&gt; for medical questions above &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/im-feeling-yucky-searching-for-symptoms/"&gt;the vetted results from its symptom checker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;If you’ve got a list of things to ask your doctor about, ChatGPT could help you craft questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But if you skip the symptom checking side of things, tools like ChatGPT can be really helpful if you just want to learn more about what’s going on with your health based on what your doctor’s already told you or to gain a better understanding of their jargony notes. Chatbots are designed to be conversational, and they’re good at it. If you’ve got a list of things to ask your doctor about, ChatGPT could help you craft questions. If you’ve gotten some test results and need to make a decision with your doctor about the best next steps, you can rehearse that with a chatbot without actually asking the AI for any advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In fact, when it comes to just talking, there’s some evidence that ChatGPT is better at it. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37115527/"&gt;study from 2023&lt;/a&gt; compared real physician answers to health questions from a Reddit forum to AI-generated responses when a chatbot was prompted with the same questions. Health care professionals then evaluated all of the responses and found that the chatbot-generated ones &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/im-feeling-yucky-searching-for-symptoms/"&gt;were both higher quality and more empathetic&lt;/a&gt;. This is not the same thing as a doctor being in the same room as a patient, discussing their health. Now is a good time to point out that, on average, patients get &lt;a href="https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/publications/measuring-primary-care-exam-length-using-electronic-health-record"&gt;just 18 minutes&lt;/a&gt; with their primary care doctor on any given visit. If you go just once a year, that’s not very much time to talk to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You should be aware that, unlike your human doctor, ChatGPT is not HIPAA-compliant. Chatbots generally &lt;a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/privacy-ai-era-how-do-we-protect-our-personal-information"&gt;have very few privacy protections&lt;/a&gt;. That means you should expect any health information you upload will get stored in the AI’s memory and be used to train large language models in the future. It’s also theoretically possible that your data could end up being included in an output for someone else’s prompt. There are &lt;a href="https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/how-to-protect-your-privacy-from-chatgpt-and-other-ai-chatbots/"&gt;more private ways to use chatbots&lt;/a&gt;, but still, the hallucination problem and the potential for catastrophe exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-future-of-bot-assisted-health-care" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of bot-assisted health care&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even if you’re not using AI to figure out medical mysteries, there’s a chance your doctor is. &lt;a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/o78em1y1w4i4/T7F5sDDiUC8KJzLQXfJoy/004be7f43562d318115a294cf626be7f/ClinicianOfTheFuture_2025.pdf?utm_source=banner&amp;amp;utm_medium=dg&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cotf&amp;amp;utm_content=rpt"&gt;According to a 2025 Elsevier report&lt;/a&gt;, about half of clinicians said they’d used an AI tool for work and slightly more said these tools save them time, and one in five say they’ve used AI for a second opinion on a complex case. This doesn’t necessarily mean your doctor is asking ChatGPT to figure out what your symptoms mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Doctors have been using AI-powered tools to help with everything from diagnosing patients to taking notes since well before ChatGPT even existed. These include clinical decision support systems built specifically for doctors, which currently outperform off-the-shelf chatbots — although the chatbots &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/traditional-diagnostic-decision-support-systems-outperform-generative-ai"&gt;can actually augment the existing tools&lt;/a&gt;. A 2023 study found that doctors working with ChatGPT &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825395"&gt;performed only slightly better&lt;/a&gt; at diagnosing test cases than those working independently. Interestingly, ChatGPT alone performed the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That study &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/health/chatgpt-ai-doctors-diagnosis.html"&gt;made headlines&lt;/a&gt;, probably for the suggestion that AI chatbots are better than doctors at diagnosis. One of its co-authors, &lt;a href="https://research.bidmc.org/general-medicine/people/adam-rodman-md-mph-facp"&gt;Dr. Adam Rodman&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that this wouldn’t necessarily be the case if doctors would be more open to listening to ChatGPT rather than assuming the chatbots were wrong when the doctor disagreed with their conclusions. Sure, the AI can hallucinate, but it can also spot connections that humans may have missed. Again, look at the rabbit fever case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;“Patients need to talk to their doctors about their LLM use, and honestly, doctors should talk to their patients about &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; LLM use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The average doctor has a sense of when something is hallucinating or going off the rails,” said Rodman, a hospitalist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and instructor at Harvard Medical School. “I don’t know that the average patient necessarily does.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Nevertheless, in the near term, you shouldn’t expect to see Dr. ChatGPT making an appearance at your local clinic. You’re more likely to see AI working &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-you-say-no-to-your-doctor-using-an-ai-scribe-264701"&gt;as a scribe&lt;/a&gt;, saving your doctor time taking notes and possibly, one day, analyzing that data to help your doctor. Your doctor might use AI &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/health/ai-patient-messages-mychart.html"&gt;to help draft messages to patients&lt;/a&gt; more quickly. In the near future, as AI tools get better, it’s possible that more clinicians use AI for diagnosis and second opinions. That still doesn’t mean you should rush to ChatGPT with your urgent medical concerns. If you do, tell your doctor about how that went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Patients need to talk to their doctors about their LLM use, and honestly, doctors should talk to their patients about &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; LLM use,” said Rodman. “If we just both step kind of out of the shadow world and talk to each other, we’ll have more productive conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story was also published in the User Friendly newsletter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/pages/user-friendly-tech-newsletter-signup"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; so you don’t miss the next one!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5HU1l5dG11Z0c5a3Raak5XUnpwb2ZHVjVYQTBlS1dqb0lYT0tUOVVEZjVyemtub1hDX3RkS3U3ZnBXcGcyYUp3bnROSlktQ3V4TnZLS3U4dnpVZGxhQWEzS1k2MV82UGhoVVByeHowSVRDZ1BlMkJBRGs2U2g</guid></item><item><title>圣经STI病例飙升至危险的高水平-看看您所在地区的表现如何- The Mirror</title><link>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/biblical-sti-cases-soaring-dangerously-35924393</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="ArticleBody_article__AwrJE" data-testid="body"&gt;&lt;h1 class="HeadingOne_heading-one__mmNWJ  __className_420b4d" publication="mirror"&gt;Biblical STI cases soaring to dangerously high level - see how your area fares&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="LeadText_lead-text__wd_PA __className_b38f47" data-testid="leadtext" publication="mirror"&gt;Cases of gonorrhoea in England have doubled in just over a decade as a student return to university, experts have again warned teenagers of the risk of unprotected sex&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX ImageEmbed_image-lead__Ti3qQ" data-testid="leadimage" data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35924624"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ImageEmbed_fig-caption__qotOK"&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_camera-style__Qjeby"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_209_94274)"&gt;&lt;path opacity="0.16" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M14 4H2V10.6667C2 11.403 2.59695 12 3.33333 12H12.6667C13.403 12 14 11.403 14 10.6667V4ZM8 10C9.10457 10 10 9.10457 10 8C10 6.89543 9.10457 6 8 6C6.89543 6 6 6.89543 6 8C6 9.10457 6.89543 10 8 10Z" fill="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M2 3.33331H14V11.3333C14 12.0697 13.403 12.6666 12.6667 12.6666H3.33333C2.59695 12.6666 2 12.0697 2 11.3333V3.33331Z" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;circle cx="8" cy="8" r="2" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M11.3332 1.33331L12.6665 1.33331" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_209_94274"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-title__FSINC"&gt;Rates of STIs remain really high among young people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-credit__uNiU6"&gt;(Image: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph" publication="mirror"&gt;Students have been warned to wear condoms during Freshers Week as infections of a Biblical &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/little-known-sti-seen-24-32753617" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;STI&lt;/a&gt; remain dangerously high - and our map reveals how infections have soared where you live.

The disease is thought to be referenced several times in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament Book of Leviticus, which warns: “The man that hath an issue of seed, shall be unclean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph" publication="mirror"&gt;The Romans, Jews and Arabs all have documents referring to gonorrhoea and each society had its description of symptoms and treatment. It is recorded that Pasiphae, the wife of King Minos of Crete, used a goat’s bladder as a condom as the King’s semen was said to contain “scorpions and serpents” that killed his mistresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph" publication="mirror"&gt;The disease’s name is almost as ancient as its descriptions. It is thought to have been coined by the Roman physician Galen around 130 AD who described gonorrhoea as an “involuntary escape of semen”. Symptoms of gonorrhoea, formerly known as “the clap”, include a thick green or yellow discharge from the vagina or penis, pain when peeing and, in women, bleeding between periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph" publication="mirror"&gt;It is normally spread by having unprotected sex, or in some cases by sharing sex toys, but it can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby. If untreated, complications can include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pregnancy" target="" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and infertility in women; and scrotal swelling, urethral stricture - which can make it painful to pass urine and can lead to infection - and infertility in men. Without treatment, gonorrhoea can cause permanent blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Mirror</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 11:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOTHlMLUphakduUF94TEhhNDYzbkZNXzZYclJBSlI5ajZRWHc5UnJoa2dmNkRtZFQ4amlVdFpSbWptNXZuLWEzVkZHYkxWVFhKaTJqSm1QaHhoSE41RzhqUF90LUhPaXRTby03OC12UXQySVExOXA2SXhBZjNaWldxRS0xZkFLU014MkxjMFh30gGTAUFVX3lxTE5VelhiV0xzNDl6U0xFSGR0RmZKUFMwRkZkbURCbmtQOEFZOUhudWgxNDJvYjVIbE5vU0dEUU9iSnh1dHNXdkl1a0FpTjJRRV9NU2FWd1FObHVsQWh2dFNMc2QtaDlNVndvT09iODNLbGR4NE9kX3hDY0d3WjN2XzdManV4TzM2R3RNZjJQTGV5ak8wcw</guid></item><item><title>在RFK Jr与加工食品的斗争中，甚至酸奶也面临风险-海峡时报</title><link>https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/even-yoghurt-is-at-risk-in-rfk-jrs-fight-against-processed-food</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="storyline-wrapper default"&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;When Danone SA set out to create a high-protein yoghurt, it wanted to make sure that each spoonful was loaded with as much protein as possible while keeping sugar levels low and the texture smooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;To do that, it developed a process for its Oikos Pro brand that adjusted fermentation and temperature to avoid grittiness and separation, said Ms Susan Zaripheh, Danone’s chief research and innovation leader in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Now, the industry is working to make sure that process doesn’t get Danone’s yogurt and other products defined as ultra-processed food, in &lt;a href="/world/united-states/us-unveils-new-health-plan-avoiding-curbs-on-junk-food-pesticides?ref=inline-article" rel="noopener" class="gap-x-04 items-center inline text-primary-60 select-auto" aria-label="link" target="_blank" data-testid="custom-link"&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular inline" data-testid="paragraph-test-id"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s push&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against what he considers one of the root causes of chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“We don’t want to see a definition for ultra-processed food that demonises nutrient-dense foods like dairy products,” said Ms Roberta Wagner, senior vice-president of regulatory affairs at the International Dairy Foods Association, which is among the groups lobbying the White House and federal agencies on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Mr Kennedy said last week at a Trump administration event unveiling recommendations to improve children’s health that he wanted a federal definition and a front-of-package label for ultra-processed food by the end of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;He hasn’t targeted specific items yet, but companies are pushing back and lobbying to keep their products from getting branded as such because it would likely hurt sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The administration could also recommend eating less highly processed foods in the five-year update to federal dietary guidelines expected later in 2025. The recommendations impact numerous programmes, including school meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Just in the yoghurt aisle alone, some products could escape without a label while others could be grouped with hot dogs and cookies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;That’s a big worry for the US$2.6 trillion (S$3.3 trillion) food industry because these healthier items have been a bright spot as consumers have pulled away from packaged food and sparked trends, such as the surge in demand for high-protein options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Greek yoghurt, which has more protein than other varieties, is now in nearly 74 per cent of US households, up 2 percentage points in the last year, according to NielsenIQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Adding to the concern is that more than half of all calories consumed by Americans are considered ultra-processed by the Nova system, the most commonly used standards developed outside the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“We are focusing narrowly on nutrition,” said Mr Kennedy, who has said highly processed food is poisoning Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;In response to a request for comment for this story, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that “Americans deserve to know what’s in their food, so they can make informed choices for themselves and their families”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;So far, the administration largely hasn’t opted to unleash new regulations on the food industry, urging it to voluntarily strip out food dyes, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Crafting a definition of ultra-processed food could stretch out over years, giving big food companies time to influence the process, as they have successfully done for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Ms Rena Awada, a 43-year-old cooking blogger in Michigan, is emblematic of a shift toward healthier options. She looks for whole, unprocessed foods when she’s developing recipes or feeding her five kids. To boost protein levels, she might add Greek yogurt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;But navigating a healthy lifestyle could become a bit more complicated for Ms Awada and others in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“I do try to limit the ultra-processed foods,” Ms Awada said. Sometimes she opts for convenience, but always checks ingredient labels, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“I do like to know what I’m feeding my kids and what I’m using in my recipes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The debate over what should be considered ultra-processed food, or UPF, gets ratcheted up around foods engineered to deliver health benefits, such as higher protein or lowered sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;That could ensnare a wide range of products, including protein powder, salad dressings, whole-grain breads with preservatives to extend shelf life and plant-based meat options, like those from Beyond Meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Mr John Thomas, a 33-year-old vegan bodybuilder based in Tampa, Florida, said he views some processed options, such as textured vegetable protein, as healthier than junk food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“I view that as still a relatively healthy food,” he said. “It’s processed – but it’s not an Oreo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The Trump administration first floated the idea of defining ultra-processed food in July and a fierce lobbying fight is under way over whether a federal definition should focus on ingredients, processing or a combination. Some argue it should centre on how much a type of food is made up of beneficial nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“If you create a definition of ultra-processed food that doesn’t consider nutrient density, then you’re going to be grouping dairy products like cheese, flavoured yogurts, even flavoured milk, with things like soda and candy,” said Ms Wagner, the senior vice-president from the International Dairy Foods Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Food companies that make minimally processed foods and don’t rely on synthetic ingredients see an opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Earlier in 2025, the Food Integrity Collective, a non-profit, began the “Non-UPF Verified” pilot programme, working with packaged goods companies, including Spindrift sparkling water, to develop a standard that will establish which products get a label declaring them not ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The group, which previously launched the “Non-GMO Project” butterfly label, said it has more than 200 companies on its wait-list for verification once the standard is published this autumn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Mr Jon Silverman, a senior vice-president at Spindrift, said the company has always used real fruit in its beverages, “so this programme provides a clear way to highlight that difference for consumers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The Nova system, developed in Brazil, separates food into four buckets: unprocessed or minimally processed foods like fruits and vegetables; processed culinary ingredients such as butter or sugar; processed foods made through methods such as fermentation or canning, and finally ultra-processed foods, including hot dogs and frozen pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Former FDA commissioner David Kessler filed a petition in August urging the FDA to bypass a definition and instead effectively roll back usage of processed, refined carbohydrates in the US food supply by no longer considering them “generally regarded as safe”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;For example, his petition would target high-fructose corn syrup, flours and starches used in industrial food processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;That could be a much faster way to kick a lot of ultra-processed food out of US grocery stores than undergoing a typically years-long regulatory process that would be swayed by industry lobbying, said Mr Jerold Mande, a former senior USDA official and now the chief executive of Nourish Science, a non-profit focused on nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;In July, when the US government began considering creating a definition for processed food, it acknowledged the challenges that the food industry is worried about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“Foods considered to be ultra-processed may also include foods such as whole-grain products or yogurt, which are known to have beneficial effects on health,” US agencies said in materials released at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“It is important therefore to consider unintended consequences of an overly inclusive definition of UPFs that could discourage intake of potentially beneficial foods.” BLOOMBERG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Straits Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 11:10:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNczFBbkZZb0tiR0RQV1NGZlpObjZHVjBuekZxY0RMTGxpU2hWTXFWTXA5RFoxeUwzMXNxVzFRSk05amhySWo5Uk80UlN3VS1ubkJiTHpWd3NJUnlQQ2ttaDV5dU8yblVqekJKcWo2UVM3VnRvM2EwOVBvbTdoUDItaUJ6LW11RFdldEYxZERVN3k5bDRRZlVoWU1VMHBXa3pndXY1enhFSzFaNFRWVnJXU1FB</guid></item></channel></rss>
