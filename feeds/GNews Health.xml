 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The nutritionist explained that coughing after eating a meal can be a sign of something more serious than 'just acid reflux', increasing the risk of chronic asthma, sinus infections and even gastrointestinal cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Studies have shown that suffering acid reflux for several years can increase the risk of throat, oesophageal and thyroid cancers by &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10557881/"&gt;at least two-fold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The constant flow of stomach acid in the throat is thought to irritate the cells lining the throat which can lead to mutations that trigger the formation of cancerous tumours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have also shown that almost 28 per cent of people with laryngeal cancer suffered with acid reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Pelletier explained: 'When acid irritates your larynx [voice box], it triggers you body's natural defense: a cough reflex.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Pelletier suggested trying to avoid excessive throat clearing, which can irritate the lining of the throat further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoiding eating two to three hours before bed, reducing acidic foods and addressing stress can also alleviate symptoms and therefore the risk of cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Focus on calm, unhurried meals and chewing food well,' the expert advised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as acidic foods, like citrus fruits, vinegar and tomatoes, the dietitian also advised limiting carbonated drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of LPR include a sensation of a lump in the throat, hoarseness, frequent throat clearing, difficulty swallowing, a chronic cough and a sore dry throat &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because fizzy drinks can cause the belly muscles to swell, which puts pressure on the sphincter muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They can also increase the acidity of the stomach, increasing the risk of reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Consuming too much alcohol and coffee can also cause acid reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic, at least half of patients who complain about chronic hoarseness have LPR, or 'silent' reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acid reflux is caused by acid flowing into the oesophagus—the tube that connects the mouth and the stomach—irritating soft tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This happens when the muscular valve at the top of the stomach, which usually closes to prevent food and stomach juices escaping, doesn't work properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While typical heartburn strikes at any time of day, usually after eating, silent reflux usually occurs at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;T&lt;span&gt;he condition can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms mimic other conditions, such as chest infections and allergies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other common symptoms include feeling that too much mucus is collecting in the throat and excessive burping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors diagnose the silent condition by using a camera to look at a patient's throat and voice box, which will often be inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment usually involves making lifestyle changes—including cutting back on alcohol and quitting smoking—taking antacids to reduce stomach acid and in some cases surgery to tighten the valve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antacids such as Gaviscon and Rennie work by forming a 'raft' over the stomach contents so that if anything escapes back into the throat, it is less damaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rarer cases, patients may be referred to a gastroenterologist, particularly if doctors are concerned about the silent symptoms developing into serious health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS advises anyone who experiences symptoms that don't improve on their own for three weeks to contact their GP for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 11:23:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQWk51LVdWTVVJcmE4bEE2OGt6VUdSTHBNbi1lTmtwMmhGZk5vaGU5WkhyZUY1aXlBZlpjcDUyVXhaU1RRV3VjTm84VHZrNXRsLXlORnhfUEZCVkdSX2g0VUw5NF8yMmw0aEswMW1pOTB3dkdUVnRCMk5vbU1LOUdJNk1VOVlrSEZfXzB4TGZWTmtFekdWOTNLOHJwMNIBoAFBVV95cUxOeGdyZkhPN0JSQWxlblFGSjJWd0tCUWZDaTBDT21ibmU0SDdTdFZsM0YzNElTWndGMWI0cE94R1J1WHNzak9ZRzI2Ti10aGt6d1YzTWZheXppYlpkSlQ4dmtFUGx0WFd5Z0Jlb2w1Y2JFbEsyNXpUdkxHSHk3V2xDd0twejdfUDlOd0hHWmNyaHJCcG1tZjdpNHpLMDh2bkxa</guid></item><item><title>美国已有3个月没有出现人类禽流感病例。专家们想知道为什么- CNN | The US hasn’t seen a human bird flu case in 3 months.

            Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration’s deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?

            “We just don’t know why there haven’t been cases,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “I think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren’t being detected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00073b6mjgbiwf7i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The H5N1 bird flu &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-humans-animals-deaths-ae01d3717783f0cf41e23f3fedb97017" target="_blank"&gt;has been spreading widely&lt;/a&gt; among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00083b6m3kqx8zyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. — most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00093b6mlbnmqq7f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in &lt;a href="https://www.centralnevadahd.org/press-release/" target="_blank"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/ODH-News-Releases/ohio-reports-first-human-case-of-bird-flu-021225" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://health.wyo.gov/wyomings-first-human-bird-flu-case-confirmed/" target="_blank"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000a3b6m3656avjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation’s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000b3b6m10o7stna@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000c3b6mvhtg5jps@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural — maybe temporary — decline in cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000d3b6mzx5bomz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000e3b6muk4nhhzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" target="_blank"&gt;limited activity&lt;/a&gt; recently.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000f3b6mldvrew71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New infections are still being detected in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, but not as frequently as several months ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000g3b6mrjizlzc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Given the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it’s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,” the CDC said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000h3b6mi0uzqs18@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn’t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000i3b6mu1tz3fy5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t think that anybody’s hiding anything,” said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000j3b6m52qjrvro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Osterholm and some other experts think it’s likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000k3b6mytznh2nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government’s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000l3b6moojfl10q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000m3b6mcjmdrexp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA’s Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000n3b6mi39uhbrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said “targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000o3b6mjgel3w2y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000p3b6m5321zubp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmawd6z5d000a3b6m5o6c379q@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="cdc-says-the-risk-to-the-general-public-remains-low" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        CDC says the risk to the general public remains low
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000q3b6mqeycqzh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000r3b6mvnq30cii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pandemic-flu/php/monitoring/irat-virus-summaries.html" target="_blank"&gt;an agency assessment&lt;/a&gt; said there is a “moderate risk” that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000s3b6mgukqxmpp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, research is continuing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000t3b6mmju6dg17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas A&amp;amp;M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000u3b6mfojnnfwv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000v3b6m9sk7qag8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have had very good participation,” Douphrate said. “They have been very willing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000w3b6myc0pmgzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similar surveillance is “urgently needed” among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000x3b6msekfbi4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-dairy-farmers-barb-petersen-07bd5accb01441bc5d279464271d2371" target="_blank"&gt;the first signs&lt;/a&gt; that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000y3b6mxdiw2cw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu — or whether the virus can spill over into people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000z3b6mvrgopec6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00103b6mz5hs7tvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s easy to downplay something because that’s usually what humans do,” she said. “But what we really need to be doing is ramping up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Are any types of alcohol less risky than others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you’ve heard that &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/well/eat/red-wine-heart-health.html" title=""&gt;red wine is better for you&lt;/a&gt; than beer or liquor, or that clear liquor like vodka or gin is less harmful than dark liquor like rum or whiskey, we have bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Alcohol is alcohol,” said Jürgen Rehm, a senior scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. Drinking any type of alcohol, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/13/well/mind/alcohol-health-effects.html" title=""&gt;in any amount&lt;/a&gt;, is bad for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, experts say, it’s sometimes not reasonable or even practical for people to avoid alcohol entirely.

Within a couple of weeks, she was debilitated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her vomiting exacerbated the excruciating pain in her skull. She spent nearly every hour in bed with the covers pulled over her head, blocking out any sliver of light. Even the clock on her microwave was too much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I went from training for a marathon, raising two teenagers and having a job to essentially being bedridden,” said Carrigan, 41, of Bakersfield, California, who works for Kern County Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her condition continued to get worse and doctors couldn’t provide answers — until her third visit to the hospital, when one doctor asked her if she’d had any respiratory symptoms before the headaches started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She had. About a month before the headaches started, Carrigan had what she thought was a typical cold — though she recalled that her cough lingered a bit longer than normal and she went on to develop a rash on her thighs. Both symptoms got better without treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg" alt="Brynn Carrigan on the Zion Angels Landing Hike in Zion National Park."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Brynn Carrigan hiking Angels Landing in Zion National Park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Brynn Carrigan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These turned out to be key pieces of information. A biopsy of her spinal fluid revealed that Carrigan had coccidioidal meningitis, a rare complication of a fungal infection called Valley fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I knew something was wrong but never in a million years did I think it would be something so serious,” Carrigan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Valley fever, or coccidioidomycosis, is caused by inhaling &lt;em&gt;coccidioides&lt;/em&gt; spores, a type of fungi endemic to the hot, dry climate of the southwestern United States. Climate change is creating drier soils that are inching farther east, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/valley-fever-historically-found-only-southwest-spreading-can-devastati-rcna64313" target="_blank"&gt;expanding the range&lt;/a&gt; of the fungi. Valley fever is increasingly being diagnosed outside its usual territory and cases have been rising across the Western U.S. While Arizona still sees the highest number each year, California is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/valley-fever/php/statistics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;closing the gap&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;From 2000 through 2016, California had 1,500 to 5,500 cases a year. From 2017 through 2023, those numbers &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;jumped&lt;/a&gt; to 7,700 to 9,000 annual cases. Preliminary &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; for 2024 puts the count at more than 12,600 — the highest the state has ever seen and about 3,000 more cases than the previous record, in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Early data shows California is on track for another record-breaking year. Already, the state has &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;logged&lt;/a&gt; more than 3,000 confirmed cases of Valley fever statewide, more than there were at the same time last year and nearly double what cases were at this time in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There is no question that the number of cases of coccidioidomycosis is enormously higher than before,” said Dr. Royce Johnson, chief of the division of infectious disease and director of the Valley Fever Institute at Kern Medical in California. “If you want to see me, right now you’d have to wait until July, and that goes for my colleagues, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drought cycles driving spread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Carrigan lives in Kern County, a dry, sprawling region that sits between two mountain ranges at the southern end of California’s Central Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The county has already recorded &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;at least 900 Valley fever cases&lt;/a&gt; so far this year and has been ground zero for the fungal infection in the state for the last three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But the consistently high cases in places like Kern County are not driving the upward trend in California, said Gail Sondermeyer Cooksey, an epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Instead, new hot spots are emerging along the edges of the Central Valley — in Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties, along California’s central coast. Cases in Contra Costa County, just east of Berkeley, have &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;tripled&lt;/a&gt; so far this year compared with the same time in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It appears to be spreading out,” Sondermeyer Cooksey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many factors likely influence how well &lt;em&gt;coccidioides &lt;/em&gt;spores multiply and spread, “but one thing we have identified as a big driver of those peaks and dips is drought,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00202-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; in The Lancet Planetary Health found that drought years suppress Valley fever cases, but multiple years of drought followed by a wet winter causes cases to rebound sharply. This shift in weather patterns, which is driven by climate change, appears to largely influence where new Valley fever hot spots emerge. Longer, drier summers can also &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2024.0821" target="_blank"&gt;shift transmission season&lt;/a&gt;, when the spores spread, from late summer and early winter to earlier in the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re seeing wetter wets and drier dries across the Southwest, but California is seeing that to a higher degree,” said Jennifer Head, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, who studies Valley fever and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Arizona, new hot spots are popping up in places in the state that have a climate more similar to California’s than elsewhere in Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The highest increases in Arizona are in the northern plateau regions, which, similar to California, have historically been colder and wetter,” Head said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closely tracking Los Angeles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The climate patterns expanding Valley fever’s range in California are the same ones that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/climate-change/california-fires-weather-climate-change-rcna190892" target="_blank"&gt;drive increasingly intense wildfires&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists are still trying to understand how fires may worsen Valley fever risk, but some research has shown &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196%2823%2900046-3/fulltext#:~:text=A%20population%2Dbased%20study%20in%20California%20found%20that,the%20preceding%201%20month%20and%203%20months." target="_blank"&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt; between wildfire smoke and higher rates of diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sondermeyer Cooksey said the state health department warned first responders to January’s devastating fires in Los Angeles County of the potentially increased risk of Valley fever in the area because of the fires. There have been past &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7134a4.htm" target="_blank"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; among wildland firefighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s some limited evidence that wildfires may spread the &lt;em&gt;coccidioides&lt;/em&gt; spores. In a 2023 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10402968/#:~:text=We%20find%20limited%20evidence%20that,pre%2D%20and%20post%2Dwildfires" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers looked at 19 fires across California and observed higher rates of Valley fever following three of those fires. These fires tended to be larger, located near population centers and burned areas that had high Valley fever transmission prior to the fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not entirely clear whether there is a link between wildfires and Valley fever, but what is important to know is that &lt;em&gt;coccidioides&lt;/em&gt; live in the dirt and anything that disturbs the dirt can exacerbate Valley fever,” Sondermeyer Cooksey said. “Fires do that, then we have all of the reconstruction projects that also disturb soil.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Peak Valley fever season hasn’t happened yet this year. Because reconstruction efforts are disturbing soil in the burn scar, Sondermeyer Cooksey said state and local public health departments “are closely tracking the numbers” in areas hit by January’s fires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cases after Lightning in a Bottle festival &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Diagnosing Valley fever is tricky, mostly because its symptoms overlap with other respiratory illnesses including flu, Covid and pneumonia. If someone experiences those symptoms, it’s important for them to let their doctor know if they’ve been around disturbed soil or dust — in a construction zone, camping, hiking, working outside or at a festival — or in an area known to have Valley fever, Sondermeyer Cooksey said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms typically show up one to three weeks after exposure, but it can take as long as eight weeks, so people may not make an immediate connection, Head, of the University of Michigan, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-22.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;19 people&lt;/a&gt; who attended the Lightning in a Bottle music festival — which is being held in Kern County again this month — were diagnosed with Valley fever later in the summer. At least eight were hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Lightning in a Bottle is right in the middle of the endemic region, that’s one of the hot spots for the disease,” said Dr. George Thompson, director of the &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/valley-fever/" target="_blank"&gt;Center for Valley Fever&lt;/a&gt; at the University of California, Davis, adding that the vast majority of people who attend will not get an infection, but people who aren’t from an endemic area may be at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Thompson said it’s clear that he and his colleagues across the state are treating more patients for the infection. Only about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/post-travel-evaluation/post-travel-respiratory-infections.html" target="_blank"&gt;1% of cases&lt;/a&gt; result in life-threatening meningitis or other complications, as Carrigan’s did, but once a person is infected, they never clear the fungus from their body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There is no drug that kills cocci, so what keeps you from being ill is your immune response,” Johnson, of Kern Medical, said. To treat the infection, people are given antifungals “long enough for a person’s immune system to figure out how to control it. If you then do something to disrupt that immunity, it can start growing again, and that can surface years later,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Carrigan spent the last year on an intense regimen of anti-fungal treatments. During the first few months, she lost most of her hair and eyelashes and barely recognized herself in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She’s now made a full recovery and even ran a marathon this spring, but she still takes anti-fungal medication. Carrigan said she wants more people to understand both the &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/pages/Coccidioidomycosis.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;warning signs of Valley fever&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of telling their doctor if they’ve been somewhere with cases, which could help people get a faster diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Even if it’s only 1% of cases, as we see cases increase, the number of people who experience complications is going to rise, too,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQVDVIZ1VxSmNrVjZDVEtYcEp1RVJvUUxqR08zcVhZZEVOaHk2OHBuQWJPY0NMX3M0M1FlZEFPNTNEWjVNUzY2ZXMteGxYdDZVVm5tSk84dGt1SE1xYVRzM215ZEFPemMwOUIyTnF4ODFFbDRLSm1MU2wtTEp5dEJNNjJfMDZpa3FtMTdVOGZzWElJeUgxb1NHZVNtZi01dHM2Wm1kM3FWQ1N5U2owRWlYbUZHLVQ2QdIBVkFVX3lxTE03YTFUamZ2VDYtR2RmX0dZV2drZEhxRV9VR0FSZTlVaUdpOGQ0NjJSVDB5TjFtbWdQNnh5czBsUFBTU01Ibk1UVVNUaUk3MXM0M2d5anBn</guid></item><item><title>告别节食！这种简单的分子可以帮助您长寿！ -玻璃年鉴 | Say Goodbye to Dieting!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the United States, research focused on aging may hold the key to extending our lifespan. Scientists suggest that a specific nutritional adjustment could have positive effects on longevity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-actirise-slot="top-content" class="device-mobile device-tablet ads"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Key: Isoleucine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the scientific community has been exploring aging, but so far, &lt;strong&gt;no one has discovered a magic cure&lt;/strong&gt; to counteract the effects of time. Nowadays, many studies target the cellular level, aiming not to reverse but to adapt the body’s mechanisms to aging. One potential avenue for this adaptation is through diet, as indicated by a study published in the journal Cell Metabolism in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study, led by the University of Wisconsin at Madison (USA), flew under the radar at the time and focuses on &lt;strong&gt;isoleucine, a very special amino acid&lt;/strong&gt;. Isoleucine is classified as an “essential” amino acid, one of the twenty major amino acids encoded by the genome for protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the human body does not produce isoleucine, and it &lt;strong&gt;must be obtained through diet&lt;/strong&gt;—primarily from fish, meat, eggs, legumes, dairy products, and some nuts. Essential for proper bodily function, this amino acid aids in tissue repair, energy production, and impacts several metabolic functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Risky Modification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the American study was to test the effects of reducing isoleucine intake in mice. According to the findings, male mice experienced an &lt;strong&gt;average lifespan increase of 33%&lt;/strong&gt;, while females saw a 7% increase. Other beneficial effects noted included better regulation of blood sugar levels, an increase in muscle mass, and a reduction in the incidence of certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, there is no proof that similar results could apply to humans. It’s worth noting that our bodies are more complex than those of mice, and more importantly, &lt;strong&gt;altering the intake of an amino acid appears risky&lt;/strong&gt; as it could disrupt some biological functions undesirably. Therefore, the study’s authors do not recommend a sudden and/or uncontrolled reduction of isoleucine but instead suggest avoiding excess by choosing foods that contain it more carefully. The researchers are also considering developing a treatment to modify the biological activity of isoleucine or to modulate its absorption without making significant dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these findings are promising, &lt;strong&gt;several uncertainties remain&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, the exact mechanisms in mice need to be accurately translated to human physiology, and the optimal dose or level of isoleucine needed to increase lifespan without causing long-term issues must still be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It found people who consumed UPFs had a 22 percent higher risk of depression, a 48 percent higher risk of anxiety and a 41 percent higher risk of poor sleep - which can cause a cascade of poor health outcomes itself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And another study included found microplastics and nanoplastics induce oxidative stress on the central nervous system, which may cause cellular damage and increase the vulnerability to neurological disorders.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the authors' review of the current data, they concluded the high levels of microplastic contamination in ultra-processed foods could be why they have such detrimental impacts on health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists think ultra-processed foods damage your gut, and that can in turn damage with your brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This connection — called the gut-brain axis — means when your gut's out of whack, your mood and mental health can take a hit too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has also shown that these junk foods are full of artificial sweeteners, which may throw off the way your brain cells talk to each other and disrupt hormones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of that, microplastics in the foods could be linked to depression and anxiety, with researchers warning they might harm brain development, trigger inflammation, and disrupt sleep and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ultra-processed foods contain high concentrations of microplastics. Contamination can occur during processing and packaging of the foods - which are often in plastic wrappers and containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics are small plastic pieces that are less than 5mm in size and insoluble in water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The microplastics in UPFs could also be fueling a rise in dementia, researchers of a separate study believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study from earlier this year - that was not included in this week's article review - analyzed brain tissue from 54 autopsies and discovered every brain had microplastics in it - equivalent in mass to a plastic spoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found individuals diagnosed with dementia exhibited up to 10 times more microplastics in their brain tissue compared to those without this condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the study does not directly connect them, it does show a relationship between the accumulation of microplastics and neurological disorders. SAYS WHO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An author of that study said microplastic levels in the human brain have increased by 50 percent over the past eight years - and rates of dementia have also increased, with cases expected to nearly double by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics can cross the blood-brain barrier, a protective shield that typically prevents harmful substances from entering the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once inside, these tiny particles may trigger inflammation, disrupt neurological signaling, and potentially contribute to the development of neurological disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While scientists are still investigating the direct impact of microplastics on human health, animal studies have shown that exposure can lead to behavioral changes, memory impairment, and reduced motor coordination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another separate 2022 study found people who ate the most UPFs had a 25 percent faster rate of executive function decline and a 28 percent faster rate of overall cognitive impairment compared to people who are the least amount of processed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the high content of sugar, salt and fat in UPFs promotes harmful inflammation throughout the body, including the brain, which could harm cognition and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another neurological condition on the rise that could be tied to microplastics in UPFs is autism, which affects one in 31 kids in the US. This is a dramatic increase from one in 150 children two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have posited UPFs can negatively impact the gut microbiome, and an off-balance microbiome has often been often in children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also some evidence UPFs can alter gene expression that leads to changes in brain development and function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Processed foods can also be high in levels of heavy metals, including mercury and lead, which may contribute to or exacerbate symptoms of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no known cause of autism.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While preliminary research has been conducted on the association of microplastics and autism, scientists say there is not enough information to draw conclusions and more research needs to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To address the issue of microplastics, the authors of the most recent article proposed the Dietary microplastic Index (DMI). A system that would quantify exposure to microplastics through food consumption and assess the microplastic content and risk of accumulation based on the foods people eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Stefan Bornstein, who authored a peer-reviewed research paper on removing microplastics from the body, said: 'While we need to reduce our exposure to microplastics through better food choices and packaging alternatives, we also need research into how to remove these particles from the human body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his paper, he posits that a process called apheresis could remove microplastics from the body. This is a medical procedure that removes specific components of blood from the body - like plastics - and returns the remaining components - such as the building blocks that make up blood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Compared to other states, that puts Utah at No. 21 in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to prostate cancer deaths, Utah is well above average: 1 in 40 Utah men die from the disease. That puts Utah at No. 4 in the country for prostate cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is Utah men not getting screened as early as they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reasons for that could be Utahns' access to health care, especially in rural towns with older populations who live farther away from where they get treatment. It's part of the reason then-Vice President Biden visited the Huntsman Cancer Institute back in 2016 — to unite researchers to eliminate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reasons for that could be Utahns' access to healthcare, especially in rural towns with older populations who live farther away from where they get treatment. It's part of the reason then-Vice President Biden visited the Huntsman Cancer Institute back in 2016 — to unite researchers to eliminate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what's the solution? Johnson said men need to be screened for prostate cancer starting at age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's now a simple blood test you can take, he said. But if you have a family history of prostate cancer, you may want to get screened sooner. At a bare minimum, 50 is the age men need to start talking with doctors about screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still not sure?

Utah has been taking steps to address the vaping crisis, including implementing restrictions on flavored vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While electronic cigarettes have been marketed as a safer alternative to smoking, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ntr/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ntr/ntaf067/8079085?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; noted that's not the case. Johns Hopkins researchers looked at health data from 250,000 people over four years. The findings showed that those who used e-cigarettes had a higher risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than those who didn't smoke or use e-cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a leading cause of death worldwide and is typically irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once it's there, it's there, and really the main prevention is no tobacco, no e-cigarettes," Blagev said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the long-term effects of e-cigarettes are still being studied, vaping has been linked to cardiovascular disease, reproductive harm and neurological issues, such as strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teenagers are more susceptible to nicotine addiction than adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having this habit and these behaviors early on can have real consequences in the longer term," Blagev said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blagev emphasized the importance of parents having conversations about vaping with their kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As parents, really one of the most important things we can do is have the lines of communication open," Blagev said. "We really want to help our kids be able to make decisions and navigate these challenging situations, and be set up for success and really long-term health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 02:37:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNckU2eFdTclg0N2hkeWlhTVF5N0VLOVlHSW5yRVVuNVlHcThDUVpZNnRnUDhYLXQ5U2NWSWtIdWFfWFRDZUYwbE5ETWo4RjhGWnZoWjNKNXNqYzJJbzdId2tZUDQzRUM0QjU1TW1VVlhoMndVMC0yVm9HMEpIMmpZWTcydWVHTURlRDVfWDZPNGxMYW9PQnNUdUI4cVFwNHhHanlPOUV4Zw</guid></item><item><title>胃肠道医生故意限制自己饮食的6种流行食品和饮料- BuzzFeed | 6 Popular Foods And Beverages That GI Doctors Purposely Limit In Their Own Diets - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNRE5CX1M3VTNhVlpqaUxDNnVOVEJpbk5qY0czejd0NmNuRjJLTzJzX2x0SExfNU9janhQMHJtMWZHellUSjBLUjJvZTBmUks2b0otTFVQQloxTTNXcm9JdlJ2N0d4ZFdiakFmZDV2cHV0cVh2M2pmQ1hEVWg4Nk92b1podXZkNTVnd0lFUkk5bmdFenBvdmVWTjEydw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. &lt;a href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/1727/shilpa-grover-gastroenterology_hepatology_and_endoscopy-boston" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Shilpa Grover&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the onco-gastroenterology program in the division of gastroenterology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, refined grains aren’t great for your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies that have evaluated dietary patterns have clearly shown that a high intake of red and processed meat and refined grains is associated with an increased risk of [inflammatory pouches in the digestive tract] called diverticulitis,” she said. “Contrary to what was thought earlier, nuts, corn, and popcorn are not associated with an increase in the risk of developing diverticulosis, or complications like diverticulitis or bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But your gut health isn’t all you have to watch out for when it comes to eating a diet high in red meat and refined grains. “Those same diets recommended to decrease the risk of health conditions such as diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/coronary-artery-disease" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;coronary artery disease&lt;/a&gt; and cancer, including colorectal cancer, are also likely to decrease the risk of diverticulitis,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re mourning a loss of identity as you contemplate spending your summer months without a single hot dog, worry not: A hot dog here and there won’t destroy your gut health. Just go easy on them — and maybe add sauerkraut for some gut-boosting benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-digestion-health_l_6411d77ce4b0a3902d2e1014" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879767"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber helps minimize blood sugar spikes and is essential for diabetes management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chickpeas, chia seeds, edamame, raspberries and avocados are top high-fiber foods for diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increase fiber intake gradually to minimize digestive side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; plays a crucial role in supporting overall health, particularly for individuals with diabetes. One of its most significant benefits is its ability to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;help regulate blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;. By slowing the digestion and absorption of glucose, fiber prevents sharp spikes and crashes in blood sugar, promoting a steadier, more controlled rise. Unlike carbohydrates that are broken down into glucose for energy, fiber passes through our digestive system largely intact, helping to moderate how quickly glucose enters the bloodstream.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This makes it an essential component of managing diabetes effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, consuming whole-grain bread instead of white bread introduces additional fiber and nutrients, slowing the digestive process and leading to a more gradual increase in blood sugar. Incorporating fiber into meals doesn’t always require a complete diet overhaul—it can often be as simple as adding a high-fiber ingredient to complement your dish. With so many high-fiber foods available, it’s easy to find options that suit your preferences and dietary needs. Let’s explore some of the best high-fiber foods that can help you manage blood sugar while keeping your meals balanced and delicious.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans) are an excellent high-fiber addition to any salad, sauté or grain bowl. A &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1100434/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;½-cup serving of canned chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; contains about 117 calories, 6 grams of protein, 19 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of fat and 5 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The fiber and protein serve to slow down the digestion of the carbohydrates in the chickpeas, allowing them to raise blood sugar slowly and steadily, which is especially helpful when you have diabetes. Try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252614/classic-hummus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Classic Hummus&lt;/a&gt; for a boost of chickpeas in your diet.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a fiber powerhouse. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170554/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One tablespoon of chia seeds (1/2 oz.)&lt;/a&gt; contains about 70 calories, 2 grams of protein, 4 grams of fat and almost 5 grams of fiber in just one small spoonful!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study found that people with both type 2 diabetes and hypertension who included 40 grams of chia seeds every day for 12 weeks experienced a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure compared to those who did not add chia seeds to their diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are super universal, too. You can add them to just about anything for a boost of fiber, protein and healthy fat. Add chia seeds to oatmeal, overnight oats, toast (sweet or savory), smoothies or salads to reap the benefits. Or try a delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia seed pudding&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Edamame is an excellent protein- and fiber-filled food. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168411/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One cup of shelled edamame&lt;/a&gt; contains about 188 calories, 18 grams of protein, 13 grams of carbs and 8 grams of dietary fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The high protein and fiber content help slow down the digestion of these tasty green soybeans, making them a great addition to a diabetes-friendly eating pattern.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are so many different ways to incorporate edamame into your diet. Add ½ cup shelled edamame to any salad for a plant-based protein boost. You can boil frozen edamame for 5 minutes, drain and season with salt, and enjoy it as a high-protein snack at any time. Going out for sushi? Order the edamame as your appetizer. Starting the meal out with a high-protein, high-fiber appetizer can help you feel satisfied until your entrees arrive, and may help you enjoy your meal in more balanced portions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Raspberries are an excellent fruit option for those with diabetes. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/167755/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One cup of raspberries&lt;/a&gt; contains about 64 calories, 14 grams of carbs and 8 grams of dietary fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research suggests that red raspberry consumption is linked to improvements in glucose handling and insulin sensitivity, though more robust, human studies are needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are tons of ways to incorporate raspberries into your diet. Enjoy them raw, add them to salads, sprinkle over a parfait or combine them with chia seeds to make our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/255160/peanut-butter-chia-berry-jam-english-muffin/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia Berry Jam&lt;/a&gt;. That said, fresh raspberries can be expensive and spoil quickly, so opt for frozen ones to save some money and extend their shelf life.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocados are known for their healthy fat and omega-3 content, but don't overlook them as an excellent source of fiber, too. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/171705/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One half of an avocado&lt;/a&gt; contains almost 7 grams of fiber—that's 33% of the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;daily recommended amount&lt;/a&gt; for women and 23% for men. One half of an avocado also contains about 15 grams of unsaturated fat, which is a type of fat that has some heart-healthy benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; can help to lower LDL ("bad") cholesterol and raise HDL ("good") cholesterol to help keep your arteries free of plaque and functioning at their best. The high fat and fiber content of avocados also makes them a super-slow-digesting food. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yes, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261631/everything-bagel-avocado-toast/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avocado toast&lt;/a&gt; is delicious, but there are many other ways to enjoy all that this creamy fruit has to offer. Add mashed avocado to a sandwich in place of mayo, or add cubed avocado to a salad for more healthy fats and fiber. Have avocados that are on their way out? Peel, pit and cube them and throw them in the freezer in a zip-top bag. Add a couple of frozen avocado cubes to smoothies for healthy fat, fiber and tons of creaminess.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is a super-important nutrient to include in any eating pattern, especially if you have diabetes. But remember, increasing your fiber intake should be a slow and steady endeavor, as eating too much fiber right off the bat can lead to some unpleasant digestive symptoms. Upping your fiber intake can be as simple as a few additions of high-fiber foods like these throughout your day.

&lt;p class="block"&gt;But a growing number of patients claim Ozempic can come with a terrifying side effect: Irreversible vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Edward Fanelli, a former contractor from Freehold, New Jersey, said he was prescribed Ozempic to manage his diabetes, but within months, his vision went dark - forcing him to give up his career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"Not even six to eight months later, I, out of nowhere, I could not see out of my right eye," he says. "I couldn't take a chance do the contracting work, worried about cutting my fingers off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Fanelli says he was diagnosed with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a sudden on-set condition with no cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;He is the first patient in New Jersey to file a lawsuit in state court against the makers of Ozempic, claiming he was never warned the blockbuster drug could lead to irreversible vision loss.

	"If they would have told me a chance I could lose my vision, I would not have taken it. Don't care - weight loss would have done on my own," he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;He’s not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="block"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long Island-based attorney Jason Goldstein, of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourlawyer.com/"&gt;Parker Waichman LLP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, represents more than a dozen clients, including Fanelli, in lawsuits that center on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the active ingredient in Ozempic and similar drugs, which has now been linked in medical literature to NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Goldstein claims the drugmakers failed to warn patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"That's the crux of this case, people are not warned about this. What did the doctor know? What did the patient know? No one knew," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Goldstein says he will be pushing for updated warning labels and compensation so future patients don't find themselves negatively impacted by a drug they thought would help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A Novo Nordisk spokesperson released the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"NAION is a very rare eye disease, and it is not an adverse drug reaction for the marketed formulations of semaglutide (Ozempic®, Rybelsus® and Wegovy®) as per the approved labels. After a thorough evaluation of studies from the University of Southern Denmark and Novo Nordisk’s internal safety assessment, Novo Nordisk is of the opinion that the benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Novo Nordisk, on its part, has conducted an analysis across randomized controlled clinical trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including a blinded ophthalmologist evaluation to confirm NAION diagnoses. These data do not suggest a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA use and NAION events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously. This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes.

But with many of us at desk jobs from 9 to 5 (on a good day) and a limitless Netflix queue, actually getting in those steps can be difficult. But the latest walking trend has a solution. The 6-6-6 Walking Challenge is a daily routine that creates enough structure to reap those benefits but enough flexibility to make sure you can actually follow through, even on busy days. The guidelines are incredibly simple, but experts say the intentionality that makes the 6-6-6 Challenge different than &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/12-3-30-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;other forms of walking&lt;/a&gt; can help increase calorie burn and the effectiveness of the walk itself. So, of course, I had to find out more. Keep reading for the breakdown of the 6-6-6 Walking Challenge and how it can help you step up your daily (step) count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-6-6-6-walking-trend"&gt;&lt;span id="What_is_the_6-6-6_Walking_Trend"&gt;What is the 6-6-6 Walking Trend?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The 6-6-6 walking workout is a trending routine that involves walking for 60 minutes a day, either at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m., with a 6-minute warm-up and 6-minute cool-down built in,” explained Matt Dustin, an NASM corrective exercise specialist and certified Precision Nutrition coach at &lt;a href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Garage Gym Reviews&lt;/a&gt;. “The idea is to make walking part of your daily rhythm while giving your body time to ease into and out of the effort.” During a brisk, 60-minute walk, you can log &lt;a href="https://www.womansworld.com/weight-loss/6-6-6-walking-challenge-can-speed-weight-loss-results-how-to-start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;around 5,500 steps&lt;/a&gt;, getting you more than halfway to the gold-standard goal of &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/walking-10000-steps-a-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;10,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether on a walking pad, your favorite hiking trail, or your go-to neighborhood loop, there are no rules or guidelines on how you carry out the workout other than the time of day and a timed warm-up and cool-down. While 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. may sound too early or late—depending on whether you’re a night owl or an early bird—the time options are intended to lower the chances of procrastination and allow you to fit it around your busy schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for the warm-up and cool-down, Dustin recommends not overthinking it. To loosen up your body, mobility exercises like arm circles and leg swings (stand sideways next to a wall, holding onto it for balance with your hand closest to it, and swing the opposite leg forward and back like a pendulum) will do the trick, while the cool-down can look like &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/how-to-stretch-after-exercising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;post-workout stretches&lt;/a&gt; to help your hamstring, calf, and quad muscles recover. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-its-health-benefits"&gt;&lt;span id="What_Are_Its_Health_Benefits"&gt;What Are Its Health Benefits?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking can do no wrong, no matter how you do it—it’s proven to be an effective form of exercise with &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/walking-10000-steps-a-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tons of benefits&lt;/a&gt;. But Dustin stands behind the 6-6-6 walking workout as a better way to go about your strolls since it’s more intentional and structured. “A 60-minute daily walk at a consistent time helps form a habit, and [the 6-6-6] includes components like a warm-up and cool-down, which reduce stiffness, help prevent injury, and promote recovery, that people often skip. The time commitment also provides a stronger cardiovascular and mental health benefit than shorter, sporadic walks.” By moving at a steady pace for a full hour, you build endurance and leg strength gradually and safely without much risk of overdoing it, and you can lower your resting heart rate and blood pressure over time. And if you do the 6-6-6 walk consistently, consider weight management (by increasing daily calorie burn without high impact on the joints) a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-it-better-to-do-the-6-6-6-walking-workout-at-6-a-m-or-6-p-m"&gt;&lt;span id="Is_it_better_to_do_the_6-6-6_walking_workout_at_6_am_or_6_pm"&gt;Is it better to do the 6-6-6 walking workout at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m.?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for the ongoing debate over &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/is-it-better-to-exercise-at-night-or-morning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;whether it’s better to work out in the morning or evening&lt;/a&gt;, Dustin said when it comes to doing the 6-6-6 walking workout, both arguments have valid points going for them. “Walking at a set time, especially early in the morning or the evening, helps regulate your circadian rhythm. Morning walks expose you to natural light, which can support better sleep at night, while evening walks help lower stress from the day.” Since both morning and evening workouts have pros and cons, the short answer is &lt;em&gt;whenever you can&lt;/em&gt;, depending on your routine, lifestyle, and how your body responds. The key is to align your walking routine with your physical needs and daily schedule. If you struggle with sleep or like to feel more productive during the day, doing the 6-6-6 at 6 a.m. is probably the best choice. However, if you don’t feel motivated in the morning or need to unwind after the workday, you’ll likely get more out of it at 6 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-verdict"&gt;&lt;span id="The_Verdict"&gt;The Verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to build consistency and give your physical and mental health a reliable pick-me-up without needing equipment or a gym, the 6-6-6 workout checks out. “Walking is one of the most sustainable forms of exercise, and this version helps you structure it into your daily life in a simple but effective way,” Dustin said. That said, since the &lt;a href="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity along with a minimum of two days of muscle-strengthening exercises every week, it’s best to incorporate some &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/weight-lifting-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;weight lifting&lt;/a&gt; two to three times per week to round out the 6-6-6 routine. Better yet, make it a habit stack and try &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/bala-bangles-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;weighted walks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a full 60 minutes to commit, break it up however you can (think: two 30-minute walks or six 10-minute strides). As with any workout, for the 6-6-6 challenge to be worthwhile, it has to be realistic, consistent, and sustainable for you. The moment it becomes a stressor rather than something that fills your cup, you’ve lost the purpose, and you’re not going to maintain it long-term. 6-6-6 walking challenge or not, prioritize joy and put your best foot forward.&lt;/p&gt;

And people who fall ill with norovirus are contagious from the time they start feeling ill to a few days after they recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is easily spread through direct contact with infected people, touching contaminated surfaces or eating food prepared by someone who is infected. Symptoms can develop within 12 to 48 hours of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;            &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/z6c0oi/picture297718168/alternates/FREE_1140/1192ea8a-2c85-4c46-84a6-2ee878c12a96" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;

In mice with a mutated &lt;em&gt;NLRP3&lt;/em&gt; gene, inflammation activated microglia to release IL-1β, overstimulating NMDA glutamate receptors responsible for excitatory brain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This overactivation triggered anxiety and meaningless repetitive actions. Administering memantine or interleukin-1RA, both FDA-approved drugs, normalized brain activity and stopped the behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic brain inflammation from &lt;em&gt;NLRP3&lt;/em&gt; mutation causes repetitive behaviors via NMDA receptor overactivation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Repurposing:&lt;/strong&gt; FDA-approved drugs memantine and interleukin-1RA reversed these effects in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cytokine Cascade:&lt;/strong&gt; IL-1β released by microglia plays a key role in triggering behavioral symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DGIST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetitive behaviors, such as repeatedly checking whether doors are locked or washing one’s hands multiple times, may be experienced by anyone at least once and may result in ASD or OCD if the behaviors are severe. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although neural circuit abnormalities and genetic factors have been regarded among the potential causes of repetitive behaviors, no direct association between brain inflammation and these behaviors was identified until Professor Um’s research team suggested that brain inflammation may play a critical role in repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110143"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers also found clues about how brain inflammation stimulates NMDA glutamate receptors. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research involved mice with a mutated NLRP3 gene. This gene mutation stimulates a chronic inflammatory response by immune cells in the brain that are called microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged inflammation over-activates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, which are important for excitatory neurotransmission. The consequences are meaningless repetitive behaviors and anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having noted that over-activate NMDA glutamate receptors cause repetitive behaviors, the research team administered a drug called memantine, a commercially available treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, to the mice with the NLRP3 gene mutation and found that the drug significantly reduced meaningless repetitive behaviors and that NMDA glutamate activity returned to normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that over-active NMDA glutamate receptors directly cause repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found clues about how brain inflammation stimulates NMDA glutamate receptors. They have revealed that inflamed microglia release a pro-inflammatory substance (cytokine) called interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), which affects NMDA glutamate receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mice were injected with a drug that blocks the activity of interleukin-1 receptors (interleukin-1RA), it suppressed overactivity in the NMDA glutamate receptors, and the repetitive behaviors disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memantine and interleukin-1RA (product name: Anakinra), which were used in the study, are treatments that are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are currently used to manage Alzheimer’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These readily available drugs of proven safety and efficacy can be repurposed to treat ASD and OCD, negating the need to develop new drugs. As a strategy, drug repurposing reduces drug discovery time and costs, helping to commercialize treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Jiwon Um said, “This study has demonstrated that chronic brain inflammation induces overactivity in NMDA glutamate receptors, resulting in repetitive behavioral disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We may be able to suggest a new therapeutic approach for treating ASD and OCD, which are often accompanied by repetitive behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hyeji Jung of the Department of Brain Sciences within the DGIST was the first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research findings were published online on May 7, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, a scientific journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Ministry of Science and Information Communication Technology and the National Research Foundation of Korea as part of the Basic Research Center Support Project and the Mid-Career Researcher Support Project.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this inflammation, ASD, and OCD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3f7a6b5a6b1b283a7a4aab0b7eda2a0eda8b1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wankyu Lim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dgist.ac.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DGIST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Wankyu Lim – DGIST&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia regulates repetitive behavior by modulating NMDA glutamate receptor functions&lt;/a&gt;” by Jiwon Um et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia regulates repetitive behavior by modulating NMDA glutamate receptor functions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation is a well-established risk factor for various neurological disorders and cognitive decline. However, the precise molecular mechanisms linking inflammation with neuropsychiatric symptoms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, using NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3) conditional knockin (cKI) mice harboring a D301N point mutation originating in patients with autoinflammatory diseases, we found that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by administration of lipopolysaccharide induced anxiety-like and repetitive behaviors frequently found in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as increasing NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor)-mediated excitatory synaptic functions in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), a downstream cytokine of the NLRP3 inflammasome, enhanced NMDAR activation and increased surface levels of the selective NMDAR subunit GluN2A in cultured cortical neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, treatment with an NMDAR antagonist or IL-1 receptor antagonist completely normalized the specific behavioral deficits in &lt;em&gt;Nlrp3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;D301N&lt;/sup&gt;-cKI mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, our results demonstrate that NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation elicits repetitive behavior through impaired NMDAR functions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 21:04:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5PWTZUb3ptSzJUM0hKbG5pMzhIYnVXbW4wQTJ5MUxGTVkzbmY5MHY4a016MHcxMnd3Z3lnMFNGam02amJxZUZGV3ZFalRTeUhCN3hXV2hSZlR5TGZRa1lydVhDM2FlWFRyekI4UFdfaWlaSDQ</guid></item><item><title>干燥综合征患者罹患非霍奇金淋巴瘤的风险较高：研究-干燥综合征新闻 | Sjögren’s patients have higher risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Study - Sjogren's Syndrome News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQdVY3eW5QZm9NYjJ2eDAzYi1VWC1TVlpGOW1lRWVEckREVGFnUUxoSFE3ZVYxZ3lBN0ktemdYLUdmRklXd0szQjJmZmM4NXllQVBfbUY3OW1GSDl0Q2J5S2tLak5lNXJtSFNGenFzQk9BUk1aNklBLUJydGRfbXQ0bE11XzdfdWFkcGV3djlLTG1IcEdRRFhsTFJfcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/what-is-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s disease&lt;/a&gt; are at higher risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a type of blood cancer, as well as other malignancies, a study reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers also identified several risk factors associated with &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/news/analysis-finds-increased-risk-cancer-sjogrens-syndrome-patients/"&gt;cancer development&lt;/a&gt; in Sjögren’s patients, noting that nearly a quarter of deaths seen among these patients could be attributed to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings underscore the need for early identification of high-risk patients and the refinement of risk prediction models,” researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049017225001143"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cancer risk in Sjögren’s Disease: A longitudinal cohort study on incidence, predictors, and mortality impact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Link between Sjögren’s, solid tumors investigated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sjögren’s is a chronic autoimmune disorder marked by dry eyes and mouth, among &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;other symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown Sjögren’s is linked to an increased risk of NHL. However, research remains split on whether other types of cancer, particularly solid tumors, are more likely to arise in people with Sjögren’s than in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this link, researchers examined data from 314 people &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/diagnosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;diagnosed with Sjögren’s&lt;/a&gt; who were receiving care at one of several clinics in Spain. Most (94.6%) were female, and were diagnosed at a median age of 49.9 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a median of 9.5 years of follow-up, 7% of patients developed cancer. Of these, half developed blood cancer, specifically NHL. The other half had solid malignancies, with breast cancer being the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with people in Spain of similar age and sex, patients with Sjögren’s had a 68% higher chance of developing cancer. That risk was even higher for blood cancers, with Sjögren’s patients being 3.55 times more likely to develop such cancers than people from the general population. For solid tumors, the risk was 1.54 times higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NHL alone accounted for the most of the excess cancer risk, underscoring its central role in [Sjögren’s disease]-associated malignancy,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using statistical analyses, the researchers identified a series of risk factors associated with cancer development in Sjögren’s patients. Malignancy predictors included lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), cryoglobulinemia (a condition where abnormal proteins clump in the blood), and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). Older age and smoking were identified as independent risk factors for cancer development as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;NHL alone accounted for the most of the excess cancer risk, underscoring its central role in [Sjögren’s disease]-associated malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team also found a prior history of cancer in Sjögren’s patients significantly increased the risk of blood cancer development over that of a solid malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses showed significantly more participants with blood cancers used antimalarials, a class of medications that can also help manage Sjögren’s symptoms, than participants with solid tumors. Patients with blood cancers also had higher levels of beta-2 microglobulin, a small protein that can be used as a tumor marker, compared with those with solid malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the follow-up period, cancer accounted for 23.8% of deaths among study participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings underscore the substantial impact of malignancy on overall mortality, revealing that cancer-related deaths account for a significant proportion of excess mortality in [Sjögren’s disease] patients,” the researchers wrote. “These results reinforce the need for tailored malignancy screening strategies …, particularly for high-risk patients with identified predictors such as lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and cryoglobulinemia.”&lt;/p&gt;

Anxiety was found to be the key mechanism mediating the relationship between neuroticism and insomnia, while depression was not a significant factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroticism Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; 61.7% of insomniacs had high neuroticism vs. 32% of non-insomniacs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Trait:&lt;/strong&gt; Openness to experience was linked with lower insomnia rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Anxiety fully mediates the relationship between neuroticism and insomnia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAPESP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study conducted at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo (USP) in Brazil examined the influence of personality traits on the development and perpetuation of insomnia and found that there is a direct relationship between the two. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two findings caught the researchers’ attention: high levels of openness were associated with low levels of insomnia, while high levels of neuroticism (characterized by emotional instability) were very common in people with the sleep disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sleep Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We decided to study the influence of personality traits on insomnia because it’s an extremely common disorder that has negative health consequences, such as an increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These different physical and mental health conditions lead to a poorer quality of life in general,” explains Bárbara Araújo Conway, sleep psychologist and author of the master’s dissertation defended at the Institute of Psychiatry of FM-USP, with the support of FAPESP and under the supervision of Professor Renatha El Rafihi-Ferreira, of the Department of Clinical Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the authors explain, insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders in adults. It is estimated that around 30% of the world’s population suffers from the problem, which is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep or returning to sleep after an unwanted awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, specifically in the city of São Paulo, this figure is even higher: almost half of the population (45%) suffers from insomnia, according to data from the Epidemiological Sleep Study (EPISONO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five personality traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Conway, there is a well-established theory in the literature that proposes the existence of the “3 Ps” of insomnia: predisposition (factors that make an individual more likely to have the disorder), precipitation (triggers associated with the onset of symptoms) and perpetuation (behaviors that cause the person to remain in the vicious cycle of insomnia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the researchers hypothesized that neuroticism, which is more prevalent in insomniacs, could be considered a predisposing factor for sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also examined whether symptoms of anxiety and depression might act as mediators and moderators of the association between neuroticism and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to understand how the authors arrived at the results of the study, we need to take a step back and learn about personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are characteristics that estimate a pattern of what a particular person’s feelings, thoughts and behaviors are like. They’re a set of factors that make up an individual’s personality and characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“According to the Big Five theory, we all have different levels of the five personality traits,” the psychologist explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Extroversion:&lt;/strong&gt; People with higher levels of extroversion tend to be more talkative, more dominant, with a leadership profile. They prefer group activities, find it easier to relate and create intimacy and tend to be more assertive. People with low levels of extroversion, on the other hand, are not necessarily introverts, but they prefer to be more alone and tend to find it more difficult to work in groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Neuroticism: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a personality trait related to the degree of emotional stability. People with high levels of neuroticism tend to be more emotionally unstable and focus on the more negative aspects of life. They are people who, when faced with adversity, tend to become disorganized, suffer more intensely, and are more susceptible to stress. Scientific literature shows that high neuroticism correlates with anxiety and depression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Agreeableness: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a personality trait related to empathy. People with high levels of agreeableness tend to be more empathetic, more cordial and concerned about the well-being of others, focusing a lot on the other person’s situation (they may even be naive and value the other person to the detriment of themselves). Those with low scores tend to be more skeptical and suspicious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Openness to experience: &lt;/strong&gt;People who are open to new experiences tend to be more creative, with exploratory behavior in the face of novelty. They are curious, imaginative and experience emotions more intensely. People with low levels of openness are those who prefer routine, avoid discomfort and tend to be conventional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Conscientiousness:&lt;/strong&gt; This can also be called achievement. People with high levels are determined, committed, motivated, persevering and can sacrifice momentary pleasures in pursuit of a greater goal. A very high index may not be good because it can lead to perfectionism. Those with low scores are less demanding, less stubborn, and would be considered “lazy” in the common sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To arrive at the results, the researchers studied 595 participants between the ages of 18 and 59, divided into two groups: one made up of insomniacs who had sought help and received a formal diagnosis from a sleep specialist, and the other half was a control group of people who had no complaints of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant’s personality levels were determined using a 60-question, score-based questionnaire used exclusively by psychology professionals. Volunteers from both groups answered the questions, allowing the researchers to determine the scores for each person’s personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying the questionnaire to the two groups, cross-checking and analyzing the data, Conway found that the insomnia patients had much higher scores for neuroticism than the non-insomnia subjects, as well as lower scores for agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extroversion was the only personality trait that did not show a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neuroticism was the trait that stood out the most, with insomniacs having a much higher rate. But we can’t say that insomniacs are more introverted,” Conway ponders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyses also showed that: 61.7% of the insomniacs had high levels of neuroticism compared to 32% of the control group; 40.7% of the insomniacs had low levels of openness compared to 23% of the healthy group; 31.5% of the subjects with insomnia had low levels of agreeableness compared to 23.2% of the non-insomniacs; and 37.7% of the insomniacs had low levels of conscientiousness compared to 24.1% of the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After more detailed statistical analysis, the results of the study allow us to assert that people with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to have insomnia,” says the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also carried out a statistical analysis to see if any other factor might be confounding the association between neuroticism and insomnia, and discovered that anxiety acts as a mediating mechanism, meaning that it is the symptoms of anxiety that actually cause neuroticism to influence the development of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It explains the whole effect of high neuroticism on insomnia,” says the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also tested the role of depression, but it did not prove to be an important mechanism in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect on practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that personality traits are associated with positive or negative physical and mental health outcomes, the study suggests that it is important to know the most prevalent personality traits among individuals with insomnia so that this knowledge can help in the process of assessment, prevention and planning of more appropriate treatments according to the specific characteristics of each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results confirm that in order to treat a patient’s insomnia, it is also necessary to assess and treat their anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are important in clinical practice because when receiving patients with this personality trait, it’s essential to think about a treatment plan that focuses not only on sleep but also on anxiety,” says El Rafihi-Ferreira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for this to happen, healthcare professionals need to understand and assess the personalities of patients who seek help for sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that most insomniacs are highly neurotic. These patients deserve to have their anxiety assessed and treated so that their insomnia also improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes this involves different therapies and medications, so it’s important to take a broader look at each individual’s history and specifics,” Conway emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the treatment considered the “gold standard” for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), but there are still too few psychologists specializing in sleep in Brazil to offer it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the researchers advocate that health professionals take a broader view and delve deeper into the study of patients’ psychological factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The association between personality traits, anxiety and insomnia makes it important to develop transdiagnostic treatment protocols, i.e. those that involve the integration of behavioral techniques and processes to treat a range of emotional difficulties that share processes and mechanisms underlying the different complaints,” says the study’s supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already have a non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia, but just as we don’t have a drug that will be effective for all patients, a single therapy approach may not work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results contribute to the development of new, more personalized psychological and behavioral protocols for the treatment of insomnia,” Conway concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this insomnia and personality traits research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8ee6fcebe7e0ebfcfacee8effeebfdfea0ecfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heloisa Reinert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fapesp.br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAPESP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Heloisa Reinert – FAPESP&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jsr.70003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Personality traits and insomnia: direct and anxiety-mediated associations&lt;/a&gt;” by Bárbara Araújo Conway et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sleep Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality traits and insomnia: direct and anxiety-mediated associations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia is the one of the most prevalent sleep disorders in the adult population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that personality traits, particularly neuroticism, act as factors that predispose to and potentially perpetuate insomnia; however, there is still no consensus in the literature regarding these relationships considering their mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 595 participants answered the Insomnia Severity Index, Revised Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness (NEO) Five-Factor Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, questions of the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/em&gt; (fifth edition), and a sociodemographic questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descriptive analysis, correlations and stepwise linear regression were used to assess the associations between the five personality traits and insomnia severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediation and moderation analyses were performed to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the association between insomnia severity and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a direct negative association between insomnia severity and openness to experience and an indirect positive association between insomnia severity and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety was identified as a mediator and depression as a moderator of the association between insomnia severity and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neuroticism and openness to experience personality traits are significant predictors of insomnia severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Openness to experience appears to be a protective factor against insomnia. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results may contribute to the development of new psychological and behavioural protocols for the treatment of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 20:27:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9zbzVzTTQ1NkN1X2xZS01XZjNBdnpBYzJGeURqU3VkVGdldDIwUUhVTjF6MlV5MTJZUVcyTFFYSmg4djhLOGhDbUtYb08zR3ZWaV93QTIzTzRjSG1zaUZWR0xUWEM1eVlwbnBLUkpGMVdoQWpTbnNv</guid></item><item><title>布莱恩·约翰逊（ Bryan Johnson ）、梅尔·吉布森（ Mel Gibson- ） ，可能还有小RFK （ RFK Jr. ）穿着亚甲蓝以下是科学所说的-财富 | Bryan Johnson, Mel Gibson—and possibly RFK Jr.—swear by methylene blue for wellness.

&lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Health officials reported that there were six cases of measles in 2024.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;What is measles?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p original-article-post="" data-v-ec26887a data-v-d11d7278&gt;Dig deeper:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus can linger in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours after the infected individual has left the area. Symptoms typically appear between seven and 14 days after exposure and often begin with a high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. A rash of small, red spots usually follows, starting at the head and spreading across the body. Health experts emphasize that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine remains the most effective defense against infection. The CDC recommends children receive the first dose of the MMR vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age, followed by a second dose between 4 and 6 years old.

It’s not a genetic inevitability — there are many species in the tree of life where &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/science/anglerfish-evolution-sex.html" title=""&gt;females outclass males&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A new &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2503039122" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study, published on Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that involved genetic data from a million people, has found a partial explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It involves a gene called SHOX, which is known to be associated with height. SHOX is present on both the X chromosome — females have two X chromosomes — and the Y chromosome; males have one X and one Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The researchers suspected that SHOX might explain differences in male and female height, but there was a problem with that hypothesis. Since SHOX is on both the X and Y chromosomes, it would need to have a different effect on each chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Does it, the researchers asked?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To investigate the hypothesis, they asked if an extra Y chromosome boosted a person’s height more than an extra X chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There are rare conditions in which people are born with an extra X or an extra Y, or have a missing X or Y.

Whether you hopped on the bandwagon and began drinking &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/personal-care/can-prebiotic-soda-hurt-your-teeth-heres-what-experts-say/" target="_self"&gt;prebiotic or probiotic beverages&lt;/a&gt;, many people have become obsessed with healing their gut to avoid embarrassing symptoms like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/we-all-bloat-but-heres-how-to-know-if-its-a-problem/" target="_self"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt; and/or flatulence. In fact, the trillions of microbes living in your gut, collectively known as the &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/microbiome/" target="_self"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, serve as your body's internal environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Consider your &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-microbiome#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-microbiome%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22gut%20microbiome%22}" target="_self"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; as "little pets living inside your intestinal tract," Cleveland Clinic microbiome expert Gail Cresci explains. These microbes help break down food, regulate inflammation, support immunity and even produce essential compounds like vitamins and hormones. This is why it's vital to understand your body's warning signs and be able to identify when something is not quite right. So to answer the big question of how to keep your gut healthy, read on for a couple of health hacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/experts-share-what-your-bowel-movements-say-about-your-health/" target="_self"&gt; Are Your Poops Regular? Experts Share What Your Bowel Movements Mean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs of an unhealthy gut &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're bloated or you have lots of gas, you may have a disrupted composition and function of the gut microbiome," Cresci said, adding that the only way to know for sure is to have it &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/microbiome-testing" target="_self"&gt;measured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other signs of an unhealthy gut may include vomiting or stomach upset, fatigue, trouble sleeping, food intolerance &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gut-health#improving-gut-health" target="_self"&gt;and other symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Skin irritation or problems may be one particularly visible sign, as some research &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048199/" target="_self"&gt;links skin issues like acne and psoriasis&lt;/a&gt; to the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking into how it &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/hropen/article/2022/2/hoac015/6553029" target="_self"&gt;impacts reproductive health&lt;/a&gt; and hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/the-abcs-of-apple-cider-vinegar-benefits-precautions-and-proper-dosage/" target="_self"&gt;The ABCs of Apple Cider Vinegar: Benefits, Precautions and Proper Dosage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Carol Yepes/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to help your gut &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to see a doctor to get to the root cause of your health concern and rule out other conditions. Making changes to your diet or routine that may improve your gut, and your overall health is a good first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to keep in mind that there's no exact standard for the perfectly healthy gut microbiome, Cresci said, since everyone's composition is so different. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Eat these gut-friendly foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes foods with a lot of fiber, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods to remove from your gut, or eat in lower amounts, include foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/5-heart-healthy-foods-to-add-to-your-grocery-list-this-week/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Make note of the medications you're taking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a well-known fact that taking antibiotics &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732679/" target="_self"&gt;disrupts, at least temporarily, the family of "good" bacteria&lt;/a&gt; thriving in your body. Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/pdfs/aaw/au_arent_always_the_answer_fs_508.pdf" target="_self"&gt;common side effects&lt;/a&gt; of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the PH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists, or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; probiotics or supplements &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/news/7-best-probiotics/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;seek a probiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/how-do-probiotics-improve-your-gut-health/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mimic an intact microbiota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and "each strain has their own method of action." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking it for bowel regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever it is your problem is," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unfortunately, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you," Cresci said. "You have to do the other part too." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;piotr_malczyk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Move your body every day and prioritize sleep &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get better sleep" or "exercise more" might sound like tired advice, but improving your sleep hygiene and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/10-workouts-youre-probably-already-doing-every-day/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;squeezing in more physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are tried and true ways to improve your health, including your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise may &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;help your gut in different ways&lt;/a&gt;, including by improving your circulation, helping your metabolism and aiding your digestive muscles, according to information from the Cleveland Clinic. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/exercise-snacks-are-just-as-healthy-as-a-full-workout-heres-why/" target="_self"&gt;small ways&lt;/a&gt; you can get your body in the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;habit of moving every day&lt;/a&gt; or at least more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too. So if we're eating when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to properly process the nutrients of our food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking sleep also triggers an increase in stress and cortisol, which have &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative mental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and physical impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot going on with the gut-brain interaction, so that signals back to the microbiome, and vice versa," Cresci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.637010/full#h11" target="_self"&gt;including exercising&lt;/a&gt; or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which impact our gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're sleepy, tired, exhausted, you tend not to do the things we know are good for microbiomes," Cresci said. "So it kind of perpetuates itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq" class="c-shortcodeFaq g-container-rounded-small"&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_sections" class="c-shortcodeFaq_sections"&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding fiber to your diet and drinking more water are easy first steps to a healthier gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, probiotics like curd are good bacteria that assist with digestion and improve your microbiome and overall gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQaGN4LUM1ZkVqTnlpWS1HSWtzdDZ6VGtwZXRjZXplT0JLM3F0S1pHYjZCYWpDN29qR0szTm9QbXdabGRuWkZ6TkVCaVptUmgzXzN4S1dQZlNFb3hBcGF5WmNQbXhCdlI5cEhMb3I1YkxVN1dNX2tvaWp0ZmV0MHZQRFA1Y1MtU2dpTFJr</guid></item><item><title>当您每天吃山核桃时，胆固醇会发生什么变化？ - Verywell Health | What Happens to Your Cholesterol When You Eat Pecans Every Day? - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE1oQ1dfY0xsR3JmNlNmRTdlTmR6U295MEk0UWJ6QjFnRFdjTWJlTERJQzJyMGtRWFVnbjJlaFBjckhDbDNNLTJoLU1MOEwwS0x1ODNDaU0tUHFhcEFUc3pYN2FZUFdYY0RUM0xpTnZfamhLQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Considering a healthy snack between meals?

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study, published in &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, included 138 adults between ages 25 and 70.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The participants were split into two groups: one ate about two ounces of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/pecans-8358277" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;raw, unsalted pecans daily&lt;/a&gt;, while the other continued with their usual snacks. All participants underwent medical testing, including cholesterol and blood pressure checks, before and after the study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By the end of the trial, blood tests showed that those who ate pecans had &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-that-lower-cholesterol-5189944" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and better overall diet quality compared to the control group.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings suggest the benefits weren’t just from eating nuts generally, but specifically from pecans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Pecans have a unique polyphenol content compared to some of the other tree nuts so that made us interested," said &lt;a href="https://hhd.psu.edu/contact/kristina-petersen" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kristina Petersen, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author of the study and a associate professor of nutritional sciences at Penn State University.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/polyphenols-5217399" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; in pecans may support healthy blood vessels. People who ate pecans daily in the study consumed more fiber and polyunsaturated fats, which likely contributed to improvements in LDL cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Previous research supports these findings. A 2018 study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; found that replacing some saturated fat in a typical American diet with a handful of pecans daily helped protect people at risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(Both studies were funded by pecan industry groups.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Poor diet plays a major role in cardiometabolic diseases, the leading cause of death in the United States, said &lt;a href="https://theresagentilerd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Theresa Gentile, MS, RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nuts, including pecans, are part of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/heart-healthy-diet-11692926" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; and may improve risk factors for these diseases,” Gentile told.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Gentile emphasized that pecans should not replace cholesterol medication. “Lifestyle changes can help improve cholesterol levels and enhance how well medications work, but food doesn’t have the same effect as medication,” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While statins can reduce LDL cholesterol by 20% to 60%, the new study found that pecans reduced total cholesterol by 3.6% and LDL by 6%.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with irregular sleep schedules had a 26% higher risk of major cardiovascular events—including heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure—even if they got the recommended amount of sleep.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sleep regularity may matter just as much as sleep duration: going to bed and waking up at consistent times was linked to significantly better heart health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The study found a clear dose-response relationship, with higher sleep regularity scores tied to lower cardiovascular risk; an SRI score of 77.1 or above was associated with a 15–18% risk reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTTAWA, Canada — &lt;/strong&gt;Even if you’re getting enough sleep overall, inconsistent bedtimes and wake-up times might be putting your heart at serious risk. An international study shows that people with irregular sleep schedules face a significantly higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure, regardless of whether they clock the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/79/4/257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, followed more than 72,000 adults for nearly eight years and discovered that those with the most chaotic sleep patterns had a 26% higher risk of major cardiovascular events compared to people who maintained regular sleep schedules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also found that getting the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sleep-an-important-antidote-for-depression-and-anxiety-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommended amount of sleep&lt;/a&gt; didn’t protect irregular sleepers from heart problems. For millions of Americans whose work schedules, family responsibilities, or lifestyle habits lead to erratic sleep patterns, this could be a wake-up call about a previously underappreciated heart risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from institutions including the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute and the University of Sydney used data from the UK Biobank, analyzing information from 72,269 adults aged 40-79 who wore wrist accelerometers for a week to precisely measure their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt;. The team calculated each participant’s “Sleep Regularity Index” (SRI), a measure that captures day-to-day consistency in bedtime, wake-up time, sleep duration, and awakenings during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;More than just sleep duration goes into your sleep health. (Krakenimages.com/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SRI is scored from 0 (completely random sleep-wake times) to 100 (perfectly consistent sleep patterns). Participants were divided into three groups: those with regular sleep (SRI above 87.3), moderately irregular sleep (SRI between 71.6 and 87.3), and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poor-sleep-gut-harmful-bacteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;irregular sleep&lt;/a&gt; (SRI below 71.6).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After following participants for an average of 7.8 years, researchers documented 4,887 major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)—a measure that includes &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strokes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;. Even after accounting for numerous factors like age, physical activity, diet, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/smoking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/alcohol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, and existing health conditions, the findings remained accurate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-risks-and-irregular-sleep"&gt;Heart Risks and Irregular Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/irregular-sleep-depression-moods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;irregular sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt; had a 26% higher risk of experiencing a MACE event compared to regular sleepers. Even those with moderately irregular sleep patterns showed an 8% increased risk. This connection was particularly strong for heart failure, with irregular sleepers facing a 45% higher risk compared to consistent sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also looked at the combination of sleep regularity and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/better-sleep-green-streets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep duration&lt;/a&gt;. Conventional wisdom might suggest that as long as you’re getting enough sleep, some irregularity wouldn’t matter. This data shows that might not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with irregular sleep patterns faced an elevated &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/periodontitis-gum-disease-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular risk&lt;/a&gt; even if they slept the recommended 7-9 hours (for adults under 65) or 7-8 hours (for those 65 and older). While sufficient sleep partially offset the risk for moderately irregular sleepers, it didn’t help those with the most erratic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The relationship between sleep irregularity and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/heart-problems-brain-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular problems&lt;/a&gt; appears to follow a dose-response pattern. This means that the more irregular your sleep, the higher your risk. However, the researchers identified a threshold: an SRI score of at least 77.1 was associated with a 15% reduction in cardiovascular risk, while the median score of 80.8 correlated with an 18% risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-inconsistent-sleep-hurts-your-heart"&gt;Why Inconsistent Sleep Hurts Your Heart&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What explains this connection? When sleep patterns vary widely, it causes circadian misalignment,  essentially throwing off the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/high-fat-diets-body-clock-obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body’s internal clock&lt;/a&gt;. This disruption can cascade into various physiological changes that stress the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These disruptions can lead to problems with glucose and lipid metabolism, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/diabetes-insulin-producing-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system, all factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Irregular sleep patterns were more common among certain groups in the study. People who reported &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health issues&lt;/a&gt;, those taking medications for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cholesterol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and individuals working night shifts were all more likely to have irregular sleep patterns. Current smokers also tended to have less regular sleep compared to non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recommendations about sleep duration have become common in recent years, with the American Heart Association even adding sleep duration to its “Life’s Essential 8” metrics for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/7-keys-to-sleep-health-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, but sleep regularity has received far less attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those looking to improve sleep regularity, experts suggest maintaining a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sleep-schedule-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;consistent sleep schedule&lt;/a&gt; (even on weekends), establishing a relaxing bedtime routine, and creating a sleep-conducive environment. How consistently we sleep may be just as important as how long we sleep—and for your heart’s sake, sticking to regular bedtimes might matter more than we previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a prospective cohort study using data from the UK Biobank, focusing on 72,269 adults aged 40-79 who wore wrist accelerometers for 7 days. They calculated a Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) for each participant using validated algorithms that measure consistency in sleep-wake patterns. Participants were categorized as having irregular sleep (SRI &amp;lt;71.6), moderately irregular sleep (SRI 71.6-87.3), or regular sleep (SRI &amp;gt;87.3). They also classified participants based on whether they met age-specific sleep duration recommendations (7-9 hours for ages 18-64, 7-8 hours for those 65+). Information on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was obtained from hospitalization and death records, with participants followed for an average of 7.8 years. The researchers excluded participants with previous history of MACE or who had an event in the first year of follow-up to reduce reverse causation. They used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for numerous confounders including age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, physical activity, screen time, diet, coffee intake, alcohol consumption, smoking, mental health, medication use, family history, shift work, and self-reported sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that irregular sleepers had a 26% higher risk of MACE (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.16-1.37) and moderately irregular sleepers had an 8% higher risk (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.70) compared to regular sleepers. When examining MACE subtypes, irregular sleep was associated with a 45% higher risk of heart failure, 23% higher risk of myocardial infarction, and 22% higher risk of stroke. The relationship between SRI and MACE risk was near-linear, with steeper risk reduction at higher SRI scores. An SRI score of at least 77.1 was associated with a 15% reduction in MACE risk. Joint analyses of sleep regularity and duration showed that meeting sleep duration recommendations offset MACE risk for moderately irregular sleepers (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.18), but not for irregular sleepers (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.35), indicating that adequate sleep duration cannot compensate for highly irregular sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study has several limitations. The UK Biobank had a low response rate (5.5%), which may affect representativeness of the broader population. Covariate assessments were conducted at a single time point rather than treated as time-varying factors, with a median lag of 5.5 years between baseline measurements and the accelerometry sub-study. While the study design allows for assessing associations, randomized experiments would be needed for stronger causal inference. Sleep was measured over only a single week, which may not fully capture long-term sleep patterns. The accelerometry method has limitations in distinguishing between quiet wakefulness and sleep, potentially leading to misclassification. Additionally, the SRI algorithm did not detect napping, only the longest sleep period of the day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource and funded through Dr. Stamatakis’ Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Investigator Grant. Several authors disclosed potential conflicts of interest: Dr. Cistulli has an endowed Academic Chair at the University of Sydney created from ResMed funding (though he receives no personal fees) and has received research support from ResMed, SomnoMed, and Bayer, and serves as consultant to these companies. Dr. Rajaratnam declared grants from Vanda Pharmaceuticals, WA Police, and the CDC, consulting fees from Roche and Circadian Therapeutics, honoraria from Roche, and holds a patent for a digital application for sleep in shift workers. Other authors declared no competing interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. We want you to love the meals you’re eating! If there’s a meal you don’t like, definitely feel free to substitute another option. In this meal plan, we aimed for about 1,500 calories, a minimum of 80 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber and a max of 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, as recommended by the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Check out more of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7952332/high-protein-high-fiber-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein, high-fiber dinner ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day, that works! Each breakfast option is between 338 and 364 calories while each lunch is between 355 and 430 calories. These ranges are fairly close and should be fine to swap out, or find another option entirely if that’s preferred. If you’re closely monitoring your calories, protein, fiber or other nutrients, you may want to be mindful to choose a swap with similar stats or adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What are the health benefits of fiber?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiber is a type of indigestible carbohydrate found in whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. It has many health benefits and has been tagged as our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053298/best-nutrient-for-weight-loss-according-to-gastroenterologist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;No. 1 nutrient for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, improved blood sugar levels and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber is probably best known for its role in helping to reduce constipation and regulate bowel movements, but it’s also an important nutrient for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_161-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein and fiber both help us feel full, which can help with weight loss, but their mechanisms are different. Fiber is broken down slowly, meaning it stays in our digestive tract longer and promotes feelings of fullness. Soluble fiber hangs out in the large intestine, where it ferments and forms short-chain fatty acids that regulate appetite, influence fat storage and reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When protein is digested, satiety hormones that help us feel full are released and the hunger-inducing hormone, ghrelin, is suppressed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though their mechanisms are different, it’s clear that a routine that provides plenty of protein and fiber is a great tool for weight loss.

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has green-lit a blood test that can help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. It is the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" data-displayoverlay="displayOverlay" rel="noreferrer"&gt;first blood test to be cleared&lt;/a&gt; by the FDA for the disease, which affects more than 7 million older Americans and is marked by a decline in memory and thinking skills.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;The test, called Lumipulse, can detect abnormal clumps of protein in the brain, known as amyloid plaques. These plaques disrupt brain cell function and are a hallmark of &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/difference-between-dementia-alzheimers/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="dementia vs alzheimers"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;PET scans and spinal fluid tests can also detect amyloid plaques and have been used for years to help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s. But the tests are expensive and, in the case of the lumbar puncture, invasive. They can also be inaccessible for people in rural areas. Lumipulse, on the other hand, requires only a blood draw in patients 55 and older who are showing signs and symptoms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;“Having a blood test just makes it so much easier in being able to make a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,” said Charles Bernick, M.D., a neurologist with the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, based in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;In its news release, the test’s manufacturer, Fujirebio Diagnostics, didn’t specify the cost of the test.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;People without symptoms shouldn’t test &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;The newly approved blood test measures two proteins in the liquid part of the blood, known as plasma, and then calculates the ratio of these proteins, which is “correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient’s brain, reducing the need for a PET scan,” the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;The test is only meant for older adults who are experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease; &lt;a href="/health/brain-health/alzheimers-diagnosis-before-symptoms/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="alzheimer's diagnosis before symptoms"&gt;it is not a screening test&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, the FDA said, the results should be used along with “other clinical evaluations or additional tests” to determine treatment options. In addition to brain imaging and lumbar punctures, doctors often use neurological exams and cognitive tests, for example, &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/dementia-diagnosis/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="dementia diagnosis"&gt;to diagnose a patient&lt;/a&gt; with Alzheimer’s disease. “It still becomes a diagnosis where you have to really look at the whole picture,” Bernick said.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;In recent years, the FDA has approved two medications for the &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/alzheimers-treatments/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="alzheimer's treatments"&gt;treatment of Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; — Kisunla (donanemab) and Leqembi (lecanemab). These drugs, which are given by infusion, don’t cure the disease but can help to slow the rate of decline in people in its early stages. Because they work by clearing amyloid plaques from the brain, the presence of amyloid must be confirmed before they can be prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;“They carry some risk. So if you’re going to use them or utilize them, you’ve got to be pretty sure the person has that protein in the brain,” Bernick said. Risks can include swelling and bleeding in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

Soon after he was diagnosed with Stage 3 melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg" alt="Sam Gee"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Now almost 20, Sam Gee has been healthy since his treatment for melanoma at 15.

At the time, he was grappling with another unusual health change. About a month prior to tournament, Gee noticed a puffy bump in his upper right leg.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had some serious swelling,” he says. “I thought it was an inguinal hernia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Inguinal hernias occur when part of the intestine pokes through the abdomen near the groin and can look like a bump, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inguinal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351547" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. A visit with a pediatric surgeon revealed what it was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He was like, ‘It’s not a inguinal hernia, but likely a swollen lymph node,’” Gee recalls. “He’s like, ‘It’s just from puberty. … Come back in a few weeks if it hasn’t gone away.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gee then visited a doctor about the mole and underwent a biopsy, which revealed that he had melanoma. It had spread locally, causing the swollen lymph node in his leg. Doctors considered Mohs surgery, where skin is cut away layer by layer to remove the cancer with clear margins, but Gee needed immunotherapy first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the same time, school moved online as the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns had begun. That helped Gee manage some of the symptoms he experienced from immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I would get fatigued a little bit. It would make me nauseous,” he says. “It was a very day-to-day thing. Some days I would feel fantastic. Some days I would feel like I needed to throw up or I was really tired.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In January 2021, Gee underwent surgery and had the melanoma and lymph nodes removed. Following surgery, he completed several more rounds of immunotherapy before he finished treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was disease free,” he says. “That was when they said, ‘OK you’re cured.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Melanoma &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Melanoma occurs most often in “older white males,” and the average age of a patient with metastatic melanoma is in their 60s, says Dr. Hussein Tawbi. But it does occur in younger populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The No. 1 cause of cancer in women between age 30-40 is melanoma, for instance,” Tawbi, director of personalized cancer therapy in the department of melanoma medical oncology in the division of cancer medicine at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer center, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt; But “pediatric melanoma is relatively rare," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg" alt="Sam Gee"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since being diagnosed with melanoma, Sam Gee has become a 'total sunscreen freak.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Gee family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People often develop skin cancer, including melanoma, because of sun exposure. Tawbi urges people to start using sunscreen regularly in childhood, as sun exposure in adolescence and young adulthood increases the risk of metastatic melanoma later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a very direct relationship between sun exposure and a higher incidence of melanoma,” he says. "We do recommend people to start using sunscreen as early as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He also urges people to undergo regular visits to a dermatologist to undergo skin checks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Early diagnosis is still key,” Tawbi says. “If you find the melanoma early enough, it is still largely curable with surgery alone.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts talk about the ABCDEs of skin cancer to help assess if a mole or mark on the skin is cause for concern. Any of these qualities should prompt a visit to the doctor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: Asymmetry, when a mole doesn’t appear the same on both sides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;: Border, when the outside of the mole looks jagged or uneven&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;: Color, when the hue of the mole changes, becoming lighter, darker, white, red or blue &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;: Diameter, when a mole is larger than the size of a pencil eraser &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;: Evolution, when a mole changes or appears to be different &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Surgery can cure 95-99% of early melanomas, Tawbi notes. For those who have advanced stage melanomas, either Stage 3 or 4, immunotherapies can often extend lives. Since about 2010, checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy — a type of treatment that uses the body’s immune system to better fight cancer — have transformed melanoma treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“(They've) absolutely changed everything and started resulting for long-term survival for patients,” Tawbi says. “The survival for melanoma has actually increased by 10-fold.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Before checkpoint inhibitors, the median survival time for metastatic melanomas like Gee's was seven months. Now it is 72 months, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s pretty pretty impressive,” he says. “The only way we got patients to have better survival rates in the last 10 years has been purely through research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;"Total sunscreen freak"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Before being diagnosed with cancer, Gee thought he would pursue electrical engineering or computer science. After his experience as a patient and seeing how technology improves medicine, he’s majoring in biomedical engineering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Seeing all those cool machines and wanting to make those threw me into biomed engineering,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Today, he’s a “total sunscreen freak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg" alt="Sam Gee"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since being diagnosed with melanoma at 15, Sam Gee always uses sunscreen to protect himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Gee family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m all about the sunscreen now,” he says. “I hope people will start wearing their sunscreen. … That’s really what I want to get across is wear sunscreen, don’t tan on purpose.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gee also hopes his story helps other young men with melanoma feel less isolated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“You really don’t see that too much.

Many people type the name of their drug into a Google search. At the top of the list will be “side effects” and links to places like MedlinePlus, Mayo Clinic, GoodRx, Drugs.com, WebMD, Cleveland Clinic or RxList. But where does the drug side effect information &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; come from and is it reliable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Origins of Most Drug Information:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of virtually all drug information originates with the clinical trials conducted for FDA drug approval. The agency and the drug companies negotiate the final wording in the official prescribing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst things like dosing instructions, warnings and precautions and drug interactions, you will discover “&lt;strong&gt;ADVERSE REACTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;.” Virtually all the databases you will find online create lists based on the side effects located in the official prescribing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical words such as “pruritis” will be converted to itching. “Dyspepsia” becomes heartburn. “Hepatotoxicity” turns into liver damage. You get the picture. The basic information is the same, but the words may be a bit more understandable in the databases that try to translate drug side effect information for the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding the Official Prescribing Information:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to find the key information about almost all drugs is by putting &lt;a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/"&gt;DailyMed&lt;/a&gt; into a search engine. &lt;a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/"&gt;Here is the URL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;And here is a description of “ABOUT DAILYMED”:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The National Library of Medicine (NLM)’s DailyMed searchable database provides the most recent labeling submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by companies and currently in use (i.e., “in use” labeling).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;USEFUL Drug Information Is a Rarity:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceuticals are among the most tested, analyzed and scrutinized consumer products in the world. Initial laboratory research and preclinical investigations lead to clinical trials and Food and Drug Administration review. The cost for developing a new medication can range from hundreds of millions to several billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why it comes as such a disappointment to discover that the end users of medications, patients, get so little practical information about the drugs they are expected to take. It’s very hard to tell how effective they will be to resolve a health issue. Patients also get much less practical information than they need about side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare medications with consumer products, for example. Whether it’s a smart phone, a refrigerator, a toaster oven or an automobile, numerous independent organizations test such products and provide quantitative information to assist consumers in making informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Car Information vs. Drug Information:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you go to &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; (CR) and look up a popular car category, say compact SUVs, you will be told an overall score. At a glance, you can see how one vehicle compares to more than a dozen other vehicles in the same class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will also be told the price, predicted reliability, owner satisfaction, overall miles per gallon, seat comfort, usability, noise, ride comfort, fit + finish, routine handling, acceleration and braking distance in feet from 60-0 mph in feet. For example, the Suburu Forester gets an overall CR rating of &lt;strong&gt;93&lt;/strong&gt; compared to the Hyundai Tucson which gets an overall score of &lt;strong&gt;76&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no such rating for medications. Rarely are drugs tested against each other. As a result, even health care professionals may find it tricky to compare one blood pressure medicine to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lisinopril: Effectiveness and Drug Side Effect Information:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the most commonly prescribed blood pressure medicine in America, lisinopril (&lt;strong&gt;Zestril&lt;/strong&gt;). Here’s a fundamental question: How much will lisinopril lower blood pressure? If you check the official prescribing information, you will not find a simple answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;You will be told instead that:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zestril was approximately equivalent to atenolol and metoprolol in reducing diastolic blood pressure, and had somewhat greater effects on systolic blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What About Drug Side Effect Information?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you put “lisinopril side effects” into a search engine, as many people do, you will find several sites, from the Mayo Clinic and GoodRx to Drugs.com and the Cleveland Clinic. The National Library of Medicine offers MedlinePlus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these databases list common side effects such as dizziness, headache, cough, excessive tiredness and decrease in sexual ability. Nowhere in such lists are there numbers to give a patient an idea of how likely such complications may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where Does the Drug Side Effect Information REALLY Come From and Is It Trustworthy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical manufacturers conduct randomized controlled trials (&lt;strong&gt;RCTs&lt;/strong&gt;) to demonstrate that their new drugs are better than placebos. Without that, they don’t get to bring their medications to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RCTs are primarily designed to determine effectiveness.&lt;/strong&gt; Please hit your internal pause button for just a sec. Reread that sentence. Drug companies care about drug &lt;em&gt;effectiveness&lt;/em&gt;…a lot! If they can’t prove their “marvelous” new medicine is better than placebo, they are usually out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the FDA sometimes bends its own rules a bit and approves a drug that barely demonstrates effectiveness. You can read about one such example &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/new-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-breakthrough-or-boondoggle"&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;. In theory, though, the FDA is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; supposed to approve any medication that does not work better than nothing (placebo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug companies are also required to collect information about side effects. But that is where the system gets squirrelly!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gathering Drug Side Effect Information:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are numerous ways this kind of information is gathered. The specific choices a study sponsor makes can have an important impact on our understanding of the drug’s risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps the researchers need to take in planning their trial is to decide who will be included (and, just as critical, who gets excluded). Until several decades ago, many trials didn’t include women. Scientists didn’t want to have to deal with potential variables such as menstrual cycles or pregnancy. At the same time, they just assumed that side effects would be the same—an assumption that hasn’t always been substantiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study subjects may also be younger or healthier than the patients who will eventually be taking the medication. This simplifies the study, because the researchers don’t have to take multiple health conditions and additional medications into account. But it may also limit the usefulness of the side effect information gathered from the clinical trial. The real world is messy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another pitfall at the planning phase is how many people will be included. Clinical trials are expensive, so often they do not include enough subjects to be likely to reveal a rare or even uncommon reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the actual process by which pharmaceutical companies collect drug side effect information. There is substantial variability in the way questions are asked about adverse drug reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Do Drug Companies Ask Questions?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I were to ask you if you have experienced a headache recently, what would you say? A lot of people experience headaches on a regular basis. Once you stop to think about it, you might easily say yes. Ditto for indigestion or trouble sleeping or diarrhea. The very act of asking about a symptom can trigger a positive response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a researcher informs subjects in a clinical trial that the drug being tested is capable of causing headaches, indigestion, insomnia and diarrhea, the volunteers might very well be super vigilant for such complications. Even if they were to get the placebo, they would be primed to report one or more of those side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the data are analyzed, the company might report that the volunteers getting active drug complained of headaches &lt;strong&gt;7%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time. The participants in the placebo group noted headaches &lt;strong&gt;6.8%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time. The conclusion might be that there is &lt;em&gt;no difference&lt;/em&gt; between the two groups and that the drug does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cause headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that would be false; the placebo group was primed to report such an adverse reaction. To read more about this flaw in the system, check out &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/randomized-controlled-trials-rcts-a-flawed-gold-standard"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. It discusses a landmark study by Dr. Jerry Avorn and colleagues involving antidepressant medications. It was published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19810776/"&gt;Drug Safety&lt;/a&gt; in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comparing Drug Side Effect Information for 2 Identical Drugs (Ozempic and Wegovy):&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have, no doubt, heard about the GLP-1 agonist drugs &lt;strong&gt;Ozempic&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Wegovy&lt;/strong&gt;. They are both semaglutide. Ozempic was approved for diabetes and Wegovy was approved for weight loss. From our perspective, the clinical trials should have produced somewhat similar side effect profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official prescribing information reports that &lt;strong&gt;20.3%&lt;/strong&gt; of the patients on Ozempic complained of nausea while only &lt;strong&gt;6.1%&lt;/strong&gt; of those on placebo reported nausea. Contrast that with the identical medicine Wegovy: &lt;strong&gt;42%&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;44%&lt;/strong&gt; of subjects on Wegovy reported nausea. Those getting placebo shots of Wegovy reported nausea &lt;strong&gt;16-18%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop. Reflect! We are comparing nausea from placebo to nausea from placebo. Those getting placebo injections in the Wegovy trial had about &lt;strong&gt;3 times&lt;/strong&gt; the incidence of nausea than those getting placebo injections in the Ozempic trials. Smells kind of fishy, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diarrhea was even more bizarre. Those getting &lt;strong&gt;placebo&lt;/strong&gt; shots in the Ozempic clinical trials reported diarrhea &lt;strong&gt;1.9%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time. The subjects getting &lt;strong&gt;placebo&lt;/strong&gt; shots in the Wegovy clinical trial reported diarrhea &lt;strong&gt;16-19%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time. That’s about a &lt;strong&gt;10 fold&lt;/strong&gt; difference. We’re talking placebo compared to placebo. It should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be different! Or, if there were a psychological factor at work, it should not have been &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; different! We think there is a BIG problem with how such side effect information is collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overlooking Adverse Drug Reactions!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another very serious flaw in the way pharmaceutical companies collect drug side effect information. If they do not “catch” an adverse reaction during the smallish preliminary phase 2 safety studies, they are not likely to look for an adverse reaction during the major clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, prescribers don’t always recognize this shortcoming. We can’t tell you how often a reader has written to say that their physician dismissed a problem with the drug because he or she couldn’t find the side effect listed in the prescribing information. Yet adverse effects often crop up &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; after drug approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prozac and Sexual Side Effects!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example of this is the antidepressant fluoxetine (&lt;strong&gt;Prozac&lt;/strong&gt;). When the FDA first approved this drug for depression, the prescribing information suggested that a relatively small number of people (3%) might have sexual difficulties while taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little by little, patients and their doctors began to realize that was a serious underestimate. As many as half of patients on fluoxetine in one study had reduced libido, erectile dysfunction or trouble achieving orgasm (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23538970/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease&lt;/em&gt;, April 2013&lt;/a&gt;). In other studies of healthy individuals, the rate rose as high as 80 percent (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31591339/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, Oct. 7, 2019&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of adverse drug reaction is not one people are eager to discuss, so if the study supervisors waited for spontaneous reports, they could have missed the signal on what turned out to be a common rather than a rare side effect. Early clinical trials usually don’t catch suicidal thoughts and acts either. It seems counterintuitive that a drug for depression might trigger suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Examples of Missed Drug Side Effect information:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Statins and Blood Sugar:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot tell you how many times clinical trials completely missed catching serious drug side effects. Statin-type cholesterol-lowering drugs can raise blood sugar. People with diabetes may also have a harder time controlling their blood glucose when put on a statin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our readers told us about these complications in 2002, long before the FDA or the companies discovered them. You can read the sad saga &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/do-statins-cause-or-aggravate-type-2-diabetes"&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Zolpidem and GERD:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our readers alerted us to heartburn associated with the sleeping pill zolpidem (&lt;strong&gt;Ambien&lt;/strong&gt;). The official prescribing information lists “gastroesophageal reflux disease” (GERD) and abdominal discomfort at 1%. Judging from reports from our readers, though, the incidence could be significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cetirizine and Rebound Itching:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had to arm wrestle the FDA to look into rebound itching when people stop the antihistamines cetirizine (&lt;strong&gt;Zyrtec&lt;/strong&gt;) or levocetirizine (&lt;strong&gt;Xyzal&lt;/strong&gt;). This complication was not discovered during clinical trials of these allergy meds. There is no warning on the OTC labels of these antihistamines. You can read about &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/cetirizine-zyrtec-withdrawal-unbearable-itching"&gt;this problem here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 16, 2025, the FDA issued a warning about cetirizine (Zyrtec) and levocetirizine (Xyzal). Here is the headline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“What safety concern is FDA announcing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that patients stopping the oral allergy medicines &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;cetirizine (Zyrtec) or levocetirizine (Xyzal) after long-term use may experience rare but severe itching. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;These medicines are available in prescription and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;over-the-counter (OTC) forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;. The itching, also called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;pruritus, has been reported in patients who used these medicines daily, typically for at least a few &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;months and often for years. Patients did not experience itching before starting the medicines. Reported &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;cases were rare but sometimes serious, with patients experiencing widespread, severe itching that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;required medical intervention. As a result, we are revising the prescription cetirizine and levocetirizine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;prescribing information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; to include a new warning about this risk. We will subsequently request that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;manufacturers add a warning about pruritus to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Drug Facts Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; of the OTC versions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fluoroquinolones (FQs) &amp;amp; Tendons &amp;amp; So Much More:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tongue twister fluoroquinolones (&lt;strong&gt;FQs&lt;/strong&gt;) may not be familiar to you. These are antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (&lt;strong&gt;Cipro&lt;/strong&gt;) or levofloxacin (&lt;strong&gt;Levaquin&lt;/strong&gt;). They used to be prescribed regularly for sinusitis, cystitis, prostatitis, bronchitis and skin infections. They were perceived as highly effective and quite safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long after these drugs were approved and prescribed promiscuously, it was discovered that they could cause devastating complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;These include:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…disabling and potentially permanent side effects of the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…disturbances in attention, disorientation, agitation, nervousness, memory impairment and delirium. In addition, the FDA is concerned about the potential for hypoglycemic coma. This occurs when blood sugar levels drop precipitously. Hypoglycemic coma is a potentially life-threatening complication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started asking the FDA about FQ dangers to the heart and the aorta in 2014. That’s because readers had alerted us to the risk of aortic aneurysms and other serious vascular complications. There was nothing in the prescribing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;It took the FDA until December 20, 2018 to warn that FQ antibiotics were linked to :&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ruptures or tears in the main artery of the body, called the aorta. These tears, called aortic dissections, or ruptures of an aortic aneurysm can lead to dangerous bleeding or even death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can You Rely Upon Drug Side Effect Information?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on citing example after example, but you should be fed up by now. The bottom line of this article is that you may not be able to rely on official prescribing information when assessing possible side effects of your medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA does not seem terribly concerned about the ways drug companies have been able to manipulate the collection of adverse drug reaction data. Norwegian researchers describe “biases in reporting of adverse effects in clinical trials” in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36125975/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic &amp;amp; Clinical Pharmacology &amp;amp; Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;, Dec. 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The authors report that:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of common definitions and monitoring methods for adverse effects is likely to be valid across all medical areas and is potentially a large source of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bias may be expected if study design is suboptimal, patient monitoring not clearly defined, outcomes diffuse, and reporting selective. For readers, absence of relevant data may be difficult to notice unless an article is subjected to close scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings confirm the results of other researchers and show considerable pitfalls in identification and reporting of adverse effects in clinical trials. Some biases are caused by methods choices including study design and patient monitoring, and others are caused by use of thresholds, filters, and selective reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One Final Example:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV drug commercials are especially vexing. An announcer speeds through a long list of adverse reactions. For example, an ad for &lt;strong&gt;Rinvoq&lt;/strong&gt; to treat rheumatoid arthritis includes these warnings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Rinvoq can lower your ability to fight infections, including tuberculosis. Serious infections and blood clots, sometimes fatal, have occurred, as have certain cancers, including lymphoma, and tears in the stomach or intestines and changes in lab results.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scary information is crucial but does not tell patients how common these side effects may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Can You Do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cannot rely on the FDA-approved information found in &lt;a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/"&gt;DailyMed&lt;/a&gt;, then you certainly cannot rely upon the drug side effect information found during an online search. Remember, everything traces back to the official prescribing information. If that is flawed, then all the databases are equally flawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can you do? First, trust your body. If you suspect an adverse reaction to a medicine and it is not listed as a drug side effect, you may be right and the official prescribing information may be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discuss your concerns with your doctor. If she dismisses the problem because it is not listed in her drug side effect information, point her to this article. It just might convince your doctor that her computerized drug database is not all it’s cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please share your thoughts in the comment section below. If you have ever experienced a drug side effect that was not “officially” recognized, please relate your story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe this article contains important information, why not send it along to friends, family and health professionals? That’s super easy. Just scroll to the top of the page and click on the icons for email or social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will not find this kind of in-depth analysis of drug side effect information anyplace else. If you appreciate our independent voice, why not encourage your contacts to subscribe to our free online newsletter &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/subscribe"&gt;at this link?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know everyone is asking for money these days.

recorded more than double the number of Lyme disease cases in 2024 as it did in 2020 - 7,200 compared to 3,110. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And so far this year, the state health department has reported 1,517 cases of tick-borne illnesses and 349 tick-related emergency room visits from January 1 to May 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an increase from 288 hospital visits during the same time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person contracts Lyme disease from the bite of an infected black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, which is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13468953/Worst-states-tick-borne-illnesses.html"&gt;a common species in the Northeast and Midwest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lyme disease signs usually begin with the hallmark 'bullseye' rash that has red rings around the original bite site. If left untreated people may experience flu-like symptoms like a headache, muscle pains and aches and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe untreated cases of Lyme disease can cause facial paralysis, vision changes and issues with memory and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A person contracts Lyme disease from the bite of an infected black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, pictured above (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lyme disease cases in the US are on the rise, with cases hitting a high of of 89,470 in 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness is easier to treat when caught early and doctors typically prescribe a 28-day regimen of antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, because of the non-specific symptoms of Lyme disease, many cases can go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally, ticks must be attached to a person for at least 24 hours in order to transmit the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Performing tick checks after possible exposure is vital to quickly identify if you've been bitten and to remove the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer ticks are common in northeastern and midwestern states, such as Connecticut, New York, Minnesota and Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC, which has Lyme disease data through 2023, shows New Jersey had the fourth-highest number of Lyme disease cases that year, falling behind New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It recorded 7,224 cases. New York saw 22,170 cases; Pennsylvania reported 16,670; and Massachusetts reported 9,715. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the US is seeing a record number of Lyme disease cases - recording 89,470 cases in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease area is also expanding.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map of where Lyme disease cases were reported in the US in 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map of where Lyme disease cases were reported in the US in 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map of where Lyme disease cases were reported in the US in 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent testing on human and tick samples suggests millions more Americans could be at risk because the tick that causes Lyme disease is spreading to new geographical areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts don't know exactly why the tick is traveling, but some posit it is due to development or climate change, and cases could be on the rise because of increased education and awareness surrounding ticks and Lyme disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid Lyme disease, it is important to wear long sleeves and long pants to prevent ticks from being able to attach themselves to your skin and perform thorough tick checks after spending time in the outdoors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You can also wear repellant and treat clothing with acaricides, special pesticides used to kill ticks and mites.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ticks can also infect animals, so it is important to check pets for the parasites or signs of a bite and give them preventatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you do find a tick, use tweezers to remove it and save it so it can be identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We asked experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-motion-sickness" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is motion sickness?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Motion sickness is a generic term that encompasses all sorts of travel sickness, including sea sickness, air sickness and car sickness, says Dr John Golding, professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster, in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But you don’t need to travel to experience its unpleasant symptoms, which can include nausea, vomiting, burping, drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and blurred vision. When the Lumière brothers first screened a motion picture for the public in 1895, some people in the audience started feeling dizzy and sick, says Golding. This is known as “visually induced motion sickness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="dc137228-1ee0-4d21-bf7f-08a6dc5c4f4e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Athletes and fitness influencers use creatine, but what is it?

Your body uses visual stimuli, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/18/the-power-of-proprioception-how-to-improve-your-sixth-sense-and-become-healthier-and-happier" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;proprioception&lt;/a&gt; (the body’s ability to perceive itself in space) and the vestibular system (structures inside the inner ear that help you maintain a sense of balance) to sense where your body is and how it is moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Usually, these three mechanisms are in sync. But when one of them isn’t – say, you’re reading a static page in the car, but your vestibular system still senses that you’re moving – this sensory conflict confuses the brain. “This neurological tension is what triggers common symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and vomiting,” explains Dr Safia Debar, a general practitioner and executive health physician at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the case of the Lumière brothers’ first audiences, their vestibular systems and senses of proprioception told them they were still, but their eyes told them they were moving. Today, many people experience this sort of visually induced motion sickness when using virtual-reality headsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-kinds-of-movements-cause-motion-sickness" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What kinds of movements cause motion sickness?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One of the most common misconceptions about motion sickness is that the strength of the movement determines the severity of the reaction, says Golding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But people don’t tend to get motion sickness when they’re bouncing up and down on horseback; that is a “higher frequency” movement, says Golding. Slower-frequency movements, like the rocking of a ship at sea, or the swaying of a bus, are more likely to result in motion sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-do-some-people-experience-motion-sickness-more-than-others" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why do some people experience motion sickness more than others?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So why can one person read endlessly in a car while even a quick glimpse at a phone turns another person green?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A number of factors seem to influence one’s proneness to motion sickness, says Dr Behrang Keshavarz, senior scientist at the Kite Research Institute and professor in the department of psychology at Toronto Metropolitan University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One is age: motion sickness tends to peak in children between the ages of 8 and 12. “Adults are usually better than kids with motion sickness,” says Keshavarz. But that’s not true for everyone, he clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Research suggests people assigned female at birth are more likely to experience motion sickness than those assigned male at birth, says Keshavarz, though no one’s quite sure why. Genetics may also play a role, says Golding, adding that studies indicate motion sickness might be 50-70% heritable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"d493857e-ede7-4ad1-8084-f39fbf3be02b","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="d493857e-ede7-4ad1-8084-f39fbf3be02b" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some individuals may also be better at adapting to strange new motions than others, suggests Dr Thomas A Stoffregen, emeritus professor of kinesiology at the University of Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some people are ‘naturally coordinated’ and can learn new motor skills quickly,” he says over email. “Others (like me) are klutzes and take forever to learn new movements.” The latter are more at risk for motion sickness, he argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-21" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(I would like to see this printed on the little airplane vomit bags I so often end up breathing into during landings.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s not about being delicate or anxious,” says Debar. “Some people are simply more sensitive to motion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About half of novice astronauts get space sick during training, Golding adds. “They’re very fit, very highly motivated and not weak-willed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I nod.

Sit in the front seat of a car when you can, keep your eyes on the horizon, and avoid reading and screens, says Debar. She also notes that ginger has some natural anti-nausea effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pleasant music, fresh air, nice smells and a generally pleasant ambiance may be able to distract you, says Keshavarz. He also suggests car passengers copy the movements of the driver. Drivers rarely get motion sickness because they can anticipate the movements of the car and lean into turns, for example. “If you mimic what the driver does, that helps,” Keshavarz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unfortunately, the most effective way to combat motion sickness is also the least pleasant: habituation. In other words, doing the activity over and over again until it doesn’t give you motion sickness anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is by far the most effective countermeasure,” says Golding, who used it to help desensitize Royal Air Force pilots to air sickness. “It doesn’t have side effects, but it’s very time consuming and can be stimulus specific,” he says – meaning that habituating to car sickness won’t necessarily help you with sea sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over-the-counter anti-nausea medication can be effective, experts say, but they often cause drowsiness. Transdermal patches such as Scopolamine are also helpful for up to three days, but can take six to 10 hours to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Timing is important for such medications, says Golding. Even pills might take 30 minutes to an hour to take effect. And you must take them before you start to feel sick, because once you start to experience motion sickness, your stomach goes into gastric stasis, meaning it is no longer emptying its contents into the gut. “That means you might have taken the pill, but it’s not going anywhere,” says Golding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Finally, you can always “vote with your feet”, says Golding. “Avoid situations where you get sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOSHZLUldIT1puQXN1NFZ3OUdDdThPYjN4NjZGVE8wWF8yTk1xRXhNcEUxS3dyR3M3ZE91V0RScDF6WTdHQ1JXeWxqSGctdUVHdTJvN0JYOUpCWXNuOFZ6MzZ0bUtZWVZFVkx0VmZIZXdhSkZfbEpCWnd6RndhRGJBVFNR</guid></item><item><title>马萨诸塞州布里格姆将军的研究发现，常见的止痛药可能会延长脑癌患者的生存期-《波士顿环球报》 | Common pain drug may prolong survival for brain cancer patients, Mass General Brigham study finds - The Boston Globe</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxONUU3eVJJSGF0TWdaZF9rYVBOLW5IajdKQ3hkNTJUQkRvcFR3Ni11b1E4cWc4eHA2Q3B1bi10UWRSNndGd1dxbjk2RzY1aUtBNGtobEdSei0zeFBwODJLNjVmMUxyWENVQ0hYelJNaTExSVRYRnFuTnZSMnRqUUREMEktdmJOQjdrZ0FzRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="lead | border_box gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet relative"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A widely prescribed medication may offer new hope for patients battling glioblastoma, an aggressive tumor that accounts for the majority of malignant brain cancers in adults and carries one of the bleakest prognoses in oncology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Patients who took gabapentin — a drug commonly used to treat nerve pain and seizures — lived several months longer than those who didn’t, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59614-4" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59614-4"&gt;a new study published this week in Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The findings come from a retrospective analysis by research teams at Mass General Brigham and the University of California, San Francisco. Glioblastoma affects about 12,000 Americans each year, and despite ongoing research, survival rates have barely improved: most patients die within 12 to 14 months of diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The idea for the study emerged from its lead author, Dr. Joshua Bernstock, and what he called his “emerging obsession” with cancer neuroscience — a growing field that examines how tumors manipulate the nervous system to grow and survive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In 2023, researchers on the West Coast published a study showing that gliomas — a broad category of brain tumors that includes glioblastoma — integrate into neural circuits and use a protein called thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) to fuel their growth. Bernstock knew that gabapentin was shown in earlier research to interfere with TSP-1 activity, and was struck by the potential implications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I looked at it three times the day it came out and said, ‘Oh my God,’” said Bernstock, a clinical fellow in neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “This wasn’t some novel experimental therapy. This was something already on the shelf, already being prescribed to patients.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bernstock’s team combed through the medical records of 693 glioblastoma patients treated at Mass General Brigham. Many had been prescribed gabapentin to treat chronic nerve pain. Those patients had a median survival of 16 months — four months longer than those not on the drug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To test whether the trend held up elsewhere, the team partnered with UC San Francisco researchers who reviewed data from 379 additional patients. Their results showed an even greater gap: patients taking gabapentin lived 20.8 months on average, compared to 14.7 months for those who didn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bernstock emphasized that while the findings are promising, only a randomized clinical trial can confirm gabapentin’s true effect. But the biology supports the hypothesis. Patients who took gabapentin showed lower levels of TSP-1 in their blood, and the team controlled for as many confounding variables as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We know it’s biologically plausible,” Bernstock said. “That, plus the drop in serum [found in blood] TSP-1, makes us think this is the probable mechanism.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He hopes the data will justify launching prospective trials — some of which are already in the early stages of recruitment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Glioblastoma’s resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, combined with its highly heterogeneous nature — meaning no two tumors are exactly alike, even within the same patient — has stalled progress for decades and made breakthroughs rare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This is just such a challenging disease,” Bernstock said. “Gradual steps forward are going to be meaningful.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Even a few extra months can be life-changing for patients and their families.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You haven’t seen these people in clinic,” Bernstock said. “You’ve never had a father who wants to see his daughter graduate, or a mom who wants to help get the family’s affairs in order before she passes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Those human stories, he added, are what drives him to keep searching for new answers in the lab. “It’s actually horrifying to sit across from someone and know you can’t help them with what’s conventionally available,” he said. “That’s what motivates me to keep pushing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

However, the protein craze could mean we’re eating too much for our own good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s always been trends around foods that are extreme,” physiologist George Wells, Ph.D., told &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;. “We had low fat, then low sugar, and now we happen to have high protein. The extremes tend to catch people’s attention. But they’re not good for us and they never last.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the protein craze, we’re pushing an important nutrient to the side: fiber. Accredited Practicing Dietitian Kim Lindsay says fiber is ignored because carbohydrates have been demonized and feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When there's a trend towards a low-carb, higher protein, if we're reducing the amount of carbohydrates that we're eating, we're going to naturally reduce the amount of fiber that we're taking in, right?” Lindsay explained. “We have to have a balanced &lt;a href="/topic/diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; where we include plant foods, protein-containing foods, and fats in our diet.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, balance is being pushed aside for protein-rich eggs, meat and seafood. Snacks previously called “junk food” are getting a wellness makeover, with added protein now found in many bars, chips and gummies. Even the Kardashians are on board, with Khloe Kardashian recently &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJEfXdrpOO_/"&gt;launching her protein popcorn&lt;/a&gt;, “Kloud,” which offers seven grams of protein per one cup of popcorn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://foodinsight.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-IFIC-Food-Health-Survey.pdf"&gt;The International Food Information Council’s annual survey&lt;/a&gt; found that 71 percent of consumers were trying to increase their protein intake this year, a 6 percent rise from 2023. The survey also found that exposure to food and nutrition content online, much of which is protein focused, is up by 54 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, protein is an essential macronutrient to help bodily functions, like fighting infection, providing energy, and building and maintaining muscle mass. Intake depends on body weight, with general guidance being that a just over a third of the calories we consume each day should come from protein. So, with the average American woman weighing around 171 pounds, she should consume about 62 grams of protein a day. The average American man, at around 200 pounds, should eat about 72 grams of protein daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 dcuwoN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-84388"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;(Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Wells believes that due to social media, we’re only focused on having as much protein as possible. “I think the craze around protein right now probably is linked to bodybuilding and the obsession with body composition — looking like you have the six-pack abs,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that ignores the flip side. “If you have too much protein, it's really hard for the body to deal with all of the amino acids that are floating around,” Wells added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where fiber comes in handy. Typically found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, fiber is particularly beneficial to your digestive system and keeping you regular. While men should have about 38 grams a day and women should have 25 grams, as noted by dietitian Kristin Kirkpatrick, you shouldn’t just jump into doing that if you’ve been eating way less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber intake should be tailored to the individual and the microbiome. However, if you are well under this amount, you should go slow to allow the body adequate time to adjust,” Kirkpatrick, the owner of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kristinkirkpatrick.com/"&gt;KAK nutrition consulting,&lt;/a&gt; explained. She added that fiber can also prevent certain cancers and type 2 diabetes and improve heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 gTGbNB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-84389"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;(Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational studies have found a fiber deficiency among Americans. According to a study published in &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6124841/#bibr10-1559827615588079"&gt;the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, only five percent of the population has the recommended amount of fiber a day. Inadequate intake can result in health issues like chronic constipation and gastrointestinal problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to avoiding high-processed foods just because they’ve got extra protein added to them, we should focus on eating real foods that are naturally high in fiber rather than ultra-processed foods with bits of fiber in them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We gravitate towards highly processed foods because they're engineered to taste fantastic,” Wells said. ”They're high in sugar and salts, and we crave them as a result. There’s no real incentive for the processed foods to be satiating. They're great for business, but they're really not very good for our health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 15:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOVWJ1d3h3MkxQYUJIbjFoNDlaRFpJZlFwNXhPbkRnOFV3eE9aaXlSZ1l4YWY4MEY3V3VZcEFBR25WVFB0dlg2WEYxc1pXdVhSMkhOcUl2bEYyMGZQN0ZsMGUxTU9ub1FUWHhWaUVtTEk3Qkd5b1N6V2sxSDlmNlRiTTBiSVM3dEhtRGg0OGpFVjU4SVdqZERDNy1CMGVyRDh3dmsxSlMxeGJMY2dPdmZJ</guid></item><item><title>想活到115岁吗？以下是研究表明您应该做的事情-神经科学新闻 | Want to Live to 115?

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it isn’t usually a good idea to take health and longevity advice from supercentenarians (as they’re often the exception rather than the rule), there are some lifestyle pointers that we can take from research on groups of long-lived people that might help us increase our chances of living a longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Physical activity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is good for you – who knew? Research shows that people who are more physically active each day tend to live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study found that going from no physical activity to about 75 minutes per week of brisk walking increased life expectancy by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23139642/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;about two years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps less well known is just how bad inactivity is for your health and longevity. It’s a tad difficult to explain, but the positive effects of exercise are actually different from the negative effects of inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that you can have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3419586/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;positive influence on your health&lt;/a&gt; by being both more active and avoiding being inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet as good as structured exercise is for you, it can’t by itself offset the harms of inactivity and sitting all day. Research even shows that being sedentary is associated with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38410939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher risk of premature death&lt;/a&gt; from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to live longer, you should try to avoid sitting for long periods of time if possible. Practical tips for this include standing up every 30 minutes, going to see someone in the office instead of calling or emailing them and standing on public transport during commuting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, plus the aim to do about 30 minutes moderate exercise most days will help maximise your odds of a long, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Eat your veggies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice many kids dread: eat your vegetables if you want to live a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40128348/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; that followed around 100,000 people over a 30 year period found that people who made it to 70 years of age in good health (meaning they had no chronic diseases) typically ate more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, and fewer trans-fats, red or processed meats, fried foods and sugary foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this study doesn’t say that you must be a vegan, or never eat red meats – it only identifies trends within diets associated with healthy ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When and how much you eat may also play a role when it comes to ageing. Research on caloric restriction and intermittent fasting in animals has shown both can increase lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our preliminary work in humans has also shown that following a fasting diet for three weeks can cause &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10650498/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;similar, positive metabolic shifts&lt;/a&gt; that match what we’ve seen in animals that will live longer. However, larger studies over longer time-frames are needed to establish effects on healthspan and lifespan in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular, good quality sleep is also important for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37831896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lifelong health and overall longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study of about 500,000 British people, irregular sleep patterns were associated with a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37995126/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;50% higher risk of early death&lt;/a&gt; compared to those with regular sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shift workers showed higher risk for strokes, and nurses who worked rotating shifts for decades were &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9069254/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;less healthy and had earlier deaths&lt;/a&gt; at retirement compared to nurses who didn’t work shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this data suggests that good quality, regular sleep is important for good health, how much sleep you need and when you should go to bed &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8063933/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;appears to be highly individualistic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes giving population-wide recommendations difficult – which is why the NHS recommends adults get between 7-9 hours sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress has many effects on your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, increasing evidence shows that early-life stressors (such as loss of a parent, neglect or abuse) can negatively affect health later in life – even down to a molecular and cellular level by &lt;a href="https://karger.com/nim/article/32/1/24/916732/A-Brief-Historic-Review-of-Research-on-Early-Life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;increasing inflammation levels&lt;/a&gt; in ways that could increase the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6146930/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risk of poor health and premature death in older age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, older adults that show increased psychological resilience to stress are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39054517/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;less likely to die from any cause&lt;/a&gt;. As little as eight weeks of regular yoga is enough to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596549/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;improve psychological resilience&lt;/a&gt; in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly linked is the effect of social connections. Those that live more socially active lives also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11872968/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tend to live longer&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, people over 65 who are socially active daily are &lt;a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/77/5/277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;three times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to live for five more years compared to those that almost never engage in social activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a common finding that strong social networks appear to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473615/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;enhance longevity&lt;/a&gt;. This may be due to the way social connections help us alleviate stressors in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The role of genetics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are many lifestyle habits we can change, one thing we can’t control when it comes to our lifespans is genetics. Some research suggests that naturally-occurring mutations in genes associated with longevity are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20868776/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more common in long-lived people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s hard to tease out the role of genetics versus lifestyle when it comes to lifespan, current predictions suggest that longevity is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16708071/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;between 20-40%&lt;/a&gt; related to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28689042/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But good genetics aren’t everything. Although Ethel Caterham has made it to the remarkable age of 115 – and one of her sisters lived to be 104 – Caterham’s two daughters pre-deceased her at 71 and 83 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even if you do win the genetic jackpot and follow a good lifestyle, you would still be very lucky to make it to Caterham’s grand old age of 115. Cells mutate, clots form, biological luck runs out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, if you want to maximise your odds of living longer and staying as healthy as possible, aim to be more physically active each day, eat a good diet, get a good night’s sleep and keep stress levels low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this longevity and aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/bradley-elliott-1014864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bradley Elliott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bradley Elliott – The Conversation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255789/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 15:26:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5NcHYtcnlkNVhKRDhHeFBUZ3B4anhfaXJwc08xTUV2ZFBBdmd2LXRsRFlpU3hDUFNnTENKR1VCN1VoazNIanZYNEFyRXdaenlTUl9jMXJYQVBqNjM5Z1pCVTZsdUp0bmpWaGdBemJwUG8</guid></item><item><title>重新布线记忆：像人脑一样学习的新模型-神经科学新闻 | Rewiring Memory: A New Model That Learns Like a Human Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXkFVX3lxTE9rMm9qTXRTNENLbVNxZWtuOGZNWjZQeWdXRjVOeDRSWk81NWwySFlmc3k1TnBMNGZNaW5KMjF0MFBManVPN19COFlWdWlILWpkUzNTSVpobS1KanJqeUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new memory model called Input-Driven Plasticity (IDP) offers a more human-like explanation for how external stimuli help us retrieve memories, building on the foundations of the classic Hopfield network. Unlike traditional models, which assume memory recall happens from a fixed starting point, the IDP framework describes how stimuli reshape the brain’s “energy landscape” in real time to guide memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic approach better reflects how we remember things in real life, like recognizing a cat from just its tail. The model is also robust to noise, filtering out weak memories in favor of stable, meaningful ones, offering insights for future AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Memory Retrieval:&lt;/strong&gt; The IDP model suggests that external stimuli reshape the neural landscape as memories are retrieved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise-Resilient Design:&lt;/strong&gt; It uses environmental “noise” to filter out unstable memories, improving robustness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; This model could inspire more memory-capable AI systems that go beyond static inputs and mimic human associative recall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Santa Barbara&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to the first notes of an old, beloved song.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a network effect,” said UC Santa Barbara mechanical engineering professor Francesco Bullo, explaining that associative memories aren’t stored in single brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memory storage and memory retrieval are dynamic processes that occur over entire networks of neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1982 physicist John Hopfield translated this theoretical neuroscience concept into the artificial intelligence realm, with the formulation of the Hopfield network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, not only did he provide a mathematical framework for understanding memory storage and retrieval in the human brain, he also developed one of the first recurrent artificial neural networks — the Hopfield network — known for its ability to retrieve complete patterns from noisy or incomplete inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopfield won the Nobel Prize for his work in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to Bullo and collaborators Simone Betteti, Giacomo Baggio and Sandro Zampieri at the University of Padua in Italy, the traditional Hopfield network model is powerful, but it doesn’t tell the full story of how new information guides memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Notably,” they say in a paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, “the role of external inputs has largely been unexplored, from their effects on neural dynamics to how they facilitate effective memory retrieval.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest a model of memory retrieval they say is more descriptive of how we experience memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The modern version of machine learning systems, these large language models — they don’t really model memories,” Bullo explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You put in a prompt and you get an output. But it’s not the same way in which we understand and handle memories in the animal world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While LLMs can return responses that can sound convincingly intelligent, drawing upon the patterns of the language they are fed, they still lack the underlying reasoning and experience of the physical real world that animals have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way in which we experience the world is something that is more continuous and less start-and-reset,” said Betteti, lead author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the treatments on the Hopfield model tended to treat the brain as if it was a computer, he added, with a very mechanistic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, since we are working on a memory model, we want to start with a human perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main question inspiring the theorists was: As we experience the world that surrounds us, how do the signals we receive enable us to retrieve memories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hopfield envisioned, it helps to conceptualize memory retrieval in terms of an energy landscape, in which the valleys are energy minima that represent memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory retrieval is like exploring this landscape; recognition is when you fall into one of the valleys. Your starting position in the landscape is your initial condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine you see a cat’s tail,” Bullo said. “Not the entire cat, but just the tail. An associative memory system should be able to recover the memory of the entire cat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the traditional Hopfield model, the cat’s tail (stimulus) is enough to put you closest to the valley labeled “cat,” he explained, treating the stimulus as an initial condition. But how did you get to that spot in the first place? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The classic Hopfield model does not carefully explain how seeing the tail of the cat puts you in the right place to fall down the hill and reach the energy minimum,” Bullo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you move around in the space of neural activity where you are storing these memories? It’s a little bit unclear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ Input-Driven Plasticity (IDP) model aims to address this lack of clarity with a mechanism that gradually integrates past and new information, guiding the memory retrieval process to the correct memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of applying the two-step algorithmic memory retrieval on the rather static energy landscape of the original Hopfield network model, the researchers describe a dynamic, input-driven mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We advocate for the idea that as the stimulus from the external world is received (e.g., the image of the cat tail), it changes the energy landscape at the same time,” Bullo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The stimulus simplifies the energy landscape so that no matter what your initial position, you will roll down to the correct memory of the cat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the researchers say, the IDP model is robust to noise — situations where the input is vague, ambiguous, or partially obscured — and in fact uses the noise as a means to filter out less stable memories (the shallower valleys of this energy landscape) in favor of the more stable ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We start with the fact that when you’re gazing at a scene your gaze shifts in between the different components of the scene,” Betteti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So at every instant in time you choose what you want to focus on but you have a lot of noise around.” Once you lock into the input to focus on, the network adjusts itself to prioritize it, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing what stimulus to focus on, a.k.a. attention, is also the main mechanism behind another neural network architecture, the transformer, which has become the heart of large language models like ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the IDP model the researchers propose “starts from a very different initial point with a different aim,” Bullo said, there’s a lot of potential for the model to be helpful in designing future machine learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see a connection between the two, and the paper describes it,” Bullo said. “It is not the main focus of the paper, but there is this wonderful hope that these associative memory systems and large language models may be reconciled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#592a36373038773f3c2b3738373d3c23192c3a2a3b773c3d2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sonia Fernandez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsb.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Santa Barbara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sonia Fernandez – UC Santa Barbara&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adu6991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Input-Driven Dynamics for Robust Memory Retrieval in Hopfield Networks&lt;/a&gt;” by Francesco Bullo et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input-Driven Dynamics for Robust Memory Retrieval in Hopfield Networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hopfield model provides a mathematical framework for understanding the mechanisms of memory storage and retrieval in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model has inspired decades of research on learning and retrieval dynamics, capacity estimates, and sequential transitions among memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the role of external inputs has been largely underexplored, from their effects on neural dynamics to how they facilitate effective memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bridge this gap, we propose a dynamical system framework in which the external input directly influences the neural synapses and shapes the energy landscape of the Hopfield model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plasticity-based mechanism provides a clear energetic interpretation of the memory retrieval process and proves effective at correctly classifying mixed inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we integrate this model within the framework of modern Hopfield architectures to elucidate how current and past information are combined during the retrieval process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, we embed both the classic and the proposed model in an environment disrupted by noise and compare their robustness during memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to examine the association between two vitamin D biomarkers (25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and vitamin D-binding protein [DBP], and their related genetic correlates) and the risk of six mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a population-based, case-cohort sample of all individuals born in Denmark between 1981 and 2005. Using Danish health registers with follow-up to Dec 31, 2012, we identified individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, ASD, and anorexia nervosa based on ICD-10 criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a random subcohort from the general population was selected. Based on neonatal dried blood spots, we measured concentrations of 25(OH)D and DBP. Our primary analyses were based on hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI and absolute risks for the six mental disorders according to measured concentrations of 25(OH)D and DBP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As secondary analyses, we examined the association between genetic predictors of 25(OH)D and DBP, and the six mental disorders, and Mendelian randomisation analyses based on published summary statistics for 25(OH)D, DBP, and the six mental disorders. People with lived experience contributed to the development of the guiding hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the total population from the iPSYCH2012 design (n=88 764), which included individuals who developed the six mental disorders, major depressive disorder (n=24 240), bipolar disorder (n=1928), schizophrenia (n=3540), ADHD (n=18 726), ASD (n=16 146), anorexia nervosa (n=3643), and the randomly sampled subcohort (n=30 000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who met a range of inclusion criteria (eg, measured 25[OH]D, DBP or genotype, and predominantly European ancestry), we measured 25(OH)D or DBP in 71 793 individuals (38 118 [53·1%] male and 33 675 [46·9%] female); 65 952 had 25(OH)D and 66 797 the DBP measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant inverse relationships were found between 25(OH)D and schizophrenia (HR 0·82, 95% CI 0·78–0·86), ASD (HR 0·93, 95% CI 0·90–0·96), and ADHD (HR 0·89, 95% CI 0·86–0·92). A significant inverse relationship was found between DBP and schizophrenia (HR 0·84, 95% CI 0·80–0·88).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on polygenic risk scores, higher concentrations of 25(OH)D (adjusted for DBP) were significantly associated with a reduced risk of both ASD and schizophrenia. Analyses based on Mendelian randomisation provided support for a causal association between both lower 25(OH)D and DBP concentrations and an increased risk of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convergent evidence finds that neonatal vitamin D status is associated with an altered risk of mental disorders. Our study supports the hypothesis that optimising neonatal vitamin D status might reduce the incidence of a range of neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Danish National Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 14:33:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE52MEhoeVB1MnpvQWQ3b2tBeHpRSmtEN0hRcGhUdWhCb1l0aEVRT2lnTkg3MVZUWHpJSTI3RjJ1ZjhoM2dMVGhwcWJlLWQtMlRKWlZrV3pnc01JTUptTmt4TlB4SVRsYWJmTlE</guid></item><item><title>维生素B12会损害肾脏吗？定期服用这种补充剂之前需要知道的5件事-印度时报 | Can vitamin B12 damage kidneys? 5 things to know before regularly taking this supplement - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, B12 injections have become trendy. They’re advertised for fatigue, weight loss, and even skin glow. But when used without medical guidance, they can quietly stress the kidneys — especially when high doses enter the bloodstream directly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A single B12 shot can contain 500 to 1000 mcg or more, going straight into circulation, bypassing the digestive filter. If the kidneys are already under strain (which is common with age, diabetes, or high blood pressure), this direct load can be too much to handle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctors usually prescribe B12 shots for genuine deficiencies like pernicious anemia or malabsorption disorders. Without these, relying on shots becomes more of a health experiment than a need.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAJBVV95cUxPVERESi1uems2YmpnSEt1Q3lFY2FuZzczTVp3YTFnYWtLblA5TWtwZnZNaVB4cTlsd1ZZbW5aQnJITUI2Y1Q5YndnTXFUb3lQZGF4QkFsSjdab3doQUhwc0lXelZfR1hJVzBlMmt6dXlZOURMTjBDeGRaYlVTY1Y0Z3hneU54alJaSmxDZEVlaDktRi11T3hvOTRSYVdHb3Y0MW5zY2xmbTlkdXVfM3ZEdmtBQlQ0LV9kdkI4V096MTJSdXpZNDJOek5VS01mX1Qza1JvXzc5dTc5cGZSeFhsaHlrVTI0UVY5aklsUUZhb1Bnd0lsNzVFak5KTGRVdHdfbk1NYnBQejc4d3l4dDJ5SzJLaUnSAZwCQVVfeXFMTjJBbk8wX29lWnlHZ1c0dHdWbzNkcVZmaVlxampKd0ZnQjU4UzZFZFdSNjhRQmVTRW50cXRxLTcxVF9tUXFqT3Z2SzJ6Sm5ySUVHZU03NkJ2c2d4QmxuNHFwNUVHYXlCN2h0NWxDTmFtWVZ2MFRqdm9HOGh3SXZSbnEtb2hFMy1kQXptbXRDYllrWlVmbm1BUGh2dWVYMlZjaFBiaVVia0YweGx4Y2tERWs3bHBNQ1pIRG1Ib21RM29JS2lrX3pZVTc5ek9qR29jbktqOU15amNfaTJVdHI2cjhtWldZOGdxb2JKN0dnM3NHMkY1c2lWQTJyZG4zTEp3dXFxa0RWZ19ZaERJb1RsTnlwcGt2bmZLOEM3dTg</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，如果您患有IBS ，您应该开始的# 1习惯- EatingWell | The #1 Habit You Should Start If You Have IBS, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBCcVBHT2hRUjc2STlzUW5xaHdKUXRWNEMzeXZJNnktX2tQOVZCYkVmZ0Rya0JyNm5NZkRYREJiM2NUczJWOVZDMzhIQ0hPTl9XNU1DdTJOSkVpSVBILVh5YXlsbm5Idm5YSTY3cGpQVVpaRmtKTFFpNDR2V0hjMUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with IBS have uncomfortable digestive symptoms like diarrhea, constipation or both.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To ease discomfort, many people cut out certain foods, robbing them of key nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say a better first step is slowing down during meals to improve digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A diagnosis of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-experts-recommend-when-diagnosed-with-ibs-8746518" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&lt;/a&gt; may have you flipping your diet upside down trying to manage symptoms. “Too many people with IBS start by excluding foods,” says&lt;a href="http://www.guthealthconnection.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Kim Kulp, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Many try cutting out dairy or gluten, and when that doesn’t help, other foods are also eliminated. This can lead to a diet that’s lacking in a variety of nutrients, and still doesn’t manage symptoms.” So, this may not be the most effective first step toward feeling your best. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Instead, dietitians say, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you eat when you have IBS may be as important—if not more important—than &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs-11732962#:~:text=Nutrition%20experts%20agree%20that%20personalized,breathing%20exercises%20and%20eating%20slowly." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;what you eat&lt;/a&gt;. “As a dietitian specializing in IBS, one habit that I am constantly working with clients on is slowing down—especially at mealtimes,” says &lt;a href="https://rootstorisenutrition.com/about-kara/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kara Hochreiter, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. And her colleagues agree. Whether you have IBS-C, IBS-D or mixed IBS, here’s how slowing down while you eat may help improve your IBS symptoms. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-slowing-down-at-mealtimes-may-help-ibs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Slowing Down at Mealtimes May Help IBS &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Can Improve Gut-Brain Communication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re eating in a stressed or rushed state, digestion can take a serious hit, thanks to the strong two-way connection between your gut and your brain. When you’re under stress, your brain shifts energy and blood flow toward vital organs and away from your digestive system. If you eat in this state, your digestion may slow down or become disrupted. Then, your gut sends those stress signals right back to your brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For those who already struggle with IBS symptoms, the effects of stress can be even worse. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Help You Tune into Your Body’s Stress Signals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that people with IBS may be more likely to rush through meals and chew their food less thoroughly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When you’re eating in a rushed, distracted state, your body stays in fight-or-flight mode, which suppresses stomach acid, enzyme production and gut motility. This can result in more bloating, cramping, heartburn and unpredictable bowel movements,” says Hochreiter. Taking the time to slow down when you eat may help you better pick up on these signals before they escalate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, this may be more easily said than done, since experiencing pain and discomfort after eating can likely exacerbate stress. “People with IBS are more likely to experience stress and anxiety around food because they know their history of food and gut symptoms, which continues the cycle of visceral hypersensitivity when eating,” says&lt;a href="http://www.nicoleibarrard.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Nicole Ibarra, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Might Improve Digestion &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Something as simple as limiting distractions, chewing thoroughly and taking a few deep belly breaths before meals can help shift the body into rest-and-digest mode and dramatically reduce symptoms,” says Hochreiter. Planning plenty of time for your meals can also help. While it’s hard to do when you’re busy, dedicating 20 to 30 minutes for each meal may help you feel better after eating. Of course, long-term habits can be hard to break. If you could use more tips to help you slow down, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041411/how-to-eat-slower/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;these strategies can help&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to working closely with your physician or a registered dietitian, experts recommend these top IBS management strategies to feel your best. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep a food-and-symptom journal. &lt;/strong&gt;Journaling what you eat and any symptoms you feel can help you identify potential triggers to better inform you before you start cutting foods out of your diet. “It’s one of the most powerful tools for taking control of symptoms and feeling better day to day,” says &lt;a href="https://healthdownsouth.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jessie Winstead, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated.&lt;/strong&gt; Dehydration can slow digestion and make symptoms like constipation and gas worse. And, if you have IBS-D, staying hydrated is essential for replenishing lost fluids. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid skipping meals.&lt;/strong&gt; Going too long between meals can send your nervous and digestive systems into overdrive. “Eating every three to four hours helps balance [the stress hormone] cortisol and your circadian rhythm, while preventing overeating and impulsively eating foods that are gut-irritating,” says &lt;a href="https://www.thirdeyenourishment.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Keelin Murphy, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add gentle movement.&lt;/strong&gt; Just a 10- to 15-minute walk after a meal can help stimulate digestion and relieve numerous symptoms of IBS. In one small study, a short walk reduced burping, gas and abdominal pain as much as taking gut motility-stimulating medication. Plus, it relieved feelings of bloating and abdominal fullness at an even higher rate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat breakfast.&lt;/strong&gt; “This early meal kick-starts digestion by triggering the gastrocolic reflex, which promotes regular bowel movements and supports smoother gut function all day,” says &lt;a href="https://eatswimwin.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Katie Schimmelpfenning, RD&lt;/a&gt;. “It also provides steady energy and reduces stress on your digestive system, both key for managing IBS.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice relaxation techniques.&lt;/strong&gt; “To calm the gut, we must first calm the whole system by incorporating habits that help to shift the body into parasympathetic ‘rest and digest’ mode,” says Hochreiter. “Breathwork, meditation, gentle movement like yoga or tai chi, and vagus nerve stimulation (like humming or gargling) are all simple yet powerful tools to help support that process.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re dealing with IBS, what you eat matters. But how you eat might matter even more. Simple changes like slowing down, chewing your food thoroughly and eating in a relaxing environment can go a long way in improving brain-gut communication, reducing stress, supporting better digestion and calming your symptoms. Combine this simple habit with personalized recommendations from your physician or registered dietitian so you can start feeling like yourself again soon.&lt;br&gt;

But you don't have to feel this way, says registered dietitian and TODAY nutrition editor Natalie Rizzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most people are focused on getting enough protein before and after working out because they've likely heard it's crucial for muscle recovery, but it turns out that another macronutrient is just as vital, advises Rizzo, who specializes in sports nutrition. The macronutrient in question is carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But if you're thinking that her advice means you need to load up on bread, pasta or rice after every workout to get the muscle-boosting, think again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian tip of the day: Eat carbs and protein together to boost muscle recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These days it feels like the wellness world is all about protein, but carbs are just as important for staying energized and fit. That's why Rizzo recommends eating carbs and protein together after working out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Carbohydrates are the main energy source for exercise," Rizzo explains. "The body actually stores carbs in the muscles and liver to serve as the primary energy source for activity. This stored form of carbs is called glycogen, and replacing glycogen after a workout is a crucial part of recovery. If you don’t replace glycogen, you may feel fatigued later in the day and during you next workout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6019055/#sec12" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that activities like walking, jogging, swimming, bicycling or resistance training utilize glycogen and require carbohydrate replacement, either through post-exercise recovery meal or increasing carbs throughout the day,” Rizzo adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although carbohydrates have been demonized by wellness movements of the past, they have a lot of benefits,&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705" target="_blank"&gt; according to Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. They are a primary energy source for the body and often provide fiber, important for gut health and preventing chronic disease.

But you don't have to feel this way, says registered dietitian and TODAY nutrition editor Natalie Rizzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most people are focused on getting enough protein before and after working out because they've likely heard it's crucial for muscle recovery, but it turns out that another macronutrient is just as vital, advises Rizzo, who specializes in sports nutrition. The macronutrient in question is carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But if you're thinking that her advice means you need to load up on bread, pasta or rice after every workout to get the muscle-boosting, think again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian tip of the day: Eat carbs and protein together to boost muscle recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These days it feels like the wellness world is all about protein, but carbs are just as important for staying energized and fit. That's why Rizzo recommends eating carbs and protein together after working out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Carbohydrates are the main energy source for exercise," Rizzo explains. "The body actually stores carbs in the muscles and liver to serve as the primary energy source for activity. This stored form of carbs is called glycogen, and replacing glycogen after a workout is a crucial part of recovery. If you don’t replace glycogen, you may feel fatigued later in the day and during you next workout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6019055/#sec12" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that activities like walking, jogging, swimming, bicycling or resistance training utilize glycogen and require carbohydrate replacement, either through post-exercise recovery meal or increasing carbs throughout the day,” Rizzo adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although carbohydrates have been demonized by wellness movements of the past, they have a lot of benefits,&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705" target="_blank"&gt; according to Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. They are a primary energy source for the body and often provide fiber, important for gut health and preventing chronic disease. And certain whole grains, fruits and veggies can reduce risk of weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Without carbs, your muscles may not recover adequately after working out, the risks of include injury and decreased performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Incorporating carbs after a workout doesn’t need to be complicated, Rizzo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Rather than having a protein shake after a workout, make a smoothie with a protein source, like yogurt or soy milk, and add a handful of fruit.

&lt;p&gt;Good morning! Today, we discuss how scientists are pushing back against NIH funding cuts, get to know Covid contrarian Tracy Beth Høeg, who is new at the FDA, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-need-to-know-this-morning"&gt;The need-to-know this morning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regeneron Pharma&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;a href="https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/regeneron-enters-asset-purchase-agreement-acquire-23andmer-256" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;23andMe&lt;/strong&gt;, the bankrupt genetic testing and database company, for $256 million. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-some-nih-grants-are-reinstated-as-researchers-fight-back"&gt;Some NIH grants are reinstated as researchers fight back&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After an alarming wave of NIH grant terminations citing vague “agency priorities” — often targeting diversity-related studies — some scientists are mounting successful campaigns to get their research dollars back. Neurologist Charles DeCarli had his $53 million Alzheimer’s study cut in March, only to see it restored a month later after rallying lawmakers, media, and advocacy groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others are turning to lawsuits, congressional allies, and professional societies to contest defunding decisions, STAT’s Elizabeth Cooney writes. A grassroots playbook seems to be emerging — with off-the-record webinars, political pressure, and litigation — as researchers scramble to preserve scientific integrity in an increasingly politicized funding landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re reinstated and everything’s back in order,” DeCarli, who works at University of California, Davis, told STAT. “Some of the smaller universities may not want to fight this and they may just want to roll over.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-covid-contrarian-nbsp-hoeg-joins-fda-leadership"&gt;Covid contrarian Høeg joins FDA leadership&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tracy Beth Høeg, once a sports medicine physician and now a prominent skeptic of Covid-19 policies, has quietly assumed influential roles at the FDA under Commissioner Marty Makary and CBER chief Vinay Prasad. As a political appointee advising on vaccines, she’s already participated in high-level decisions — including the delay in Novavax’s Covid shot approval — raising alarms among public health experts wary of political interference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though Høeg is not explicitly anti-vaccine, she has publicly questioned mandates, vaccine schedules, and the regulatory rigor of U.S. health agencies. Her ascent may be the latest sign of a more skeptical approach to vaccines from U.S. regulators, STAT’s Lizzy Lawrence writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Americans (from the US) compared with Danes are to a much greater extent under the perception that health is something you get in a bottle, an injection, a pill, through a surgery or at the hospital,” Høeg wrote in a 2023 Substack post titled “FDA’s shortcomings: A list.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fda-green-lights-first-alzheimer-s-blood-test"&gt;FDA green lights first Alzheimer’s blood test&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FDA on Friday cleared the first blood test to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease by detecting amyloid plaques in the brain. Developed by Fujirebio Diagnostics, the test offers a faster, less invasive alternative to PET scans or spinal taps and could help catch cases earlier, potentially boosting access to next-gen drugs like Biogen and Eisai’s Leqembi and Eli Lilly’s Kisunla.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The test measures the proteins pTau217 and beta-amyloid 1-42, STAT’s Elaine Chen and Adam Feuerstein write. This approval marks a long-awaited milestone, but experts caution that the test’s ease of use might lead to overprescribing in primary care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The notion 10 years ago that there’d be a blood test that detects the pathologies of Alzheimer’s was a bit of a science fiction fantasy kind of story, and now here it is FDA-approved and ready for clinical practice,” University of Pennsylvania Alzheimer’s researcher Jason Karlawish told STAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-novavax-s-covid-19-vaccine-finally-cleared-by-fda"&gt;Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine finally cleared by FDA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From STAT’s Helen Branswell: &lt;/i&gt;Novavax has finally &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/17/fda-approves-novavax-covid-shot-with-conditions-after-delay/"&gt;received a full license&lt;/a&gt; for its Covid-19 vaccine, though the FDA put restrictions on its use that its competitors do not face. Where Moderna and Pfizer have licenses that allow use of their Covid vaccines in anyone 12 years of age and older, the FDA has limited use of the Novavax vaccine to people 65 and older, and to people aged 12 to 64 who have a medical condition that puts them at high risk of severe illness if they contract Covid. The agency did not indicate why it was applying a different criterion to the Novavax vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple signals have emerged suggesting that leadership at HHS and FDA envisage more restricted access to Covid vaccines going forward. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/15/covid-vaccine-recommendations-rfk-jr-reportedly-reversing-for-children-pregnant-women/"&gt;has reportedly told supporters&lt;/a&gt; he plans to drop recommendations for children, teens, and pregnant people to get the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other vaccine news, it emerged late last week that Kennedy has signed off on three vaccine recommendations passed last month by the CDC’s vaccines advisory panel relating to use of chikungunya vaccines. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/16/cdc-acip-advisory-panel-recommends-expanded-rsv-and-two-new-vaccines/"&gt;Three other recommendations&lt;/a&gt; passed by the ACIP in April appear to remain in limbo. They relate to use of a new meningococcal vaccine and lowering the age for who is recommended to get adult RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diverging-perspectives-on-animal-models-in-medical-research"&gt;Diverging perspectives on animal models in medical research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FDA last month announced it would phase out animal testing, replacing it with more “human-relevant” methods — including organoids and AI-based computational models. Opining for STAT are experts with opposing viewpoints:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Animal models are’t just helpful; they’re irreplaceable,” &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/19/animal-models-research-nih-biology-medical-breakthroughs-nobel-prize/" rel=""&gt;writes Carole LaBonne&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Society for Developmental Biology. “They remain central to understanding the complexities of biology and disease, paving the way for discoveries that continually improve — and save — human lives.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum are veterinarian Ellen P. Carlin, a vice president at Pathway Policy Group, and virologist Jason Paragas, who is CEO of DVLP Medicines. They assert that testing on in vivo models “was never based on a scientific rationale that animals would provide predictive models for drug interactions with human physiology.” In addition to being ethically complex, “the process has eliminated candidates that could have been game-changers for patients. The screening mechanism is faulty.”&lt;/p&gt;

Some people can do this very well, whereas others lack this capacity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg told Fox News Digital that his team's long-term goal is to "figure out what microbes are responsible for this metabolic activity so that we can create probiotics that people can consume that will afford them the capacity to generate urolithins in their gut."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reap the health benefits, Rosenberg suggested eating about five to 10 walnuts per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A person should eat five to 10 walnuts per day to reap the health benefits.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Feldman, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of nutrition at Long Island University in New York, was not affiliated with the study but told Fox News Digital that walnuts "are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These acids "are anti-inflammatory and, generally, Americans are not getting enough of them," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Lifestyle articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:foxnews.com/lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feldman also noted that walnuts are rich in fiber, which is "another nutrient Americans are lacking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adequate fiber intake is associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although walnuts are a healthy snack, Feldman said they are considered a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-calorie food;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-calorie food&lt;/a&gt; — so consumers should be mindful of portion sizes, "typically sticking to about a handful at a time throughout the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/simple-dietary-change-could-lower-your-risk-colon-cancer-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Simple dietary change could lower your risk of colon cancer, study says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Simple dietary change could lower your risk of colon cancer, study says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 13:47:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE8wc0FDREhfZ0UtVlNpejVud0JqeEozSEwzU082OHd4UkxtMkxoM2Y4Q0VJT3NKcEdLQWwyMDlRTmVVcTB5OFlYanhKSmRDRjRNci1qZkt0QnlranpBN2V3b1pMZGJLcUNNVy1paURyNHpOaU1DdkVv</guid></item><item><title>阅读小说增强同理心，消除孤独感-神经科学新闻 | Reading Fiction Boosts Empathy and Fights Loneliness - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5JODVDcVhuMEFHbXFXRzY1akxrMnlQYUxPNU9TMzFFZy1HM0Z0S0tXLVR5T25YanBmUEpEZjd5eXFOUmIwSl9zOUp5RUY2UmFmSW9sUWNxSmVHUUZvMTZQM0FiVUh0V3hMb3J2ckYwSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;While AI companions are marketed as a fix for loneliness, research shows that reading offers far more meaningful benefits. Reading fiction can foster social connection, reduce stress, enhance empathy, and even reshape brain activity linked to social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared reading and book clubs have been shown to reduce loneliness and improve mental health, especially among young adults and older populations. Unlike digital interactions, reading activates brain regions involved in understanding others, offering a powerful, low-tech solution to modern social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Brain Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Reading fiction activates brain areas tied to empathy and connection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Aid:&lt;/strong&gt; Readers report less loneliness, better sleep, and lower stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Frequent reading is linked to a lower risk of dementia and cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness has become such a widespread problem that Silicon Valley billionaires are now highlighting it to market AI companions, with Mark Zuckerberg recently stating, “the average American has fewer than three friends”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This actually echoes what the World Health Organization has called a crisis of social isolation and loneliness. They report that around 25% of older adults are socially isolated and 5%-15% of adolescents are lonely. But a variety of research – including our own – suggests reading may be a much better solution than chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110118"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a person reading and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A number of studies have similarly shown that engaging in cognitively stimulating activities, such as reading, can slow cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human interaction is no doubt hugely important. In a study we published in 2023, we found that it only takes around five close friends &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;for children and adolescents to thrive&lt;/a&gt;, giving them better brain structure, cognition, academic performance and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having fewer than five close friends may not provide enough social contact. But larger numbers are less likely to be close friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dilemma of technology frequently means that despite some people having vast numbers of friends on social media, they are not close friends and so do not provide the social support needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, chatbots may not provide the type of face-to-face social interaction that people need to flourish. During the pandemic lockdowns, a study found that face-to-face communication was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10191089/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;far more beneficial&lt;/a&gt; for mental health than digital communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can reading help us to feel less lonely and have better wellbeing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent survey from The Queen’s Reading Room, the charity and book club of Queen Camilla, and other surveys, have found that reading fiction and other books significantly reduces feelings of loneliness and improves wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another charity, The Reader, conducted a survey of approximately 2,000 participants and found that this was especially true among young adults. Fifty-nine percent of those aged 18-34 said reading made them feel more connected to others and 56% felt less alone during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another survey, in conjunction with the University of Liverpool, of over 4,000 participants found that reading offers powerful benefits, serving as a top method for reducing stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, participants reported that reading encouraged personal growth, such as improving health, picking up hobbies and boosting empathy, with 64% of readers having a better understanding others’ feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reading and the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, scientific research looking at book clubs and shared reading back this up, finding &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38316632/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;notable emotional and social benefits&lt;/a&gt; of reading. For example, students reported greater connection (42.9%) to others, deeper understanding of others’ experiences and beliefs (61.2%) and reduced loneliness (14.3%) as a result of reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surveys above all rely on people reporting how they feel, rather than an objective measure. But there are also findings from objective measures of the brain, including neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of 11 intervention studies showed that shared reading among older adults &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/40/2/daaf036/8110077?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;improved wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; and helped alleviate loneliness and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way in which reading may help reduce loneliness is by enhancing our social cognition, which is the ability to understand and connect with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/2/215/2375122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neuroimaging study&lt;/a&gt; of young adults found that reading fiction, particularly passages with social content, activated areas of the brain involved in social behaviour and emotional understanding, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brain region was also linked to the stronger social cognition seen in frequent fiction readers, suggesting a neural pathway through which reading fosters greater social connectedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, reading may also reduce the risk of dementia. One study of 469 people aged 75 and over, with no dementia at baseline, were followed up for 5.1 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among leisure activities such as playing board games, playing musical instruments and dancing, reading was associated &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12815136/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with a 35% reduced risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of studies have similarly shown that engaging in cognitively stimulating activities, such as reading, &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/abs/10.1212/01.wnl.0000192165.99963.2a?casa_token=Ihv-keCL5qcAAAAA%3AuPNBvFyPFqvcxqrGrC3dwdbh-qZGPWIEGh6yxq9WVMekTDULJx-_N3u4WxYMOlvUCKT7VSwP5oFTndLL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;can slow cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11851541/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reduce the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our own research also showed the benefits of reading for pleasure early in life. In a large sample of over 10,000 children in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/earlyinitiated-childhood-reading-for-pleasure-associations-with-better-cognitive-performance-mental-wellbeing-and-brain-structure-in-young-adolescence/03FB342223A3896DB8C39F171659AE33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;we found that&lt;/a&gt; those children who read for pleasure early in life had better brain structure, cognition, academic achievement, longer sleep duration and better mental health – including lower symptoms of inattention, stress and depression – when adolescents.

However, little is mentioned about the kingdom &lt;em&gt;Fungi.&lt;/em&gt; Hundreds of thousands of species of fungi have been described, but that’s &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/67065410" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:likely only 10 percent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;likely only 10 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the total number of fungal species that exist on Earth. These species include everyone’s delicious favorites, but also some more dangerous species that can cause toxic infections in animals and agricultural crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, in a new study from the University of Manchester, scientists asked the question of what &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a22584056/rising-temperatures-could-lead-increased-suicide-rates/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rising global temperatures;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rising global temperatures&lt;/a&gt; could mean for the proliferation of some of these meaner mycelia.

The study showed that within 15 years, if the world still relies on mostly &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/green-tech/a32036783/gas-pump-warning/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fossil fuels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt; instead of clean energy, fungi like &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/em&gt;—a cause of agricultural rot that also produces mycotoxins that are harmful to mammals—will spread by 16 percent, which would put an additional 1 million people at risk of infection in Europe alone. This is largely because &lt;em&gt;A. flavus &lt;/em&gt;is more thermotolerant than other fungi, meaning that it can thrive in hot, humid climates where other fungi simply could not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, this proliferation is relatively tame compared to &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/em&gt;, which would increase its range by 77.5 percent and put an additional &lt;em&gt;nine million people&lt;/em&gt; in Europe at risk under this &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a248/1289281/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:worst-case scenario;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;worst-case scenario&lt;/a&gt;.

Some life-&lt;em&gt;sustaining&lt;/em&gt; fungi, responsible for breaking down plant and animal matter, may not be able to survive in some of the hottest parts of the world (especially on the African continent). It’s basically a one-two punch of bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, the study only examined the roughly 10 percent of the fungi we know about, so even more infections or health concerns could arise from surprising sources currently unknown to us.

He adds that your body’s hormonal processes can also cause hair loss. This is because it’s a process that happens in the scalp when the skin converts testosterone to active testosterone. Factors such as anabolic steroid use can raise testosterone levels and worsen this process. Other hormone imbalances, such as those caused by thyroid dysfunction or chronic stress, can contribute to different types of hair loss as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you’re worried about hair loss, there are blood tests you can take to see if it’s genetic or hormonal. “It could be due to a disease that can be managed. And, if not, it will help you gain an understanding of what you can expect over the next five, 10, 15 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Environmental factors can also speed up or slow down the process, says Sokratous. “Are you eating a diet rich in nutrients like zinc, vitamin D, iron and B vitamins? Is your body absorbing them properly? Adjusting your diet can slow things down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 13:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOVGEweUlwYmFrZFhOamk2VWFmN2JpLUpXVkcwX3I5MGxkVDNCQ19qeFpuSWZVME9MXzZIcUd2a19IZjRaYVpjRTk5eHdNazJfb0praGVlRXhTUWlvZTZYeEVLX3RXQjRPbzVXNlVQUkNYUzZuMUtFX0E2WUlQNmRhbTJRS21nV2s0VE1ESDB6Nl9XM0F5T0JTMjIySEdZTGxVX0lVdWNCNFkwdUp0eUgtSkZidVc4NV9PczJV</guid></item><item><title>尊敬的医生：德国麻疹与普通麻疹相同吗？ - OregonLive.com | Dear Doctor: Is German measles the same as regular measles? - OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JPB2L2NB6NFONF7OYJ5UBNQNGI"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I read a recent column of yours in which you said that everyone who is my age can assume we’ve had measles. I remember having measles when I was in the second grade but have a vague memory of my parents calling it German measles, which I believe is rubella. If a person has had either, do they have immunity to both types of measles? -- S.F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WRU27VH4DBCU7FBNVU64ZWRKZA"&gt;ANSWER: If you were born before 1957, you are likely (but not 100% sure) to be immune to measles (sometimes called red measles) and mumps. However, rubella (German measles) is a different disease, and immunity to one does not ensure immunity to the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K3IXO2LDD5HVFMVZHSAXWOYQAY"&gt;The biggest health concern with rubella is when a woman of childbearing age contracts it as the potential damage to her developing fetus can be severe. So, every woman who could get pregnant is tested for immunity at the earliest opportunity. All health care workers should have documented immunity to measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LYADFCCA7JFUNFE3Y372CICF2I"&gt;The United States is in the middle of a large measles outbreak now, and those living in an area with transmission should be sure that they are immune to measles. This can be done by checking blood antibody levels or giving an extra dose to those who have already been immunized (or two doses to those who have never been immunized). At the time that I write this, there is no rubella outbreak in the U.S., but if there is, the advice will be similar to demonstrate immunity to rubella as it is for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: Would you say a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in my water every morning would give me a more alkaline system? -- L.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DDXUQ6EMKRG5LDTZ3ZB2PMQGV4"&gt;ANSWER: Baking soda is basic or alkali on the pH scale. If you put a 1/2 teaspoon in a large glass of water, the pH of the resulting solution will be around 8.3 or so. However, as soon as you drink it, the acid in your stomach will overwhelm the baking soda since stomach acid is a lot stronger an acid than baking soda is a base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XMEKBDEB4BHNHLQQLVXU44FZTI"&gt;Furthermore, your body has robust systems to keep your body’s pH regulated at just around 7.4. Your kidneys and lungs will quickly act to maintain your body’s pH, whether you take in a lot of alkaline like baking soda or a whole lot of acid like lemon juice or lemonade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="22H45Q6XTNA6XHYZCWI4VEXTT4"&gt;These pH regulatory systems have evolved to keep the blood pH at a slightly alkaline level, and even small changes from this level usually represent serious illness. You don’t want to change your blood pH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SVYDVSSVDZB5FCCBGIMTDAIOBI"&gt;DR. ROACH WRITES: A recent column on Raynaud’s phenomenon generated several comments from readers. One person was disappointed I didn’t mention that Raynaud’s can affect the feet, but they are right that it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F4CI6SYRN5CNLANV4AALC7IHGA"&gt;Another person noted relief by taking fish oil twice daily. The medical literature suggests that this can be of benefit for those with primary Raynaud’s -- meaning not in combination with a rheumatologic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y42VK5B4YZE43BRPXLSPZY2UKM"&gt;Another suggestion was magnesium, which helped another reader out. Since fish oil and magnesium are low-risk interventions, I wanted to pass these on with thanks to the readers who wrote in with their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MNAKOSIVHNDI5LKBBCESDMWDBM"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.
