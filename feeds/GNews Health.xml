However, as Nickel noted: “These tests carry the potential for healthy people to receive unnecessary diagnoses, which could lead to unnecessary medical treatments or impact mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said she was struck by the “really personal narratives” being used: “Fearmongering that if you don’t do this test, you’re not taking care of your own health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;For example, despite the science of the gut microbiome test being in its very early stages, an Instagram account with over 65,000 followers promoted the test to its followers, telling them: “You DESERVE to be healthy. It is your BIRTHRIGHT. These tests will let us know with CERTAINTY what is causing your specific health concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Researchers involved in the study found the overwhelming majority of posts (87.1%) mentioned benefits of the tests, with harms mentioned by less than 15% of posts, and only 6% mentioned overdiagnosis or overuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A promotional tone was used in 83.8% of posts – more than half (50.7%) encouraged viewers to take action and get the test, and 68% of account holders had financial interests involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Posts from doctors were more likely to mention harms and less likely to have an overall promotional tone but Nickel said in some cases they were also “really strongly promoting the test”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One medical doctor with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;more than 65,000 followers on TikTok promoted the multi-cancer early detection test to their followers, telling them: “As you get older the chance of cancer is pretty high, if you do this test yearly then you’ll pretty much catch cancer early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;We should all think again when an influencer encourages us to get tested&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/01/expert-says-overdiagnosis-means-australian-cancer-screening-tests-must-be-handled-very-carefully" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;harms of cancer overdiagnosis&lt;/a&gt; were most clear, Nickel said, with both the full-body MRI and multi-cancer early detection test promoted as a way to identify early forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Overdiagnosis refers to the diagnosis of very early forms of disease that are unlikely to cause any symptoms or problems but knowledge of which can do more harm than good, leading to psychological stress and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/09/overdiagnosis-some-breast-cancer-treatments-may-have-been-unnecessary-study-suggests" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unnecessary treatments including major surgery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In addition to concerns about overdiagnosis, there were the financial costs of the tests themselves (full-body MRIs cost upwards of $800 in Australia) and of costly interventions pursued as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Despite egg-timer tests being &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dont-believe-the-hype-egg-timer-tests-cant-reliably-predict-your-chance-of-conceiving-or-menopause-timing-207008" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unable to reliably predict a woman’s chance of conceiving&lt;/a&gt;, Nickel said there were concerns women who received low results may experience unnecessary anxiety, and go down the path of elective egg freezing or IVF interventions when they may not have been needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said the test “preys on the insecurity” of women regarding their future capacity to conceive, noting it was often promoted to younger women who might be years away from the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A medical doctor with more than 70,000 TikTok followers promoted the test: “Whether you’re in your teens or 30s, empowering yourself with fertility knowledge is extremely important. For women, age is not a friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The testosterone test was most closely linked to promotion of treatments or supplements, and often carried “really clear narratives around masculinity”, Nickel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A TikTok account with close to 100,000 followers promoted the testosterone test by telling followers: “Watch out for this scary sign of low testosterone levels … You should be waking up in the morning with a boner. If you’re not waking up in the morning with a boner there’s a large possibility you have a low testosterone level. Get it checked!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said there were also potential dangers for men taking some testosterone supplements because of a lack of long-term evidence around safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She said the problem overall was that because these tests were often sold direct to consumers, they “take the middle man – the doctor – out of the equation” and the space for a person to discuss with a medical professional whether they need the test or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Stacy Carter, the director of the Australian Centre for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Engagement, Evidence and Values at the University of Wollongong, said the study used robust methods and “shows clearly that influential social media posts promote testing and talk up the alleged benefits of testing – even when tests are useless, or potentially harmful”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This study adds to the evidence that medical misinformation is common on social media, and suggests we should all think again when an influencer encourages us to get tested,” Carter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nickel said stronger regulation was needed so that the onus was not on individuals to see through the misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 19:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOTjMwZmRpYmZLS3ZLd19fWEFVQWdEM1l4d1NqVjhBcGZnTmQzUDZWdTBYSWFRTUVYT0duWlVGZGNrUndJMGJrOGRIY3ZBY3QzOGZFMF9xRGdZQ3pnVEE1ZU9lZl9PeDZlZ3prR1cxY1V0MjZ3X0o4RGdOdlhCbHQ1b0lRQmxiVmtxdGxHRWtYdHAyZVlQcmY1TWJNUkhrYVM2ZGJwU29ROXQ3dnZVLWduUWNyZ2pLalZKcHRJT1dNNnpuYWZkS1dzTDVSUjgtbXI2RGZXUHc5eVZRVmhCNmc1cHZB</guid></item><item><title>Measles death of unvaccinated child in Texas outbreak is 1st fatality in US in a decade - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxNM2Q2MXF6RXQ3alczdFpMTXhFWnMxdVBYWFUtSk5GUGQxeVhiV1VwbW16UW14anNWRm95R1p3MGZDdm5kV0dqVGRuMkRhdzZaQjE1eXZmbDI2R0RUaDlFRUc0M0NvRUlFY3Bpb2s0aUhfWlpDZldWSGQyVmNNX0FSSXZEb2lPLWQ3U0tOQXItX0d2bDBvQ1RNckxjbG43aHhrU084SWg1NNIBrAFBVV95cUxNM0d4bVBDZllfRXk4NE43a3BGaV9mV0NQNzhvQVg5VndsRUU1bE9DbUJpTVpXSy0zMW9YYVNYUURmM2lBU0VtR1hGU05LXzNXa2FGelJhVDdRcmpwQWp6VHRXR1NIZlp2NnIzTVJGV0NiTFJEbjFKZkJ3Z3E4aW53TW03Ql9scC1pcFRaRHJkWjNDUm45M1NuRHUzdThpczE2VTlJYVNneTlRaWZi?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;An unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas has died of measles, the first associated with an &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-124-cases-unvaccinated/story?id=119158746" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak in the western part of the state&lt;/a&gt;

"Every new case is a reminder of why vaccination is critical. Tragically, with an outbreak of this scale, a fatal case was not unexpected, especially among those unvaccinated.

&lt;p&gt;Watching your hair gray and your skin crease has long been considered an inevitable part of life, but a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074293" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; has revealed promising avenues for combating visible signs of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/19/health/controversial-supplements-can-get-rid-of-zombie-cells-that-speed-up-aging/"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some antiaging skin care does employ hormones — mainly &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-retinol-cream-serum/"&gt;retinol&lt;/a&gt; and tretinoin in topical retinoids, as well as estrogen, which treats symptoms related to menopause. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers in Germany have identified a much wider variety of hormones that may have the potential to turn back time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;German researchers have identified a wide variety of hormones that could have antiaging effects. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;wayhome.studio  – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our paper highlights key hormone players that orchestrate pathways of skin aging such as degradation of connective tissue (leading to wrinkling), stem cell survival and loss of pigment (leading to hair graying),” said lead study author &lt;a href="https://www.growkudos.com/profile/Markus_B%C3%B6hm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Markus Böhm&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatology professor at the University of Münster.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of the hormones we studied have antiaging properties and may be used in the future as agents to prevent skin aging.”   &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The researchers wanted to better understand how hormones affect skin aging, so they focused on insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/health/you-may-be-able-to-delay-menopause-with-your-sex-life/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt;, retinoids and melatonin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melatonin stood out as a promising antiaging treatment because it is a small, affordable and well-tolerated molecule that also acts as an &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/health/a-handful-of-this-snack-can-boost-mood-and-reduce-cancer-risk/"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; and helps regulate energy production in cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most widely known as a hormone that helps regulate sleep-wake cycles, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/04/health/dont-take-melatonin-supplements-for-insomnia-sleep-doctors/"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; can be found naturally in milk, which contains an amino acid called tryptophan that the body converts into melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Melatonin, primarily known for helping you sleep, can be found naturally in tart cherries. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fortyforks – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melatonin can also be found in high amounts in nuts (especially almonds, pistachios and walnuts), some fish (tuna and salmon) and tart cherries — the key ingredient in the TikTok-famous &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/02/health/i-tried-the-sleepy-girl-mocktail-insomnia-cure-the-viral-fad-works-but-theres-one-problem/"&gt;Sleepy Girl Mocktail&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the identified hormones had surprising effects on skin and hair aging, especially in people with certain genetic conditions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Post Care"&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at other hormones, such as α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (which controls skin color), hormones from the thyroid system, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/health/this-nasal-spray-might-be-the-cure-to-loneliness/"&gt;oxytocin&lt;/a&gt; and endocannabinoids (found in CBD products). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you get older, your skin experiences intrinsic aging — a natural process that follows the passage of time — and extrinsic aging — aging due to external factors, such as sun exposure, air pollution, smoking, poor diet, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/health/just-1-sleepless-night-is-as-bad-for-your-immune-system-as-obesity-study/"&gt;lack of sleep&lt;/a&gt; and stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Some of the hormones we studied have antiaging properties and may be used in the future as agents to prevent skin aging,” lead study author Markus Böhm said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;triocean – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that these hormones could help protect skin from sun damage, slow signs of aging and influence hair pigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were published Tuesday in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/edrv/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1210/endrev/bnae034/8029650" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;journal Endocrine Reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Skin is not only a target for various hormones that control pathways of skin aging, but itself is certainly the largest and richest site for hormone production besides classical endocrine glands,” Böhm said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Further research into these hormones may offer opportunities to develop new therapeutics for treating and preventing skin aging.” &lt;/p&gt;

In short, it's even more evidence demonstrating the importance of COVID vaccines, not just for adults, but for kids as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an extremely important topic now that the Trump administration is &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administrations-attacks-on-science-in-first-30-days/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;systematically trying to defund scientific research&lt;/a&gt; — a &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/business/trumps-whiplash-policies-keep-pharmas-on-their-toes" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;bizarre change of tune&lt;/a&gt;, considering Trump was behind a concerted effort called Operation Warp Speed in the early days of the pandemic to speed up the development of COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As detailed in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830556" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;one of the two studies&lt;/a&gt;, published this week in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, a team of US-based pediatricians and CDC researchers found that COVID-19 vaccinations were associated with a 57 percent drop in the odds of developing one or more post-COVID condition symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the mRNA-based vaccines that have become commonplace since the global pandemic are highly effective at warding off long COVID in children aged five to 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that effectiveness is as relevant as it was during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that children should stay up to date with current COVID-19 vaccination recommendations as vaccination not only protects against severe COVID-19 illness but also protects against [long COVID]," the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830557" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;separate cohort study&lt;/a&gt;, also published this week in the same journal, found that "concerns that young athletes with COVID-19 would be at increased risk of myocarditis and sudden cardiac arrest" were unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers compared instances of cardiac deaths that occurred before and during the pandemic, and found "no increase" in either of these conditions after it struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/04/11/cdc-finds-no-link-between-covid-vaccines-and-cardiac-death-in-young-people/?sh=650e6ec1577f" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;builds on existing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that there's no link between the disease and cardiac death in young people. In early 2023, the media was awash with reports of young athletes reportedly suffering cardiac arrest as a result of a COVID infection, lingering rumors that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/01/damar-hamlin-cardiac-arrest-covid-anti-vaccine-heart-theories/672644/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;persisted&lt;/a&gt; despite &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-covid-vaccines-athlete-deaths-1500-989195878254" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;sustained efforts to debunk them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an especially pertinent topic now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken over as Trump's health secretary. Kennedy has previously questioned the scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don't cause autism and has denied that COVID vaccines have saved millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/18/rfk-jr-covid-19-vaccinations" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported last month&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy's non-profit, the Children's Health Defense, reportedly tried to block new COVID vaccinations from being rolled out during the height of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where his staunchly anti-vaccine stance will leave the future role of vaccinations in the United States remains unclear at best. His appointment has already proven highly controversial.

The new body is set to take aim at the alleged overprescription of drugs for the treatment of ADHD and the prevalence of autism and asthma in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have also warned that Kennedy's vaccine cynicism could &lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-polio-eradication-public-health-vaccine" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;greatly undermine US efforts to eradicate polio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an unfortunate prognosis for the future of public health.

              &lt;p&gt;Something is killing people in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and no one knows what it is. World Health Organization officials have reported two clusters of a mystery illness in the area that has sickened hundreds and killed dozens in the past few weeks alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WHO officials in the African Region released the &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380529/OEW7-1016022025.pdf"&gt;latest update&lt;/a&gt; on the situation last Thursday. So far, there have been 431 cases and 53 deaths attributed to an unknown illness in northwestern DRC dating back to January. Initial tests have ruled out established suspects like Ebola and Marburg, and it’s still unclear whether there’s a single culprit to blame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DRC officials reported the newest cases in mid-February. The largest and latest outbreak is occurring in Bomate Village, with at least 419 people sickened and 45 dead as of February 15. Several weeks earlier, a cluster of illness was also reported in Boloko Village. At least 12 cases and eight deaths were documented in Boloko and the nearby village of Danda.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the two outbreaks are in the same region (the Équateur Province), it’s not certain yet whether they are truly connected. People in both outbreaks have experienced similar symptoms, which include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal pain, and headache. Some people have also experienced hemorrhaging (potentially life-threatening blood loss), but tests for Ebola and Marburg virus—well-known causes of hemorrhagic fever—have come up negative in both outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever the cause, it’s rapidly striking victims down. In nearly half of the deaths, people have succumbed to their illness within 48 hours, and the overall mortality rate is currently around 10%. The limited medical resources and general isolation of these villages is also hampering efforts to treat cases and identify the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The situation in Équateur Province presents significant public health risk, with two clusters of an unknown disease causing high morbidity and mortality,” WHO officials wrote in their report. “The remote geography and limited healthcare infrastructure exacerbate response challenges, with overwhelmed health facilities struggling to manage cases.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unknown clusters of illness occasionally happen in the world, and usually, they’re eventually identified as something established. Last December, for instance, an &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-mysterious-illness-is-killing-people-in-southwestern-congo-2000534031"&gt;outbreak of a mystery deadly illness&lt;/a&gt; in a different part of the DRC was ultimately attributed to a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congos-health-ministry-says-unknown-disease-is-severe-malaria-2024-12-17/"&gt;severe form of malaria&lt;/a&gt; (likely aided by high rates of malnutrition in the area). Rarely, however, these clusters do lead to the discovery of a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-mysterious-virus-is-sickening-people-in-china-1840857359"&gt;new disease-causing germ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, WHO officials say that the most likely possibilities for these latest outbreaks are malaria, food or water poisoning, typhoid fever, meningitis, or some other type of viral hemorrhagic fever. Perhaps significantly, the first cases in the earlier cluster were found in young children who had recently eaten a bat carcass just before becoming sick. Bats are known to carry many viruses and bacteria that can sicken humans, and they’re considered &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddiscovery201648"&gt;a major risk&lt;/a&gt; for the spread of novel diseases that could spill over into humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WHO officials and extra medical supplies have been sent to the region to aid local doctors, and further genetic testing of patients’ samples is now underway.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

The M.R.I. could pick up on traces of cancer or other diseases, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the post was too simple, the University of Sydney public health researcher Brooke Nickel thought when she saw it in August 2023. What about the possible harms, she wondered? The test might find an extremely early stage cancer that would lead to a patient receiving invasive treatment, even though it may never have progressed to something more serious. Ms. Kardashian’s post made it seem like there were only upsides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That post, and others like it, prompted Dr. Nickel to look into how other celebrities and influencers promote increasingly popular medical tests such as &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/well/live/mri-prenuvo-full-body-scan.html" title=""&gt;full-body M.R.I. scans&lt;/a&gt;. They also examined posts for products that claim to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/health/cancer-blood-tests.html" title=""&gt;detect cancer in blood&lt;/a&gt; or analyze &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/health/fertility-test-ovarian-reserve.html" title=""&gt;a hormone&lt;/a&gt; linked to fertility, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/well/live/men-tesosterone-tests-ads.html" title=""&gt;testosterone levels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/22/well/eat/gut-microbiome-health.html" title=""&gt;the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The results of that study, which scrutinized nearly 1,000 TikTok and Instagram posts from accounts with hundreds of millions of combined followers, were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday.&lt;/a&gt; The paper found that an overwhelming majority of these posts were misleading, painting an overly rosy picture of these tests and rarely including scientific evidence. Only 15 percent mentioned potential harms. And more than two-thirds came from accounts with financial ties to the products, like influencers offering discounts and receiving sales commissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“If this is how patients are getting all their information, it’s really unfortunate, because it’s completely acting like medical tests are a new cool pair of sneakers,” said Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, director of the Radiology Outcomes Research Laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Eighteen have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can be life-threatening to anyone who is not protected against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doctors say the best way to protect against the disease is with two doses of a vaccine, which is usually administered to children as a combination measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine prevent more than 97 percent of measles infections, according to Texas health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The South Plains region of Texas, where the outbreak has been spreading, has &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; that lag significantly behind federal targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;New Mexico has also &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;reported an outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, with nine cases in Lea County, in the southeastern part of the state, on the Texas border. Four of those cases are children under the age of 18, all of whom are unvaccinated, according to Robert Nott, a spokesman for the New Mexico Department of Health. None of the cases in New Mexico have led to hospitalizations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The outbreak comes amid growing concerns among public health experts about declining vaccination rates and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/rfk-jr-hhs-senate-confirmation.html" title=""&gt;the confirmation of Robert F.

People who are infected will begin to have symptoms within a week or two after being exposed. Early symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Within a few days, a telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then spreads down the neck and trunk to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Texas health officials have been holding vaccination clinics and encouraging people to get the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 16:20:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5YYVh6d1lHcEpNeVd0eFdBX0pWbEQzdm1hVWREYzJzclZJNWR0T2dUOHZvZ1ltbTU4YWpxc0VIWWdIaFZXMkZfZEJGd0RoYjIwT3BuQ0h2VGNLb2pIRVlEUnpISi1LcnBHZXRXQXhRbndQSkxMaENiLURoYw</guid></item><item><title>Best Supplements to Reduce Cortisol: We Asked Experts if Supplements Can Really Lower Stress - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE5tYmF0UHk0cmQ1SUNHUGZlX2tRejFQaDMwTjRjVFFaUkNtMjMtY0V5SzNGM0UzRWxUUnh3akVWb2hvd1lXZnB2VTNEUXBCRmZkSG1BTVJYLU9NMUNOWmZZN3otRW1WS3NLY1AtVGJYanh1UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;Cortisol is nothing new; we have known about it since its &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6621919/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;discovery in the mid-20th century&lt;/a&gt;. However, in the last year or so, this naturally occurring hormone has entered the limelight of social media. Indeed, you can find videos on TikTok discussing "&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/do-you-have-cortisol-face-expert/" target="_self"&gt;cortisol face&lt;/a&gt;" with millions of views. Unfortunately, trends are rarely as simple as they appear and may have people jumping into action before learning what cortisol supplements even are and how they react in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;While cortisol supplements can be the right choice in some situations, it's essential to understand the myriad factors that come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is cortisol, and how is it related to stress?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol is often called the "&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/cortisol-why-this-important-stress-hormone-is-important-for-your-health/" target="_self"&gt;stress hormone&lt;/a&gt;" and is released by the adrenal glands -- part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, a bodily system that regulates the stress response --  when our bodies experience stress. It helps our bodies respond to threatening experiences while managing several facets of our biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol regulates blood sugar, suppresses inflammation, regulates metabolism, is involved in our circadian rhythms and influences the fight-or-flight reaction. It's essential for survival. Because &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538239/#:~:text=Though%20widely%20known%20as%20the,production%20and%20secretion%20of%20cortisol." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone&lt;/a&gt;, and most of our body tissue has glucocorticoid receptors, cortisol can have a broad and ubiquitous effect throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary aspects can also influence our cortisol levels, according to &lt;a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/diogo-barardo/en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Diogo Barardo&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., director of R&amp;amp;D at biotechnology company Novos Core. For instance, higher levels of sugar and saturated fats in a diet can negatively increase cortisol levels. Conversely, a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains may lower cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond diet, though, several other factors can influence your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/stressed-tired-cortisol-imbalance-symptoms/" target="_self"&gt;cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;. These factors include some medications, alcohol, caffeine, adrenal gland tumors, athletic activity, pregnancy and a variety of health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Yurii Yarema/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High cortisol symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excessively high cortisol levels, especially when sustained over time, can be damaging. Chronic high cortisol can also negatively affect metabolic health by promoting insulin resistance and inflammatory processes," said Barardo. In some cases, high cortisol levels could be a sign of Cushing disease, also known as hypercortisolism, a progressive pituitary disease that causes the body to overproduce cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of high cortisol can vary between individuals. They include weight gain in the face and abdomen, fat buildup under the shoulder blades, purple stretchmarks across the abdomen, decreasing muscle strength, high blood sugar, hypertension, excessive hair growth in women and osteoporosis. &lt;a href="https://drbrighten.com/high-cortisol-and-cognitive-function/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Mental symptoms can include&lt;/a&gt; brain fog, memory issues and irritability. While this captures many of the possible symptoms, it may not contain all of them. In many cases, people will only experience some of these symptoms when they have high cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience symptoms of high cortisol, consider speaking with a medical expert about the risks of high cortisol and Cushing disease. On the other hand, if you have dangerously low cortisol levels, you will want to discuss Addison's disease. Thankfully, you can consult a physician and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/i-got-a-cortisol-blood-stress-test-heres-what-i-learned-and-how-it-affected-my-lifestyle/" target="_self"&gt;test your cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;. Ruling out such illnesses, however, may require several tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol tests are often performed using blood samples but can also be done through urinary analysis. Because the urinary analysis test uses a series of inputs over 24 hours, this test may yield more accurate results than blood tests, which often only capture cortisol data from one point in a person's day. As Barardo has said, "This captures cortisol fluctuations throughout the day rather than at one single point in time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best supplements to potentially reduce cortisol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are dietary factors that can increase or decrease cortisol levels, the supplements that aid in this do so indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cortisol itself isn't typically supplemented directly, but certain supplements may help regulate cortisol," Barardo said. "Certain supplements like magnesium, vitamin C, Rhodiola rosea and pterostilbene [the primary antioxidant component of blueberries] are studied for their potential to help regulate cortisol and mitigate the stress response." He said that each of these compounds has the potential to affect cortisol levels through "modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Yana Iskayeva/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C may be one of the top potential supplements to reduce cortisol and is readily abundant in several formats. However, how much of this supplement you should take will vary between products. To ensure you're safe, read the product guidelines to ensure you don't exceed the recommended amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38010274/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;study published in 2023&lt;/a&gt; found that vitamin C can reduce cortisol levels in some patients with hypercortisolemia. "Vitamin C plays a notable role in cortisol modulation, particularly under stress, through its influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis," Barardo said. "Research demonstrates that vitamin C can reduce excessive cortisol production in response to both psychological and physical stressors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C can be found naturally in several foods that are commonly available. All citrus fruits have vitamin C within them, but so do potatoes, peppers, strawberries, broccoli and Brussel sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plant is considered an adaptogenic herb, meaning it's believed to help the body manage and reduce stress responses. The US National Institute of Health states within its &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;fact sheet on ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt; (Withania somnifera) that "several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, most of them fairly small in size and of short duration, have found that ashwagandha may reduce perceived stress and anxiety and improve the quality and duration of sleep." However, because these studies used different ashwagandha preparations and doses, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific recommendation for a specific supplement to reduce cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's rare to find this plant in everyday recipes, but it can be found as a dietary supplement in several forms ranging from powders to gummies to beverages. How much you should take will vary between these products, so checking the directions before use is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Anna Blazhuk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has pursued the idea of omega-3 fatty acids having a reductive effect on cortisol levels. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8510994/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;paper published in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that participants who took high levels of omega-3 had lower levels of cortisol when compared to the placebo group. How much of this you can safely eat daily is based on your age, with a &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;recommended intake table&lt;/a&gt; on the National Institute for Health covering each age category. For men over age 14, 1.6 grams daily is recommended, while women over 14 should consume 1.1 grams daily. Those who are pregnant or lactating should consume more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are found in many foods but are especially common in fish, like salmon, mackerel and tuna, and some types of seeds, such as flaxseed, chia seeds and walnuts. Omega-3s can also be obtained as a dietary supplement in various forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rhodiola rosea&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As an adaptogen, Rhodiola rosea supports the body's stress response by modulating the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis," Barardo said. "This axis plays a central role in cortisol production, and Rhodiola's effects help balance cortisol levels rather than simply suppress or elevate them, which is characteristic of adaptogens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19016404/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;a 2009 study&lt;/a&gt;, repeated doses of Rhodiola rosea can have "an anti-fatigue effect that increases mental performance, particularly the ability to concentrate, and decreases cortisol response to awakening stress in burnout patients with fatigue syndrome." Exact dosages for this compound will vary between products, but each supplement for lowering cortisol should include recommended intakes on its packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Boonchai Wedmakawand/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pterostilbene&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pterostilbene, an antioxidant mainly found in blueberries, has been found to improve stress-related behaviors. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33739881/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;study published in 2021&lt;/a&gt; tested pterostilbene treatments on mice, and their findings "suggest that pterostilbene may effectively modulate stress-related abnormal behaviors, neuroinflammation and HPA axis hyperactivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although direct studies on pterostilbene's effect on cortisol are still emerging, early evidence suggests it could support a balanced stress response through neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, which may make it beneficial in chronic stress scenarios," Barardo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol supplements utilizing pterostilbene may be less common but should contain specific recommended intakes for each product if available. As for food sources, aside from blueberries, pterostilbene can be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36234852/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;found in grapes and peanuts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are these supplements safe and necessary?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While supplements to lower cortisol may be generally safe for most people, they are not the only way to regulate stress. Whether or not these cortisol supplements are necessary will vary between individuals and circumstances; most individuals without cortisol-related illnesses should be okay without them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Supplements that help regulate cortisol are generally safe, but they're not always necessary for everyone," Barardo said. "A healthy lifestyle that includes &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/7-stress-relieving-tactics-that-will-help-you-reach-your-carefree-era/" target="_self"&gt;stress management practices&lt;/a&gt; can help maintain optimal cortisol levels naturally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help reduce stress levels without needing cortisol supplements, people may be interested in practicing meditation, yoga, pursuing other athletic activities or finding various means of coping with high stress. Research has underscored a variety of mechanisms for reducing stress, with a strong emphasis on what's called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513300/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;mindfulness-based stress reduction&lt;/a&gt;. Although these techniques can be very effective in some cases, not everyone is equally inclined towards mindfulness practices, and learning these techniques without a guide can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considering cortisol supplements, it's important to know that the FDA does not regulate supplements. Hence, the requirements for accuracy, transparency and testing are often less than expected. Barardo also points out, "Over-reliance on supplements marketed as cortisol regulators may not address the root causes of stress or high cortisol."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Tetra Images/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about cortisol blockers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol blockers, like mifepristone and pasireotide, are prescription medications &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24126229/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;used to treat Cushing's syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. They work by either blocking the uptake of cortisol to receptors or by preventing the release of cortisol in the first place. Beyond this particular class of medication, some people may also refer to supplements and tactics for reducing cortisol levels as blockers, but the difference can be vast. Companies marketing over-the-counter cortisol blockers often rebrand cortisol supplements or other approaches for lowering cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cortisol blocker medications, there can be side effects that your doctor will discuss with you if you're prescribed these medications. These side effects vary between specific cortisol blocker medications. However, these medications are FDA-approved for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cortisol supplements and stress-coping techniques, how safe they are will vary between supplements and techniques. Supplements should have recommended dosages but can be cross-checked against recommended intake levels for specific compounds, like magnesium or vitamin C. However, it is essential to remember that the FDA does not regulate supplements. Always consult with your healthcare provider before taking any supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to naturally reduce cortisol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to influence and reduce your cortisol levels naturally. How well these approaches work will vary between individuals and instances, with some approaches becoming more effective with practice or time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce cortisol levels, Barardo recommends regular exercise, a balanced diet and engaging in meditation and mindfulness.  "Vitamin C-rich foods and a healthy lifestyle that includes sleep and physical activity are also effective at keeping cortisol levels in check," he added. "Additionally, interacting with loved ones and &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2018/02/power-pets" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;pets can lower cortisol&lt;/a&gt; and increase serotonin, improving mental health, reducing stress and helping people live longer, healthier lives." Avoiding foods that put excess stress on the body, like caffeine or alcohol, is also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human health is often seen as holistic, wherein improving health metrics in one area will also increase health in other areas. Many of these approaches for reducing cortisol involve increasing general areas of health. Pursuing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/stress-less-live-more-7-mental-health-hacks-for-year-round-happiness/" target="_self"&gt;better mental and emotional well-being&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, can be linked to better cortisol regulation. The tactics mentioned above fold in several approaches that can help mitigate stress and encourage a reduction in cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you may be otherwise healthy, but your body still produces more cortisol than expected. If continuing to pursue natural methods for cortisol regulation doesn't help you, then it might be wise to speak with a medical expert and test your cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol is known as the stress hormone because it's released in higher quantities during times of stress and enhances our fight, flight or freeze reactions. When overproduced  and sustained at high levels, this hormone can cause higher stress levels and discomfort and may also contribute to physical symptoms like "cortisol face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various supplements, including vitamin C, ashwagandha, omega-3 fatty acids, Rhodiola rosea and pterostilbene, may help you lower your cortisol levels. However, there are many natural ways, like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/5-beginner-breathing-exercises-that-will-help-banish-stress/" target="_self"&gt;mindfulness breathing exercises&lt;/a&gt;, to manage stress and cortisol that may pose less risk of side effects. Some cases of high cortisol could be indications of Cushing's syndrome, in which case medical assistance will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5tYmF0UHk0cmQ1SUNHUGZlX2tRejFQaDMwTjRjVFFaUkNtMjMtY0V5SzNGM0UzRWxUUnh3akVWb2hvd1lXZnB2VTNEUXBCRmZkSG1BTVJYLU9NMUNOWmZZN3otRW1WS3NLY1AtVGJYanh1UQ</guid></item><item><title>An Interview With My Cat About His Most Annoying Behaviors - Defector</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOT1JkOE5NSVFyLVIxek9oUXlsWDVOZjlFeW8zaUJtX1hjMEVoOTRGYy10dTJqQTRvM0ZpRU1EbWp4Qm55anUzX09qcTVnNHZVODhMeWNzdTJsbldJSmRrZHpJQ2ZfVGY2UUFqYnctVFh2eWtOYTZzRXppSzBfWW9IVERaVFN2dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="PostContent_content__FblEJ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This week we're running a small package of essays on the topic of &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://defector.com/tag/nuisances" target="_blank"&gt;nuisances&lt;/a&gt;. Why? That's an annoying question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like every other member of my generation who has put off traditional markers of adulthood, like home ownership and having children, I am completely, utterly devoted to my cat, Pong. In the five years he’s lived with us, Pong has evolved from the scrawny street cat we adopted in the Union Square Petco to the ruler of our household. We often quote a decade-old Adam Serwer tweet about his own cats: Management doesn’t need a union. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve invented a rich mythology for Pong’s inner life over the last five years. His hardscrabble early years taught him to flirt and charm for his meals on the streets of Harlem, where he developed his taste for French fries, noodles, and pizza. He ran with a tough crew that wasn’t afraid to get into scraps if he needed to assert dominance. He inherited his asthma and anxiety from his mother (me), and he spends his days working hard (sleeping on a chair in my office) for the money to pay our rent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any relationship, you fall into rhythms built around each other’s quirks and scar tissue. This is true even—or maybe especially—when the relationship is with an animal who cannot speak English. We’ve come to accept his most annoying behaviors; his loafing on our backs at 5 a.m. like a sleep paralysis demon is just a part of life with Pong, as are the lost hours of sleep and frequent yelling when he can’t find us in the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been curious about meeting with a pet communicator, a type of psychic who can allegedly connect with your pet on the spiritual plane and translate their animal thoughts to English words. Against my better judgment, I am woo woo-curious and have spent hundreds of dollars on supernatural services over the years like aura readings, natal charts, and tarot spreads. Do I believe that animal communicators are 100-percent saying what they claim to do? Not necessarily. But I don't &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; believe in them, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got a recommendation for a pet communicator, whose identity I’m keeping private at their request, and booked a 30-minute session with them. We met on Zoom, and when they started looking for his energy, they asked if he’s a male, six to eight years old, who’s very sure of himself. Pong was sleeping next to me in a little kitty croissant but the communicator couldn't see him on screen. I told them they had the right guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is an interview with Pong, through the communicator, which I’ve edited for clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, I’m very tired this morning because you were super active last night, walking around the bed, pawing at our faces, and talking to us. I feel like you do this more often when we’ve recently been traveling. What’s going on? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to catch up. You come back from a trip with all these new smells and I want to reconnect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator said here that they were noticing a bit of insecurity too, which Pong wouldn’t say himself.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything I can do to help you with the insecurity you feel when we leave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not anything that you're doing wrong  It's more just like when somebody leaves and you miss them. It doesn't matter if they say, “I'll come back and I'll bring you a souvenir or something.” You're still going to miss them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, that makes sense. I do wish you'd let us sleep through the night, though. Something else I wanted to bring up: It seems like you really don’t like it when either of us goes into the bathroom. You stand outside the door and cry, and stick your paw under the door in the most desperate way. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are you keeping me out? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, it’s basically like a human litter box, and we want to have some private time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No need to keep me out, though. I’m not worried about you in there, but I just want you to remember I’m here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator noted again that they were picking up on insecurity, like a mild separation anxiety, which was interesting because the first thing they noticed about Pong was his confidence. Maybe a bit of bravado?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there something you’d like to do in the bathroom together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sounds of the water are interesting. We could go at that together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mean play with the water? You do seem pretty curious about the shower and bathtub. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to bathe in it, but I’m curious about how the water moves. It’s like a science experiment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator recommended I look into water enrichment toys for cats.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell me anything about your life before you came to live with us? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t a loving family, but there were two or three people who took care of me on the street. There was one man who I had a strong relationship with. There was a misunderstanding, the people tried to bring me into the house, and then took me away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This made me think of Alex, the doorman who apparently fed him when he was a stray, and who he was named for when he was brought to Union Square. Yes, we should’ve kept that name.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m sorry that happened, but I hope you’re happy now that you’ve been with us! One thing I’ve noticed about you is that you don’t really have much of a hunting instinct. If there is ever a bug in the house, you might watch it or bat at it, but you won’t stalk and kill it. We’re going to be moving pretty soon, and there’s a good chance that we’re moving somewhere that will have a mouse problem. Do you think you could help us with that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uh … what am I supposed to do with a mouse? Do I eat it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t think we’d want you to eat it. You could maybe bring it to us, but that’s kind of gross. I guess ideally I’d want you to just scare them away so they aren’t a problem. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you don’t want me to be friends with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, that would probably not be ideal.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hm … all right. I’m not really sure what to expect, but  I'm just going to do my thing and just chill, maybe they'll get the hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I appreciate that. OK, one last question. Sometimes you’ll crawl up onto my lap and be really sweet and snuggly, and then out of nowhere you’ll start attacking me, biting me and breaking skin. It really sucks when that happens! What’s going on? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like I’m back on the street and it just happens. It feels right in the moment, but when you get upset I feel ashamed. I saw the tissues with the blood last week and I feel bad. It’s not your fault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks. Last week was rough and my fingers are still healing from it! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator told him that when he starts to feel emotional like that, the best thing he can do is to walk away.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, I can work on that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you. I love you! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Call ended.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Defector</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 15:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOT1JkOE5NSVFyLVIxek9oUXlsWDVOZjlFeW8zaUJtX1hjMEVoOTRGYy10dTJqQTRvM0ZpRU1EbWp4Qm55anUzX09qcTVnNHZVODhMeWNzdTJsbldJSmRrZHpJQ2ZfVGY2UUFqYnctVFh2eWtOYTZzRXppSzBfWW9IVERaVFN2dw</guid></item><item><title>First measles death is reported in the West Texas outbreak that's infected more than 120 people -

						Police are warning beachgoers on Sunset Beach in North Carolina to be aware of dead birds. The Sunset Police Department said officers are aware of multiple deceased common loons in the area. Police said they cannot confirm if bird flu is the cause due to state laboratories being overwhelmed with samples."For your safety, please do not touch or handle any deceased birds or wildlife," a Facebook post from police said. "Proper disposal protocols are being followed. If you come across any additional deceased birds or other animals, please contact the Sunset Beach Police Department immediately via 911."

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;By now, many people have heard that a diet packed with ultraprocessed foods is not good for us. They have been linked to a host of ills, including obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/health/ultraprocessed-food-disease-wellness/index.html"&gt;diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10512104/" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive decline and stroke&lt;/a&gt; — they even appear to increase our &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;chance of early death&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00123b6mq8stdh7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultraprocessed foods, according to the &lt;a href="https://ecuphysicians.ecu.edu/wp-content/pv-uploads/sites/78/2021/07/NOVA-Classification-Reference-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA Food Classification system&lt;/a&gt;, are food products made with ingredients you wouldn’t normally find in a supermarket or your kitchen (such as certain individual nutrients, flavor enhancers, colors, additives, stabilizers); they might also be made using &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/health/predigested-food-wellness/index.html"&gt;industrial manufacturing processes &lt;/a&gt;(such as extrusion, molding and preprocessing) not available to the home chef.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00133b6mkpfzov3x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But anyone who has ever munched on a bag of cheese puffs, heated a frozen pizza for dinner, packed cookies in their kid’s lunch bag or downed a refreshing soda knows these foods can be tasty and convenient. They are also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6558394/" target="_blank"&gt;often cheaper&lt;/a&gt; than making a dish from scratch, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/health/child-addiction-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness/index.html"&gt;hard to resist&lt;/a&gt; (thanks to hyper-palatability formulations) and even harder to avoid: &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/8/1704" target="_blank"&gt;Up to 70% of the US food supply&lt;/a&gt; is made up of ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00143b6mhppyw6xa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet many questions remain: Are they all bad? And exactly what can make them unhealthy. That’s why researchers are asking whether some of those chemicals, additives and flavorings &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/health/red-40-food-dyes-wellness/index.html"&gt;are somehow harmful&lt;/a&gt;? Or do some of these ingredients interact with our bodies through &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/20/health/no-calorie-ultraprocessed-food-depression-wellness/index.html"&gt;our microbiome or our immune system&lt;/a&gt;, unleashing downstream health effects that we don’t yet understand? Or do ultraprocessed foods &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10924027/" target="_blank"&gt;cause us to gain weight,&lt;/a&gt; which in turn sets us up for conditions that are associated with obesity, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l41kc000003b6m25yr3pmq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers like Dr. Kevin Hall, a section chief at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (part of the National Institutes of Health), are trying to find out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00173b6mq306hank@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall and his team authored &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7" target="_blank"&gt;a groundbreaking study published in 2019&lt;/a&gt;  that found people on an ultraprocessed diet ate on average 500 more calories a day than people on a similar but minimally processed diet (matched for calories offered, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00183b6m3ebi9rpr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, Hall and his team &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-us-dietary-guidelines-wellness/index.html"&gt;are conducting a new trial&lt;/a&gt; to try to understand the mechanisms driving people to overconsume calories. He has two theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00193b6mvneebyj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One is their energy density — so how many calories you’re getting in each gram of food you’re eating,” CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on the Chasing Life podcast. Tirrell visited Hall’s lab to meet one of the participants of his new trial, which (like the first trial) involves living at the NIH for about four weeks and eating diets made up of differently processed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b001a3b6ms3cmh1uw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It so happens that ultraprocessed foods are &lt;a href="https://inddex.nutrition.tufts.edu/data4diets/indicator/percent-energy-comprised-ultra-processed-foods" target="_blank"&gt;much more energy-dense&lt;/a&gt; than minimally processed foods,” Tirrell said. “And (Hall) says, really, that’s because they take a lot of the water out of them so that they don’t rot. They’re more shelf stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b001b3b6m1biwxw2e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And then the other thing (Hall’s) hypothesizing is their hyper-palatability, or we’ve heard the term the ‘bliss point.’ So, it’s this combination of salt, sugar, fat and carbs in just the right levels that make us not want to stop eating foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm7jfejuj00023b6mfylz499l@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7kynsyo000x3b6mssncypnr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall’s new trial is studying 36 people, for one month each, cycling them through four diets. “One is minimally processed; one is ultraprocessed — very similar to the first trial: high hyper-palatability, high energy-dense,” Tirrell explained. “And then two other diets … they’re ultraprocessed, but they vary how hyper-palatable they are and how energy-dense they are.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001e3b6m5bsrgsij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And what (Hall’s) trying to see is — can you eat a diet that’s made up mostly of ultraprocessed foods, but that doesn’t drive overeating, and perhaps all of the other health effects of that, if it’s less energy-dense or if it’s less hyper-palatable?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001f3b6mmvcvmaz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not everyone views ultraprocessed foods as problematic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001g3b6meb3jrc2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities,” Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy at the Consumer Brands Association, said in an emailed statement. CBA is the trade group that represents the US manufacturers of consumer packaged goods, including food and beverages.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001h3b6mqw7vgtji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Companies adhere to the rigorous evidence-based safety standards established by the FDA to deliver safe, affordable and convenient products that consumers depend on every day,” Gallo said. She also noted there is currently no agreed-upon scientific definition of ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001i3b6masiirad6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tera Fazzino, an associate professor of psychology and the associate director of the Cofrin Logan Center for Addiction Research and Treatment at the University of Kansas, knows a thing or two about ultraprocessed foods and hyper-palatability. She developed a system to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31689013/" target="_blank"&gt;measure the hyper-palatability of different foods&lt;/a&gt;. She also collaborated with Hall and two of his NIH colleagues on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00688-4" target="_blank"&gt;a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; that found hyper-palatable foods, energy-dense foods and eating rate are all linked to more calories being consumed on four different diets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001j3b6mquxvuylh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Hyper-palatable foods contain combinations of palatability-related nutrients — so, fat, sugar, sodium and starchy carbohydrates — at thresholds that aren’t typically found together in nature,” she explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001k3b6ml0twcu7r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino said hyper-palatable foods activate our brain’s opioid receptors and our dopamine reward neurocircuitry, which leads us to keep eating and seek out more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001l3b6m2sx3kmtz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The problem with hyper-palatable foods is, due to their nutrient combinations, they are particularly strong reinforcers,” she said. “They can be acutely rewarding to consume in the moment. And they can also garner a really strong motivational drive for us to continue seeking out and consuming these foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001m3b6md9mpc3ex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino’s research found hyper-palatable foods fall into three categories. “One group has elevated fat and sodium; a second group has elevated fat and sugar. And then the third group has elevated starchy carbohydrates and sodium,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001n3b6mgkuyqbke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat and sodium hyper-palatable foods are a lot of our meal-based items, things that we eat on the regular,” she explained. “That would be meat-based dishes, mixed dishes like meat and mashed potatoes, and things like that.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001o3b6m8zdjt6yf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat and sugar (group) really are the sweets, the desserts,” she said. “The starchy carbohydrate and sodium hyper-palatable foods are a lot of our snacks. So, things that maybe even might not seem so problematic or so obvious as maybe (chips), like pretzels (and) most US-produced crackers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001p3b6miiv672x6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino said our bodies haven’t evolved to handle these foods. Whole foods found in nature “activate our brain reward neuro-circuitry and that’s a survival process,” she said. “Eating is fundamentally … a reinforcement-based process, and it needs to be enjoyable to make sure that we survive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001q3b6mlp70an1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hyper-palatable foods hijack that process because they are engineered to hit &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/19/health/bliss-point-addictive-food/index.html"&gt;the bliss point&lt;/a&gt; with their magic combination of fat, sugar, sodium and starchy carbohydrates, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001r3b6mcqjl1q8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That is creating almost like this euphoric experience that doesn’t typically come from whole foods,” she explained. “And the problem with that is that that has underlying neurobiological   impacts. It’s excessively activating our brain reward neural circuitry that already happens with whole foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001s3b6maq7i0w21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why it’s all too easy to overindulge in those foods, she said. “They can cause us to overeat in the moment, but then also there’s this kind of feedback loop where they can become really strong reinforcers and drive our behavior in a way that whole and foundational foods don’t and shouldn’t.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001t3b6mv9dv034m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unfortunately, these foods are at the heart of the US food supply and have been growing. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37794529/" target="_blank"&gt;One of Fazzino’s studies&lt;/a&gt; found the prevalence of ultraprocessed, hyper-palatable and high energy-dense foods were all significantly higher in 2018 compared with 1988.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001u3b6mxx5365le@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And there is plenty of overlap between the three categories. “When we look at the food supply over time, by the time we get to 2018, we see that the vast majority of ultraprocessed foods are also hyper-palatable,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001v3b6m3zxpc1qt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What can you do to manage the amount of hyper-palatable foods you consume? Fazzino has these five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001w3b6mb712qb05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pay attention to how your food is affecting you as you are eating it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of001x3b6mevjjlq4c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino suggested this experiment: If you’re eating a bag of potato chips, does your brain tell you, get the next one, get the next one — before you have even swallowed? Or when you’re almost done with the bag, does your body tell you that you want more?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of001y3b6mdn759zjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In contrast with, when you eat an apple, none of that extra stuff is going to be happening,” she said. “It’s going to be pleasant and you’re going to stop when you’re full.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of001z3b6ma4wxxzgi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Try to add foods to your diet that are whole and occurring in nature, which means they haven’t had anything done to them, Fazzino said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00203b6mj02v8bzy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whole foods that occur in nature, Fazzino said, typically have “one palatability-related nutrient,” such as the sugar in a whole apple.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00213b6mxu2oy3c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those whole foods also include “satiety-promoting nutrients such as fiber, water and protein that slow their absorption and digestion into our system,” she said, noting that they won’t cause us to overeat or create a strong motivational drive to seek them out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00223b6mu8ubsauo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pay attention to the amount of salt in foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00233b6m8g1x96hz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One really robust commonality that we found in this work has been the presence of sodium as a nutrient that, when combined with either fat or starchy carbohydrates, can really be a vehicle for hyper-palatability,” Fazzino said, explaining that sodium “activates the opioid system in the brain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00243b6m0bg2gwev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We are often told to reduce sodium overall for our heart health, she said, but salt is not as well-known for contributing to hyper-palatability as fat and sugar are.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00253b6msaq91dgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no magic sodium number or threshold used to determine whether the amount of salt in a particular food contributes to hyper-palatability. But Fazzino recommends people look for low-sodium options in the cracker aisle or the frozen dinner section, for example.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00263b6mudvet2ei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino also encouraged home cooks to keep sodium in mind, since a lot of ingredients have added salt. (Be mindful of the butter, cheese and sausage bits you may be adding to your omelet.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00273b6mkhy0btka@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Go light on what you add,” she said. “That will help to avoid the hyper-palatability piece.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00283b6mxrrezemw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stay away from food labels touting properties such as “diet,” “reduced fat” or “lean,” Fazzino recommended.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00293b6m13eot0i5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of the diet foods, as we found in our analysis of the food system, are hyper-palatable,” she said. Without the bliss point engineering, she noted, those foods would not be as palatable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002a3b6mn3vlu917@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And when one key ingredient is reduced, another is often increased. These food products are marketed with less fat, for example, but maybe they contain more added sugar, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7l3a5dd002j3b6mplbveb2f@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="understand-the-deck-is-stacked-against-you" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Understand the deck is stacked against you
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002b3b6miqzplb23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Be aware that hyper-palatable foods are designed to entice you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002c3b6mlz8w7sk8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re designed to be difficult to resist and difficult to stop eating Fazzino said. “And it’s not the individual’s fault.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002d3b6mwqhh0nij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, Fazzino said systemic changes may be needed to meaningfully address the prevalence of these foods in the food supply.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7kyhmip000m3b6mykktjlig@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Where a young American woman lives could play a role in her risk for &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/women-health/what-is-metastatic-breast-cancer-how-is-it-treated-2661662925.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the breast cancer risk associated with a young woman’s locale is comparable to that from other known factors, such as genetics, researchers reported in a new study published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10552-025-01968-7"&gt;Cancer Causes &amp;amp; Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Breast cancer incidence is increasing in U.S. women under 40, but until now, it was unknown if incidence trends varied by U.S. geographic region,” lead researcher &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/rebecca-kehm-phd"&gt;Rebecca Kehm&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer among women under 40 increased by 0.5% a year between 2001 and 2020 across the United States, according to researchers’ analysis of cancer statistics drawn from all 50 states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that increase appears to have been driven by 21 states where early-onset breast cancer cases exceeded that average rate of increase, results show. Rates remained stable or decreased in the other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, 12 states had a statistically significant increase in breast cancer rates among young women during that period -- Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Louisiana, California, Colorado and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breast cancer rate was 32% higher in the five states with the highest overall rates -- Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Hawaii and Connecticut – than in the five states with the lowest rates, researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idaho, North Dakota, Arizona, Utah and Wyoming had the lowest breast cancer rates, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Western states had the highest rate of increase between 2001 and 2020, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northeast had the highest overall rate among women under 40 and experienced a significant increase over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South was the only region where breast cancer in young women did not increase over the period, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The increase in incidence we are seeing is alarming and cannot be explained by genetic factors alone, which evolve over much longer periods, nor by changes in screening practices, given that women under 40 years are below the recommended age for routine mammography screening,” Kehm said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that doctors might consider location along with other risk factors in assessing a woman’s potential risk for breast cancer, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “may improve our ability to identify groups of younger women at higher risk for early-onset breast cancer,” the team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer research also might focus on state-specific risk factors for breast cancer, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example could be laws that regulate alcohol consumption, which is an established risk factor for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White women were the only group to experience a statistically significant increase in early-onset breast cancer rates across all four regions of the U.S., results showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black women had the highest overall rates of early-onset breast cancer across the country, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, whole foods high in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9787832/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; support the microbiome, while certain &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38388570/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; can have a negative impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that the microbiota — including bacteria, fungi, virus, and other microbes — [that] naturally live in our gut are important for our overall health, immune function, and various health conditions,” &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/li-jiao-23845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Li Jiao, MD, MS, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor in the Department of Medicine-Gastroenterology at Baylor College of Medicine told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our diet affects our health through the gut microbiota, at least partially. If we fully understand how food impacts the trillions of bacteria in our gut, we can better maintain gut health, overall health, and provide evidence-based dietary guidelines. We would be able to use tailored nutrition approaches to prevent and manage diseases in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiao is the senior author of a new study recently published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/3/567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, providing evidence that different types of dairy products affect the gut microbiome differently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, Jiao and her team found that drinking more &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/273451" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; was correlated to an increase in two types of bacteria that may support gut health, while consuming more &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/299147" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt; was linked to lower amounts of a third beneficial type of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers’ final analysis included samples from 34 people who had a scheduled colonoscopy between August 2013 and April 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study excluded people with a family history of colon diseases or IBD, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322428" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;colorectal polyps&lt;/a&gt; within the previous 3 years, and those with other conditions or taking medications that could affect the study results. People who had recently changed their eating habits were also excluded from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants’ provided information on their intake of total dairy, milk, cheese, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/295714" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt; via a self-reported questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We set out to study dairy products and their impacts on gut bacteria for two main reasons,” Jiao explained. “One, fermented foods are thought to influence gut microbiota. Many dairy products, such as yogurt and cheese, are fermented foods. Two, there is still some debate about whether milk and cheese are good for our health. This study [was] meant to provide more biological evidence about [the] health impacts of milk and cheese.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon analysis, scientists discovered that participants who consumed more total dairy and milk, and those who ate less cheese, appeared to have a higher alpha-microbial diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The variety of species plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall health and stability of the ecosystem,” Jiao explained. “Having higher alpha-diversity in the gut means a healthier and more balanced gut microbiota community.“&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A diverse microbiota is more resilient to external disturbance such as infections, changes in diet, and antibiotic use, allowing for a quicker recovery. It is like a forest with many different types of trees [that] can recover faster from natural disasters,” she detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current research suggests that the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18871-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;composition of the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, or the abundance of specific types of bacteria present, may be an even better indicator of gut health than alpha-diversity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists observed that participants who ate higher amounts of cheese had a lower amount of the bacterium &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; in their gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past studies provide conflicting evidence on the health effects of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt;. Some research suggests this bacterium produces toxins that &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29398651/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;promote tumor formation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; and are associated with &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28151975/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;colorectal cancer development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;. However, low levels of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; have also been linked to &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27999802/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;IBD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; are among the common bacteria in our body and some of their species offer health benefits,” Jiao said. “In the large intestine, &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; help digest food, absorb nutrients, and promote gut health. We found that middle-aged men [who] consumed higher amounts of cheese had less abundant of these beneficial bacteria in the gut, making higher cheese consumption less helpful in our study population.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Meanwhile, higher consumption of cheese [reduced] was related to a lower diversity of the gut bacteria in our study. However, some species of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Therefore, interpreting the results is not straightforward. More research is needed to understand the different strains of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides &lt;/em&gt;and their roles in the human body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Li Jiao, MD, MS, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiao and her team also observed that those who consumed more total diary and milk had a higher amount of the bacteria &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10410495/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9300896/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in their microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animal studies, &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; also shows potential in helping prevent chronic conditions like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8161007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11510203/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; are two common bacteria essential for a healthy gut,” Jiao explained. “Both can help regulate the immune system, reduce inflammation, and promote a healthy gut. Akkermansia, in addition, helps maintain and strengthen the gut lining. They are considered beneficial for our health based on the current evidence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Milk and dairy products may help promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, supporting the idea that milk is good for our health,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people who aren’t &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/180120" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;lactose intolerant&lt;/a&gt;, consumption of low-fat dairy products may boost these beneficial bacteria and the diversity of the gut microbiota. Those with lactose intolerance issues may opt for yogurt, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318353" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;kefir&lt;/a&gt;, lactose-free dairy, or dairy alternatives. However, it is important to pay attention to how your body responds to dairy products,” the researcher cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/gastroenterology/ca/santa-monica/rudolph-bedford-1902885684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Rudolph Bedford, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It makes sense in that the process of &lt;a href="https://www.idfa.org/pasteurization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;pasteurizing&lt;/a&gt; cheese versus what we do with milk are quite different, and there are different potential bacteria that are involved in either both processes or what’s actually left after the process is finished,” Bedford, who was not involved in the study, told us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these recent findings, Bedford said people who have&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;IBD or other gut-related diseases may want to consider drinking more milk and eating less cheese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“But obviously, I think that much more research needs to be done,” he cautioned. “In terms of patients with things like inflammatory bowel disease, we’re encouraging more of a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324221" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; these days, which does incorporate various dairy-like products, yogurts, and things of that sort.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d like [researchers] to break down the types of cheeses that are actually associated with lowering the &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; colonies, and whether or not the processing of the cheeses really has more to do with that than not,” Bedford added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:23:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQbVdwSV9CcURIZ1JWNlQwMzE5NDAwdXZZczN1V2xac2JEZXBKcUcwRmZKc2NqdXVjaXo4S20tcGpqa1VZMXZ4eC1IRnlocnFjd1JzVWtDX2VIVGtlOTlnOHc2aDctb1otT1N3aWxBX0dWTWVkVGI2dWp2blRkTUkwd2dwT3U0YVlSWTBTTl9fdGlqUHJXQ2pCOVdiblZwVEVK</guid></item><item><title>Killing 166 million birds hasn't helped poultry farmers stop H5N1.

Three years later, highly pathogenic avian influenza has spread to all 50 states. The number of commercial birds that have died or been killed &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html" target="_blank"&gt;exceeds 166 million&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-06/nearly-9-a-dozen-why-egg-prices-are-skyrocketing-and-for-how-long"&gt;the price of eggs&lt;/a&gt; is at an all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poultry producers, infectious disease experts and government officials now concede that H5N1 is likely here to stay. That recognition is prompting some of them to question whether the long-standing practice of culling every single bird on an infected farm is sustainable over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they are discussing such strategies as targeted depopulation, vaccinations, and even the relocation of wetlands and bodies of water to lure virus-carrying wild birds away from poultry farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But each of these alternatives entails a variety of logistical, economic and environmental costs that may eclipse the intended savings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People talk about common-sense solutions to bird flu,” said &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/maurice-ernest-pitesky" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Maurice Pitesky&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinarian and commercial poultry expert at UC Davis. “But that’s what mass culling is.

And most will blackball a nation’s entire poultry portfolio, even if just one region or type of poultry is infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. exports more than &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/u-s-broiler-exports-quantity-and-share-of-production/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6.7 billion pounds of chicken meat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; each year, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/statistic/broiler-industry-key-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;second only to Brazil&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Chicken Council. So as long as foreign buyers are resistant to vaccination, the shots probably won’t be deployed even if egg-laying hens are getting wiped out by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As members of the U.S. Congressional and Senate Chicken Caucuses &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Letter-to-USDA-Re-HPAI-Vaccine.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a letter&lt;/a&gt; this month to the USDA, “if an egg-laying hen in Michigan is vaccinated for HPAI, the U.S. right now would likely be unable to export an unvaccinated broiler chicken from Mississippi.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new H5N2 vaccine might allay such concerns. While it would offer protection against H5N1, it would elicit antibodies that look distinct from the ones that arise from an actual infection, Cardona said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitesky said that none of these measures will work if we don’t do a better job with flu surveillance and farm placement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildlife and agriculture officials should ramp up their testing of wild birds to determine where the virus is moving and how it is evolving, he said. That will require global coordination because infected birds can travel back and forth between the U.S., Canada, Russia, East Asia and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poultry farms near ponds, lagoons or wetlands that attract wild birds should be on high alert during migration season, Pitesky said. Farmers should use apps such as &lt;a class="link" href="https://ebird.org/home" target="_blank"&gt;eBird&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://birdcast.info/" target="_blank"&gt;BirdCast &lt;/a&gt;or the &lt;a class="link" href="https://waterfowlalertnetwork.com/tracker/" target="_blank"&gt;Waterfowl Alert Network&lt;/a&gt; to keep tabs on when the birds are nearby so they can step up their biosecurity measures as needed, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be possible to lure wild birds away from agricultural facilities by bolstering wetlands in more remote areas, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I keep pushing the idea of starting to reflood some of those wetlands, but we haven’t done it in any kind of strategic fashion,” Pitesky said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea makes sense, but has been brushed off as “pie in the sky, which I push back on,” he said. “I’m like, what we’re doing right now is obviously not working.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxONnI5Z3V2VDJ6c0pTN3BmM2tuQWIxajg5Rng2R2RNaHBWcHFfdjdweC1Qal9kb1kyRTJNRDBSZXVsVzBQSGpWTk5DUXVmdnBwZy1KOTlYZlVkZ1pza01ydE9NM3NaT3U3LXY2QnMwZURjak04TGhBT1ZmVC1mLTFHdDU2bFZxMUxGQTdVdmNOb0lIdG1qUHp3cU1aMWc</guid></item><item><title>Diagnostic dilemma: Teen's improbable pregnancy occurred after oral sex - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxObDdCMUNkbWpyRVZkdEtSQnphejc5Q1pyOGJZNlI0V045UnJlRDI5Tk5LcmFEVVM5T0o0YmZDTkpJbk9wSmo3VWFQdVl0eTJJTE95ejZmN0tyUkh1YTRZSFZYSFdnVzlacGpodzdLVVZRMkh0OGJRY09BczNmU1RoaGVOTk11TW5LV2Y1M2NlMkxydXNJejBOWjkzVEtTd3hwVVR1RHJ0clJHQjJ3YkdtTTVBOWxVSU9YVGo2eWRRNURfcjViV29GbjlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 15-year-old girl in Lesotho, Southern Africa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;In 1988, a teen visited the hospital with intermittent and acute abdominal pain. An examination revealed that she was about nine months pregnant — but she said she had been unaware of the pregnancy. Her uterus was contracting at regular intervals and the fetus was oriented with its head downward in the birth canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;When emergency room doctors inspected the patient's vulva, they found no vaginal opening. Instead, there was a skin-covered shallow indentation between her labia minora — the vulva's inner lips — and below her urethral meatus, the external opening of the urethra that transports urine out of the bladder. This rare condition, in which the vaginal opening is absent or closed, is known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655474/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655474/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;distal vaginal atresia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and affects an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655474/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655474/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimated 1 in 4,000 to 10,000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; newborn females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors gave the patient spinal anaesthesia and performed an emergency cesarean section (C-section), delivering a healthy baby boy weighing 6.2 pounds (2.8 kilograms), according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3191066/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3191066/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examination of the patient after her delivery revealed that her uterus terminated in a vagina that was just 0.8 inches (2 centimeters) deep, according to the case report. (Vaginal depth is typically 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) but can extend up to 8 inches (20 cm) during arousal.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient had previously visited the same emergency room 278 days, or just over nine months, earlier,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;after a man stabbed her in the upper abdomen. The knife had penetrated her abdominal wall and created two wounds in her stomach. At the time, doctors treated her injuries and discharged her from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months later, as the patient was recovering from the cesarean operation, she told a nurse that the attack occurred when an ex-lover had found her fellating her new boyfriend. The doctors concluded that, after the patient was stabbed, sperm she had swallowed migrated to her reproductive organs through the tears in her digestive tract, thus causing her pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-idrmu5KrtJ8ih32eTtjpK3" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-idrmu5KrtJ8ih32eTtjpK3 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient's recovery was uneventful, and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;she and her boyfriend ultimately accepted the circumstances of the child's conception, the report added. A few years later, the boy visibly resembled his father — the man she had been fellating at the time of the attack — a fact that "excludes an even more miraculous conception," the emergency room physician wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Fertilization typically occurs after sperm is introduced to the female reproductive system through the vagina. Environments that are highly acidic, such as the gastrointestinal tract, are inhospitable to sperm. However, saliva is lower in acid than other parts of the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acidity is measured by the pH scale, which runs from 0 to 14 — the lower the number, the more acid is present. The stomach is acidic, with a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-tests/stomach-acid-test" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-tests/stomach-acid-test" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pH of 1.5 to 3.5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Saliva typically has a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3800408/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3800408/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pH of 6.7&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on average, which is close to neutral. This could explain why the sperm in this case was still viable after being swallowed, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, when people are malnourished, the digestive system becomes less acidic and more alkaline, the doctor wrote. The patient was underfed at the time of the knifing, which may have provided a more hospitable environment for the swallowed sperm as it traveled from her digestive system and passed through the knife wounds in her stomach to enter her uterus, the doctor theorized in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-idrmu5KrtJ8ih32eTtjpK3-p3R3m1EajKJArbn2NdWNkCgdl1Cuemal" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-idrmu5KrtJ8ih32eTtjpK3-p3R3m1EajKJArbn2NdWNkCgdl1Cuemal slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When it comes to surviving radiation, tardigrades really know their stuff, shrugging off doses that would annihilate most other life forms. Now researchers are using this knowledge to find ways to protect healthy cells during  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="153279" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team led by Ameya Kirtane from Harvard Medical School and Jianling Bi from the University of Iowa has isolated this superpower in the form of messenger RNA, which when injected into cells protects them from radiation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people undergo radiotherapy for cancer, it's not just the tumor that suffers. The radiation causes DNA breaks in healthy cells, too, leading to massive cell death and inflammation, which is responsible for the treatment's unpleasant side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It can manifest as something as simple as mouth sores, which can limit a person's ability to eat because it's so painful, to requiring hospitalization because people are suffering so terribly from the pain, weight loss, or bleeding," University of Iowa radiation oncologist James Byrne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074707?"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite their cute monikers like moss piglet and water bear, the microscopic, eight-legged animals known as tardigrades are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-adorable-little-animals-will-survive-nearly-any-global-apocalypse"&gt;&lt;span&gt;notoriously tough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Aside from surviving the hottest setting of your oven and pressures of 7.5 Gpa, they can handle &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770827/"&gt;around a thousand times&lt;/a&gt; the dose of ionizing radiation that would kill a human. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can do this because of their ability to produce a unique protein Dsup (short for 'damage suppressing'), which helps them tolerate both the initial blast and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-figured-out-how-tardigrades-survive-x-ray-bombardment"&gt;hydroxyl radicals&lt;/a&gt; that form in cells as a result, which would otherwise tear up one or even both strands of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-figured-out-how-tardigrades-survive-x-ray-bombardment"&gt;had their eyes on this protein&lt;/a&gt; as a potential aid to cancer treatment since &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12808"&gt;it was discovered in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and now they're one step closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-3uNVu6sqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That 2016 study showed that when expressed in human cells, Dsup reduces X-ray-induced DNA damage by about 40 percent, which is why the researchers are hopeful it could protect cancer patients from the serious side-effects of their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dsup has to be inside a cell's nucleus to work. Delivering this protein directly into each cell is not feasible, and integrating the genes for Dsup directly into DNA has its own risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the strengths of our approach is that we are using a messenger RNA, which just temporarily expresses the protein, so it's considered far safer than something like DNA, which may be incorporated into the cells' genome," Kirtane &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074707?"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By wrapping the mRNA in specific polymer-lipid nanoparticles (one design best-suited to the colon, and one ideal for the mouth) they were able to smuggle the strands into lab-grown cells where they were used to generate large amounts of Dsup before disintegrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We thought that perhaps by combining these two systems – polymers and lipids – we may be able to get the best of both worlds and get highly potent RNA delivery. And that's essentially what we saw," Kirtane &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074707?"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, delivering the Dsup in mRNA 'recipe' format also prevents the protective tardigrade armor from sneaking their way into cells the radiation is supposed to kill, such as those making up the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure this works in action, the team injected Dsup-encoding mRNA into mice who, 6 hours later, received a dose of radiation roughly equivalent to one that might be administered to a human cancer patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group of mice received mRNA treatment and radiation to the mouth; the other, to the rectum. And some extra mice were given the radiation without the protection of Dsup, to provide a baseline for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153378" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153378" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-153378" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation.png 1992w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-642x267.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-998x415.png 998w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-768x319.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-1536x638.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-600x249.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1992px) 100vw, 1992px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153378" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It's still a long way off human use, but the delivery of tardigrade Dsup protein mRNA shows promise. (Kirtane et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'rectal' group experienced about half as many radiation-induced double-stranded DNA breaks, compared with controls that did not receive Dsup protection. The 'mouth' group had about one third of the breaks of their peers. And the mRNA treatment seemed to have no effect on tumor volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is just the beginning: the sample sizes were very small, and of course, we can't predict how human bodies will react to a treatment based solely on tests on lab-grown cells or mice. But it's enough to prompt further investigation, especially now they know they can get the mRNA safely into a cell without conferring the benefit on the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The use of Dsup mRNA delivery may be co-opted for several other clinical applications, including protection of normal tissue from DNA-damaging chemotherapies or progressive degeneration of specific tissues, cancer predisposition, chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents," the authors &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01360-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition to cancer-related applications, the use of Dsup protein can be extended to total body exposure to space radiation or as prophylaxis against nuclear radiation exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01360-5"&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind the paper, told DailyMail.com she understands the pre-print, which was not peer-reviewed but published on website MedRxiv, could be seen as controversial &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain fog is a term used to describe a range of cognitive problems that impact on daily life, such as memory difficulties, problems finding the right words and feeling overwhelmed by simple everyday tasks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tinnitus, meanwhile, is a hearing problem that most commonly takes the form of persistent ringing in the ears, but can also sound like buzzing, roaring, hissing, or clicking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When such sounds last more than six months, it's known as chronic tinnitus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insomnia is a sleep disorder that sees sufferers have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting good quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC and NHS recommend adults get between seven and nine hours of sleep on average, and people who don't get this amount regularly could have insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Persistent sleep deprivation can take a toll on people's health from irritability and reduced focus in the short term, to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e4b36540-d983-11ef-bf36-47316f776e33" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale scientists also found PVS patients could see a dormant virus in their body called Epstein-Barr reawaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than nine in 10 adults have had Epstein-Barr at some point in their lives, with it being a common infection spread through bodily fluids like saliva or semen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2022 study led by academics at Imperial College London suggests almost 20million lives were saved by Covid vaccines in the first year since countries began rolling out the jabs, the majority in wealthy nations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes symptoms like fatigue, fever, and rashes, and once symptoms disappear, the virus remains dormant in the body, where it can be reactivated when the immune system is low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the Yale team collected blood samples of 42 Americans with PVS and 22 without it, between December 2022 and November 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with the syndrome were generally in poorer health than the average American, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid vaccine, with some experiencing an onset after a third or fourth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with PVS also had elevated levels of Covid spike proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The levels in PVS patients were even greater than those found in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14255465/doctors-relief-long-covid-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;patients with long Covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a condition with similar symptoms linked to the virus itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Persistent spike proteins in the body are thought to cause some of long Covid's symptoms, by keeping the body in a constant state of inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind the paper, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14421799/yale-scientists-covid-vaccine-study-message-victims.html"&gt;told DailyMail.com&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People with PVS also had elevated levels of Covid spike proteins.

We need funding to carry out such future work.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Independent experts, however, have urged for caution over the findings.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr John Wherry, director of the Institute for Immunology at the University of Pennsylvania, said it's possible some of the excess spike protein identified in the study may be from undetected Covid infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/health/covid-post-vaccination-syndrome.html"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;: 'I would like to see more data on this topic.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/awgaffney/status/1892935347136278841"&gt;on X&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Adam Gaffney, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harvard University, also said: 'There's nothing wrong with studying vaccine side effects. There is a problem with this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're at a moment right now where the US government is undercutting people's trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it's caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mRNA Covid vaccines are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;estimated to have saved tens of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10944873/Covid-vaccines-saved-nearly-20MILLION-lives-year-worlds-roll-out.html"&gt;millions of lives globally from Covid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;1.6million in Europe and 3million in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They are also credited with helping end the series of paralyzing lockdowns brought on by the Covid pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC still recommends Covid vaccines, especially for those who are elderly or immunocompromised and vulnerable to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid is also still &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8239461/Confirmed-coronavirus-cases-surpass-800-000-death-toll-hits-42-940.html" class=""&gt;killing about 300 Americans every week&lt;/a&gt;, CDC data shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid vaccines are not currently available in the UK via the NHS, though they are expected to roll out again in the spring.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn't the first mRNA jabs have been linked to worrying side effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Global reports of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12339279/Covid-vaccine-myocarditis-heart-Elon-Musk-bronny-james.html"&gt;myocarditis&lt;/a&gt;, a potentially dangerous inflammation of the heart muscle, have also spooked health officials in the US and UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In myocarditis, it's thought that the immune system may register mRNA in Covid vaccines as a threat, leading the immune system to attack itself and cause inflammation of the myocardium, the heart's muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This same mechanism has been linked to pericarditis, which leads to inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both conditions have been linked to viruses like the common cold and hepatitis, as well as Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most cases are mild, in rare instances, myocarditis can damage the heart and make it difficult for it to pump blood, eventually leading to heart failure, heart attack, and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have found rates of myocarditis in Britain were eventually found to be lower than in the US and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts attributed this to the UK's longer intervals between doses, eight weeks compared to four, which is said to give the body more time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the &lt;span&gt;side effect is rare but exactly how rare is still being debated. Estimates range from one in 50,000 to one in 200,000. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data also showed that the risk of myocarditis from Covid itself was far higher than that from a vaccine, so experts continued to recommend the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no figures for the number of PVS patients in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a biology professor in Minnesota, was an avid mountain biker when he developed cataracts and tremors after his Moderna vaccine. He is pictured with his two children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lindy Ayers, 31, was a military veteran, triathlete, and skateboarding competitor before she was left wheelchair bound after her Covid shot. She is pictured at left before the injury and at right after&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, government data has recorded the number of people applying for compensation for injuries and deaths they believe to be caused by the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest figures, published by Parliament last month, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14416803/covid-vaccine-injury-risk-harm-killed-Brits-new-syndrome.html"&gt;show a total of 17,379&lt;/a&gt; applications had been made to the UK's Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme as of November last year, with at least 70 of these related to deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, just 194 have been deemed eligible for payment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The controversial scheme predates the Covid shots and offers some victims of vaccine injuries and deaths a one-off payment of £120,000 (about $150,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 9,196 rejected claims, 416 were done so on the grounds that, while a victim had been injured by a vaccine, they didn't meet the 60 percent disability threshold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a further 7,173 victims, or their families, are still awaiting a verdict, meaning the totals could still rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, data from the US Covid vaccine injury compensation program suggested that 14,000 people had filed claims for injury or death they claimed were caused by the vaccine as of December 2024, out of the 270million Americans who received at least one dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But only one in four claims have been reviewed, according to the Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration, an agency within the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those reviewed, 58 are 'eligible for compensation.' In order to be eligible, a person must be able to prove their injury was directly caused by a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But that's not the only bad news. Scientists have also detected bird flu in three veterinarians working with cattle, which may signal a change in the way the virus is spreading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the university, three veterinarians working with cattle have tested positive for bird flu without presenting any symptoms. In a separate statement, the &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/study-three-bovine-veterinarians-unknowingly-infected-h5n1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;American Veterinary Medical Association said&lt;/a&gt; a study found that "Among 150 practitioners tested, three had evidence of recent infection with H5N1, including two who hadn’t been exposed to animals confirmed or suspected to have H5N1 infections." One of those infected vets didn't even practice in a state with a confirmed H5N1 case. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sarah Michaels, an infectious disease expert at Tulane University’s Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, says this study and others could indicate that the virus is far more widespread than we thought. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It will be difficult to contain,” Michaels said. “Recent screenings and the national milk testing program have shown that bird flu has spilled over from wild birds to cattle more than once. And this report of infections in three veterinarians highlights the importance of rapidly identifying infected dairy cattle, continued testing of bulk milk, and monitoring human infections among those at increased risk.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for the new strain, it's known as the D1.1 variant, which Tulane explained had only been previously found in wild birds and some domestic poultry. However, now, it's not only been found in cattle but also in a Nevada dairy worker, marking the third known human case involving the variant. This follows two other high-profile cases with D1.1, including the death of a Louisiana farmer who contracted it from his backyard flock and a teenager in Canada who was hospitalized but later recovered. And now that that are two types of the virus out there, experts say it will be hard to both track and contain the spread. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s endemic in cows now. There is no way this is going to get contained,” Seema Lakdawala, an influenza virologist and co-director of the Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens at Emory School of Medicine, shared with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/bird-flu-virus-trump" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding fuel to the fire is the absolutely rampant spread of the flu in humans this winter. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20there%20have,flu%20so%20far%20this%20season." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) reported that there have been "at least 33 million illnesses, 430,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths from flu so far this season," marking one of the worst flu seasons in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;over a decade&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There’s a lot of flu going around, and so the potential for the virus to reassort right now is high,” Lakdawala additionally told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, noting there is the possibility of "reassortment" in animals.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While all this is really great, things could be worse than we know, as the Trump administration has halted communication with the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5276340/trump-centers-for-disease-control-cdc-world-health-organization" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, which is no longer receiving updates on either human flu or avian influenza.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There’s no way Americans can protect themselves from bird flu unless the Trump administration stops recklessly withholding the latest information on where and how it’s spreading,” Hannah Connor, deputy environmental health director at the Center for Biological Diversity, &lt;a href="https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/cdc-urged-to-release-bird-flu-data-as-trump-slashes-key-staff-combatting-outbreak-2025-02-24/#:~:text=Under%20Trump%20the%20CDC%20has,Morbidity%20and%20Mortality%20Weekly%20Report." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;shared in a letter co-signed by 28 public interest groups&lt;/a&gt;. “The most effective way to slow an outbreak of this magnitude is to routinely keep us all well informed.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for what you can do to protect yourself, Michaels noted that “Eggs and meat should be cooked thoroughly, and people should refrain from drinking raw milk." Emily Landon, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Chicago Medicine, echoed this sentiment in her own university's statement, noting that while the risk to humans remains is low, it's still important to stay vigilant. “The highest risk to most people would be through contaminated dairy products,” Landon noted. So, for now, it's best to avoid raw milk and unpasteurized cheese. This also goes for your pets. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As always, you should avoid contact with infected animals and wash your hands frequently if you do come in contact with any farm animals.

But that's not the only bad news. Scientists have also detected bird flu in three veterinarians working with cattle, which may signal a change in the way the virus is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the university, three veterinarians working with cattle have tested positive for bird flu without presenting any symptoms. In a separate statement, the &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/study-three-bovine-veterinarians-unknowingly-infected-h5n1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Veterinary Medical Association said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Veterinary Medical Association said&lt;/a&gt; a study found that "Among 150 practitioners tested, three had evidence of recent infection with H5N1, including two who hadn’t been exposed to animals confirmed or suspected to have H5N1 infections." One of those infected vets didn't even practice in a state with a confirmed H5N1 case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sarah Michaels, an infectious disease expert at Tulane University’s Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, says this study and others could indicate that the virus is far more widespread than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/is-it-safe-to-eat-eggs-bird-flu-8786608" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Is It Safe to Eat Eggs During a Bird Flu Outbreak?

Here’s What to Know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It will be difficult to contain,” Michaels said. “Recent screenings and the national milk testing program have shown that bird flu has spilled over from wild birds to cattle more than once. And this report of infections in three veterinarians highlights the importance of rapidly identifying infected dairy cattle, continued testing of bulk milk, and monitoring human infections among those at increased risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As for the new strain, it's known as the D1.1 variant, which Tulane explained had only been previously found in wild birds and some domestic poultry. However, now, it's not only been found in cattle but also in a Nevada dairy worker, marking the third known human case involving the variant. This follows two other high-profile cases with D1.1, including the death of a Louisiana farmer who contracted it from his backyard flock and a teenager in Canada who was hospitalized but later recovered. And now that that are two types of the virus out there, experts say it will be hard to both track and contain the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s endemic in cows now. There is no way this is going to get contained,” Seema Lakdawala, an influenza virologist and co-director of the Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens at Emory School of Medicine, shared with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/bird-flu-virus-trump" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Guardian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Adding fuel to the fire is the absolutely rampant spread of the flu in humans this winter. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20there%20have,flu%20so%20far%20this%20season." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) reported that there have been "at least 33 million illnesses, 430,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths from flu so far this season," marking one of the worst flu seasons in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:over a decade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;over a decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There’s a lot of flu going around, and so the potential for the virus to reassort right now is high,” Lakdawala additionally told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, noting there is the possibility of "reassortment" in animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While all this is really great, things could be worse than we know, as the Trump administration has halted communication with the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5276340/trump-centers-for-disease-control-cdc-world-health-organization" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, which is no longer receiving updates on either human flu or avian influenza.

The Trump administration’s withholding of those details puts us at the mercy of the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As for what you can do to protect yourself, Michaels noted that “Eggs and meat should be cooked thoroughly, and people should refrain from drinking raw milk." Emily Landon, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Chicago Medicine, echoed this sentiment in her own university's statement, noting that while the risk to humans remains is low, it's still important to stay vigilant. “The highest risk to most people would be through contaminated dairy products,” Landon noted. So, for now, it's best to avoid raw milk and unpasteurized cheese. This also goes for your pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As always, you should avoid contact with infected animals and wash your hands frequently if you do come in contact with any farm animals.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Sue Bell became one of the first Alzheimer's patients in the U.S. to receive the drug now marketed as Leqembi.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Four years later, she and her husband, Ken, halted the treatment. Sue's Alzheimer's had reached the point where her taking the drug no longer made sense.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it helped," says her husband, Ken Bell. "But I'm not sure."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That sort of uncertainty is common when it comes to&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-alzheimers-disease-treatment" target="_blank"&gt; Leqembi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-treatment-adults-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;Kisunla&lt;/a&gt;, two new Alzheimer's drugs approved since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both drugs clear the brain of a substance called beta-amyloid, which forms the sticky plaques associated with Alzheimer's. Studies show they can slow down the underlying disease process that ultimately leads to the death of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But neither drug restores memory and cognition, and the benefit to a given person varies widely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some people progress, other people do pretty well," says&lt;a href="https://physicians.wustl.edu/people/barbara-joy-snider-md-phd/" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Joy Snider&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neurology and one of Sue's doctors at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both drugs also cost more than $25,000 a year, and can cause brain swelling and bleeding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A diagnosis and a drug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue began having memory problems around 2019, when she was working as a substitute teacher.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She'd come home and she'd say, I'm having trouble spelling words and things like that," Ken told me when I visited the couple in 2023 at their home in St. Charles, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I didn't remember all that," Sue added. "That's part of the problem."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue saw her primary care doctor, then a neurologist. She got cognitive tests, brain scans, and, eventually, a diagnosis: early stage Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Sue volunteered for a study at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Researchers there were conducting part of a nationwide clinical trial of Leqembi, then known by its generic name, lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drug was the latest in a series of medications designed to clear the brain of beta-amyloid, which forms the sticky plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's. At the time, none of those drugs had been shown to slow the loss of memory and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Sue and Ken knew lecanemab was unlikely to help her.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm the kind of person that I would like to help somebody else, too." Sue said during my 2023 visit. "And that's what I was in this for."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ken hoped that if lecanemab worked even a little, "at some point maybe they would come up with something that would either reverse the symptoms or cure it even."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infusions and hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue and Ken began making twice-monthly trips to St. Louis, about 30 minutes away, where she got lecanemab by intravenous infusion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Needles don't bother me," she said, adding that she didn't experience the brain swelling or bleeding that can be side effects of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, the drug seemed to help. Sue was able to take a trip to New York.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a great trip. We had five girls," Sue said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was really six girls," Ken added softly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Oh I forgot that," Sue said. "It was very fun. We just walked all over the place."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved lecanemab/Leqembi for treating people in the earliest stage of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By then, though, Sue knew her memory was getting worse, despite the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Oh, it's waning," she said at the time. "Some days I'm better than others."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, Ken and Sue kept driving from St. Charles to St. Louis for her lecanemab infusions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-49460" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ending treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late 2024, I got an update during a video call with Ken — but not Sue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I didn't think it would help to have her participate today, honestly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tests had shown that Sue's memory and thinking had declined to the point where lecanemab was no longer a good option.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We decided that we were kind of wasting our time coming down there all the time," Ken said. "So we suspended taking the drugs."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So have many other patients in the clinical trial of lecanemab, says Snider, the Washington University neurologist who oversaw Sue's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have a few people left from that study who are still on the medication," She says. "I am surprised at how well some of them are doing."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For all of its limitations, Snider says, Leqembi represents a meaningful change in Alzheimer's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People like Sue and Ken are the reason we have a new drug, and the reason we can give hope to a lot of people with this disease," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Sue, though, hope is fading.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She still knows me, still knows our kids," Ken says. But some days, he adds, she gets lost in her own house.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On one of those days, Sue began asking Ken to move her to a care home. So Ken found one she liked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After she was there a few days, every time I would come she would say take me back home, I don't want to be here anymore," Ken says. "After a month, I brought her back home."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue is still at home, when she's not at a daycare for people with memory problems. Two days a week, Ken gets help from in-home care providers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But at some point, Ken says, his wife will probably need more care than he can arrange at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Regular doses of peanut butter and eggs before age 1 can help prevent food allergies. A baby who gnaws on spinach and soft bouquets of broccoli, with their slightly bitter flavors, is more likely to enjoy vegetables as an adult. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for what happens when babies and toddlers grow up on ultra-processed foods — well, that’s what health experts are increasingly worried about.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The global market for baby and toddler food has exploded in recent years, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10140693/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;more than doubling&lt;/a&gt; from $33.2 billion in 2010 to $67.9 billion in 2022. Offerings go well beyond the arrowroot biscuits and jars of puree that older generations may remember, with snacks and finger foods making up &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39203918/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;20% of products in the category&lt;/a&gt;. Beckoning from grocery store shelves are coconut-mango melts and light-as-air sweet potato puffs; “growing-up” milks and oat bars; and squeezable pouches of fruit and vegetable mush. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of these are ultra-processed, meaning they’re made with industrial techniques and additives, and frequently contain high levels of sugar or sodium. One serving (or three tubes) of Yoplait’s Go-Gurt, &lt;a href="https://www.yoplait.com/products/crayola-go-gurt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Crayola Kids&lt;/a&gt; edition, contains 18 grams of added sugar, about 75% of the recommended daily limit for kids ages 2 and up. Gerber’s &lt;a href="https://www.target.com/p/gerber-lil-39-crunchies-mild-cheddar-baked-corn-baby-snacks-1-48oz/-/A-11195277#lnk=sametab" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mild Cheddar Lil’ Crunchies&lt;/a&gt; for babies 8 months and up contains ingredients like maltodextrin and mixed tocopherols — not exactly the kind of stuff grandma could whip up in her kitchen. Taken together with old standbys for the knee-high set, like Goldfish crackers and frozen chicken nuggets, it’s no wonder &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-024-03496-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829780" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; that toddlers in places like Canada and the United Kingdom now get almost half their daily calories from ultra-processed foods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These kinds of foods are designed to appeal both to tots still working on skills like chewing and hand-eye coordination, and to busy working parents in a culture that hardly leaves enough time for a bath and a story before bed — let alone preparing three meals a day plus snacks from scratch. But as everyone from former Food and Drug Administration chief &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/15/ultra-processed-foods-fda-califf-research-diet-related-disease/"&gt;Robert Califf&lt;/a&gt; to new Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/16/rfk-jr-trump-hhs-secretary-health-policy-vaccines-abortion-food-fda-cdc-maha/"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; call for more scrutiny over the potential ties between ultra-processed foods and chronic disease, there’s been surprisingly little focus on how very young children are getting hooked on a way of eating that can have lifelong health consequences. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a very vulnerable stage in the palate development of a child, and people believe this group deserves more protection,” said Fran Fleming, director of marketing initiatives at the University of Connecticut’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health. “It’s tasting real food, and a variety of food, that expands our palate and sets us up for a healthy future. Having ultra-processed foods be the first thing that is a food for children does not set them up for success.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-ultra-processed-food-pipeline-nbsp"&gt;The ‘ultra-processed food pipeline’ &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed food is a broad category, and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/29/ultra-processed-foods-lancet-study-joann-manson-new-dietary-guidelines/"&gt;the products encompassed by the term aren’t necessarily unhealthy&lt;/a&gt;. Infant formula, for example, is an ultra-processed food, but one that provides vital nutrition to babies who need it either as a substitute for, or supplement to, breast milk. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But more broadly, researchers have been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/09/11/ultra-processed-foods-health-nih-research-kevin-hall-controlled-trials/"&gt;raising alarms&lt;/a&gt; about the effects of industrial processes that break down whole foods and modify their ingredients before reconstituting them into alluring new forms, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/19/rfk-jr-maha-call-for-reform-fda-gras-rule-generally-recognized-as-safe/"&gt;unknown long-term impacts of many additives&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that many ultra-processed foods are high in sugar, salt, and saturated fat in order to make them more palatable. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Currently there is no agreed upon scientific definition of ultra-processed foods, and demonizing shelf ready foods could limit access to and cause avoidance of nutritious foods resulting in decreased diet quality, increased risk of food-borne illness and exacerbated health disparities,” Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy at the Consumer Brands Association, said in a statement. “The industry is constantly innovating to meet consumer demand, as seen with the increase of the variety of products that are low in sugar, sodium and saturated fats. Families deserve choices that meet their health and lifestyle needs and parents shouldn’t be made to feel badly for making decisions on what is best for their children.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For babies and toddlers, the added sugars found in many ultra-processed foods are a particular concern. We’re born loving sweets from the get-go: Sugar water dabbed on an infant’s tongue will help soothe the pain of a vaccine jab. But dietary guidelines recommend that children under age 2 avoid added sugar entirely, and that children 2 and up consume no more than 25 grams of added sugar, or about six teaspoons, per day. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Eating a lot of added sugars gives kids a higher sweetness preference, as Michael Moss explains in his 2013 book “Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us,” and encourages them to keep seeking out more sweet foods — which also tend to contain fewer key macronutrients like fiber or protein. “It’s much more addictive for kids when it’s sweeter,” says Barry Popkin, a nutrition professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Food companies know that sugar appeals to young children, and formulate their ingredients accordingly. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10140693/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that sales of sugar via infant and toddler foods grew from 697 billion grams of sugar in 2010 to 1,009 billion grams in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike sugar, salt isn’t naturally alluring to babies; they have to be taught to like it. Nutrition guidelines recommend avoiding added salt as much as possible for babies under 1, over concerns about their developing kidneys. Children between 1 and 3 are supposed to limit their intake to 1,000-1,500 milligrams per day — both because eating a lot of salt is linked with high blood pressure, and because nutrition experts worry they’ll develop a lifelong yen for salty foods, too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522049188?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; found that 84% of packaged toddler meals and 69% of savory snacks for infants and toddlers in the U.S. were high in sodium. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another concern with ultra-processed foods is the processes that allow food companies to develop textures that appeal to young children, like airy puffs and crisp crackers. Breaking down grains, legumes, and other ingredients means that we’re able to digest the food more quickly, which makes us hungrier faster, Popkin explained. If you feed an infant or toddler oatmeal made from just oats and milk or water, “that would fill the kid up for the whole morning,” he said. “But if you feed them the instant stuff, it goes right through them.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some health effects from a diet heavy on ultra-processed foods may become apparent right away. Rapid weight gain in early childhood increases the risk of obesity and associated illnesses, like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, later on. &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/aside&gt;
		


&lt;p&gt;But even if children show no signs of problems to begin with, “you’re increasing the likelihood for those health outcomes later in life, because they’re developing preferences for these kinds of ultra-processed foods that are high in sugar and sodium and saturated fat,” said Lindsey Smith Taillie, a nutrition epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. It wasn’t until she had a child of her own, she said, that she noticed the way babies and toddlers get shuffled into the “ultra-processed food pipeline.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As one illustration of where that pipeline can lead, a lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.forthepeople.com/sites/default/files/2024-12/Filed%20UPF%20Complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;filed late last year&lt;/a&gt; against makers of food behemoths like Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Nestlé, and Coca-Cola is believed to be the first of its kind on the long-term health consequences of consuming ultra-processed foods from childhood. Plaintiff Bryce Martinez was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease at age 16. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit highlights the fact that tobacco behemoths Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds bought food companies like General Foods, Kraft, Nabisco, and Kentucky Fried Chicken in the 1980s. The companies “used their cigarette playbook to fill our food environment with addictive substances that are aggressively marketed to children and minorities,” the lawsuit argues, via tactics like cartoon mascots and advertising that appealed to kids’ desire for play and autonomy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consumer Brands Association’s Sarah Gallo contested the premise of the lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/junk-food-fda-rfk-maha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;saying in a statement to CBS News&lt;/a&gt;: “Attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to think of hyper-palatable, ultra-processed foods in terms of addiction, according to Tera Fazzino, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Infants are highly sensitive to their nutritional environments, and they really are learning from every exposure, every eating occasion what food should taste like,” she said. “If they’re already consuming these hyper-palatable foods regularly, there’s a risk these foods are excessively activating their brain reward neural circuitry, and they may over time develop a really strong drive to consume hyper-palatable foods at the expense of their interest in consuming fresh whole foods like fruits and vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-lure-of-toddler-milk"&gt;The lure of ‘toddler milk’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ask experts who study the issue to name one ultra-processed food they’re concerned about that’s aimed at young children, and toddler milk is usually first on their list. Also known as toddler drink or growing-up milk and aimed at kids between the ages of 1 and 3, the product is a triple whammy: “They’re ultra-processed, they contain added sugar, and there’s no nutritional reason why a toddler would need these types of products,” said Taillie. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the products are shelved alongside baby formula, so it’s easy for harried parents who want to make sure their children are getting their nutritional needs met to assume that a toddler milk from Kendamil, Enfamil, or Similac is the natural next step. And because, unlike baby formula, &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/26436/AAP-clinical-report-Toddler-formulas-offer-no" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;toddler milk isn’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, its packaging often makes claims about providing immune support or boosting brain development. Those claims work: One recent study found that 60% of parents who were surveyed &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32157807/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;believed toddler milks offered nutrients&lt;/a&gt; that couldn’t otherwise be provided in their children’s diets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond toddler milk, trusted brand names that serve relatively healthy baby foods often serve to usher parents toward ultra-processed options in the baby food aisle. If you buy Gerber’s purees when the baby is younger, it’s a short leap to the brand’s cheddar crunchies or strawberry-banana grain bars, which contain 6 grams of added sugar. These snacks are often marketed as part of a young child’s healthy development: The back of the package for &lt;a href="https://www.target.com/p/happybaby-organic-yogis-strawberry-freeze-dried-yogurt-38-fruit-baby-snacks-1oz/-/A-47573409#lnk=sametab" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;HappyBaby’s yogurt-strawberry snacks&lt;/a&gt;, for example, claims that it’s “curated for baby” and “helps develop fine motor skills,” accompanied by an image of a hand grasping the snack between the thumb and index finger. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Of course, babies can just as easily practice their pincer grasps with blueberries or toy blocks. But this kind of messaging works to convince parents that packaged snacks are necessities — a characterization nutrition experts dispute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The idea that we need to be feeding children snacks constantly is not necessarily driven by biology,” said Taillie. “It’s driven by the food industry essentially creating a problem which they solve, like, ‘Oh, your baby you know needs a snack, and also your baby needs this particular type of snack. It needs to be portable, because you have to have it with you all the time. It needs to dissolve in their mouth, because it’s a choking hazard otherwise.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The products’ packaging and marketing, Fleming added, “make the parents think this is even better than any real food.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-the-solution"&gt;What’s the solution?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers say that concerns over the health effects of ultra-processed foods can’t, and shouldn’t, be solved simply by educating parents about nutrition. Rather, they want better policies around the nutritional content, labeling, and marketing of those products. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re all challenged for time,” said Fleming. “But the marketing messages that mislead parents are something that can be changed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parents, she said, are anxious about their children’s nutrition and growth. The marketing of ultra-processed foods for babies and toddlers takes advantage of those anxieties, with packaging that touts added vitamins, whole grains, and no GMOs even as they contain ingredients like high-fructose corn syrup, synthetic dyes, or artificial flavors. “When you talk to parents, they’re not necessarily aware of what the actual ingredients are in the products,” Fleming said, “because they’re marketed as being healthy when they aren’t.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Approaches like adding warning labels about added sugar on fruit drinks could help parents steer away from foods that seem healthy but aren’t, Taillie said. Those kinds of warning labels might also encourage companies to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/15/nutrition-facts-label-fda-front-of-package-backed-by-science-opposed-by-industry/"&gt;reformulate their products&lt;/a&gt; to include less sugar and salt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strengthening the rules around how products aimed at young children are labeled and marketed — for example, by eliminating characters on packaging and restricting health claims — would also go a long way, experts said. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s not possible, or even desirable, to expect parents to avoid ultra-processed foods entirely. “One of the problems is that our societal structure doesn’t support spending a lot of time on preparing home-cooked food,” Taillie said. “We don’t have a lot of paid family leave and universal health care.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And experts agree that warning labels and marketing regulations won’t be enough if healthier foods are unaffordable. One of Taillie’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379724002514" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies looked at the added budget for fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; that the government introduced into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) during the Covid-19 pandemic. She and her co-authors found that when people had more money to put toward produce, they bought more — and more diverse varieties of produce, too, exposing kids to a wider variety of nutrients and expanding their palates. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Purchasing power makes a difference,” said William Masters, a professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition at Tufts University who focuses on food economics. But as House Republicans look to make cuts in federal spending, SNAP and WIC may &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-agriculture/2025/01/13/eyeing-snap-cuts-in-reconciliation-00197735" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;come on the chopping block&lt;/a&gt;. And while Kennedy and Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins have both &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2025/02/19/rfk-jr-snap-program-candy-soda-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; banning candy and other ultra-processed foods from SNAP, nutrition experts are more focused on what can be done to make healthy alternatives accessible. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anything the government can do to make shopping and food prep easier for parents of young children, Masters said, “will pay off in better schooling outcomes, lower health bills, and higher lifelong productivity for those children as they grow.”&lt;/p&gt;

But much of the current research &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25233067/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that there is no clear evidence of harm — and those findings have been emphasized by the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/causes-and-risk-factors"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/antiperspirants-and-breast-cancer-risk.html"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/antiperspirants"&gt;National Kidney Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYBQOW3HL5HPDEPTY64ND2YEE4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because of certain concerns about antiperspirants and kidney disease, however, the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates antiperspirants, requires that they carry &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/omuf/OTC%20Monograph_M019-Antiperspirant%20Drug%20Products%20for%20OTC%20Human%20Use%2011.23.2021.pdf"&gt;a label reading&lt;/a&gt;, “Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ID5L2TP7XBH6TE62SP3JIN2DNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Friedman and other dermatologists said they have noticed a shift among patients toward aluminum-free antiperspirants, many of which claim to be free of parabens and phthalates, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RVI5NONYYZCSBFAOYGWD67M4EQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Deodorants marketed as natural are not as effective as antiperspirants at reducing excessive sweat and may incorporate ingredients such as fragrances and essential oils that may cause irritation or “allergic contact dermatitis, so it is important to be cautious especially if you have sensitive skin,” said &lt;a href="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md"&gt;Marisa Garshick&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and a clinical &lt;a href="https://directory.weill.cornell.edu/person/profile/mak9138"&gt;assistant professor&lt;/a&gt; of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QXQ5JDUOJZDU7O6THOLKKQ622E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another approach involves targeting the odor-causing skin bacteria so there is less of them to break down the sweat. Some people on social media have opted for antibacterial washes containing &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday/video/7365302287595670830?lang=en&amp;amp;q=chlorhexidine%20armpit&amp;amp;t=1740378610036"&gt;benzoyl peroxide or chlorhexidine&lt;/a&gt;, products with glycolic acid or straight &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylimomma/video/7297412946722934059?lang=en&amp;amp;q=alcohol%20armpit&amp;amp;t=1740379242531"&gt;isopropyl alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, all of which “can help with odor, but will not block sweat. They can also be irritating to the skin,” said &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/slipner"&gt;Shari Lipner&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of clinical dermatology at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="CWRKNFOCIZB4HGLX2IPOJAY2ME" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="CWRKNFOCIZB4HGLX2IPOJAY2ME"&gt;What else you should know:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WRGGCFSM25FZFONVQPLHRZJZXY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Choosing a deodorant, antiperspirant or alternative method for underarm odor control is a personal decision, but here are some shopping suggestions from dermatologists:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="W4W2EUQ56BGJNJEAPHJ2YJIXKM" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Determine what type you need.&lt;/b&gt; Deodorants control body odor, and antiperspirants reduce sweating, which then helps to cut down on body odor. Many products include both. “I generally recommend a combined antiperspirant deodorant in a stick format,” Lipner said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decide which formulation works best for you&lt;/b&gt;. Sticks provide controlled application and more complete coverage, as do gels and roll-ons, though the latter two often go on wet and need several seconds to dry. Sprays are quick, easy and absorb well, but Garshick noted that some people do not want “to breathe in the aerosol spray” during the application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider any allergies or sensitivities&lt;/b&gt;. People who have sensitive skin may opt for deodorant products without potential irritants such as alcohol, fragrances or certain preservatives, Friedman said. While he does not consider them effective, aluminum-free options with more plant-based ingredients are available, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WHSNCRRPM5B57DLG234SAY42SM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have concerns, such as  allergies to certain ingredients, speak with a dermatologist about which product or method would work best for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="JTHETOIHXZCZPCVHHMTWVX3UE4" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="JTHETOIHXZCZPCVHHMTWVX3UE4"&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BCOZBPMNCFEDZJPHISOREZWKEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Antiperspirants, in particular, should be applied at bedtime. When applied at night when sweat production is decreased, the aluminum-based compounds in antiperspirants are better able to plug the sweat ducts to reduce perspiration the next day. Deodorants can be applied at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 09:31:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQLURjNzI3Vi1Oc1BWZlpnYjFXaDVHS21adnVTc2Ric2lZdnZIZ2ZmZDRLMlpKQmowV1FRa1VJRGU1Uy1KUkpzc2QtZzZnMUdJTVhRM2o2UGladTVNVXFaeTNKbmwxY2ZZUHBwSU5MSlR3Zzg0UHJtQVF6akctdEo5dXFhaFF4VTZVU1pBVDZRell1bUdRUTFr</guid></item><item><title>Dementia risk could increase with low levels of essential vitamin - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFBkYmlWeXFnZkxfNWtlWTJpSFZPZklVMUVFc24xa1h1NndVaE9RSTIwYWRlRXNtTWtQSm5vaGV6TU5NTDJRNTRIcERqLVR5Y1FPaVpDRjI0a3g0X2VnYUVaS1RZLUY4ZXpwME1KM2xQaXZsVjE0eVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Normal" levels of vitamin B12 may not be enough to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/alzheimers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ward off dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ward off dementia&lt;/a&gt;, new research finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at University of California San Francisco studied 231 healthy older adults (averaging 71 years of age) who did not have dementia or mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests showed that their B12 levels averaged 414.8 pmol/L, while the recommended minimum level in the U.S. is just 148 pmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/drugs-reduce-dementia-risk-others-increase" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Drugs That Reduce Dementia Risk — And Others That Increase It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Drugs That Reduce Dementia Risk — And Others That Increase It&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who had lower B12 levels were found to have "slower cognitive and visual processing speeds" when taking tests, which is linked to "subtle cognitive decline," according to a UCSF press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was more pronounced with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"Normal" levels of vitamin B12 may not be enough to ward off dementia, new research finds.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people with lower levels also had more lesions in the white matter in their brains, which can be a warning sign of cognitive decline, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/stroke" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dementia or stroke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dementia or stroke&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in Annals of Neurology on Feb. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, the researchers recommend updating the current B12 requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dementia-risk-could-lowered-doing-5-minutes-day-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dementia Risk Could Be Lowered By Doing This For 5 Minutes A Day: Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dementia Risk Could Be Lowered By Doing This For 5 Minutes A Day: Study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous studies that defined healthy amounts of B12 may have missed subtle functional manifestations of high or low levels that can affect people without causing overt symptoms," said senior author Ari J.

&lt;p&gt;Eighty-four members of Congress have written to President Trump expressing concerns about his actions regarding the CDC and USDA that will negatively impact the nation’s ability to ensure that bird flu does not become widespread among people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;United States Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-CT, leads the 83 other lawmakers in the effort to change the president’s mind about measures he has taken that they believe will hamper the U.S. Department of Agruculture’s and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s efforts in containing bird flu, also known as H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus has already infected 70 people and killed one. More than 970 dairy herds in the United States have been infected and the virus has resulted in the culling of more than 157 million commercial poultry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since becoming president, Trump has restricted communication between the CDC and the USDA, making it impossible for the agencies to collaborate on the nation’s response to bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The most effective way to cut through agency bureaucracy, which you claim to be in favor of, would be to increase agency communication with Congress, stakeholders, and the public,” the lawmakers’ letter states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus has already mutated, with a second strain infecting a dairy herd in Nevada. So far, human H5N1 infections have largely led to mild illnesses, according to the lawmakers, however the two cases of severe illness in North America were associated with this new variant, including a Louisiana resident who died, and a British Columbia teen who was in critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Failure to restore full interagency information sharing and public health communications continues to harm the U.S. Response to H5N1,” according to the members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement about the lawmakers’ letter to the president, DeLauro said the gag order has harmed the response to prevent the spread of H5N1, and the government must be allowed to resume interagency communications and the sharing of critical public health information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Your Administration must act quickly to address this crisis,” the lawmakers wrote. “Viruses will not wait for this Administration to lift its gag order or for agencies to restart their collaboration and information sharing before they spread or mutate. It is clear that these interfering short-sighted actions by your Administration will cause significant harm. This interference must end.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know you would not like to see another deadly pandemic unfold under your watch. [T]hus, we await your swift action to completely lift the pause on external communications by public health agencies, commit to cross-agency collaboration on H5N1, and work to get every necessary state enrolled in the National Milk Testing Strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, the USDA confirmed that it fired several agency employees working on the federal response to H5N1. The Administration “prioritizing” their bird flu response and firing of federal employees actively working on this worsening outbreak cannot both coexist, according to the lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The members of Congress also asked President Trump to encourage all states to engage in the National Milk Testing Strategy (NMTS) to facilitate comprehensive H5N1 detection in the nation’s milk supply. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to sending their letter to President Trump, the lawmakers copied Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins. &lt;/p&gt;

She watched patients die alone and missed her son's birthday out of fear of becoming infected and bringing the virus home with her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2021, Covid vaccines became available and, feeling a sense of duty to protect her patients, she took the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-cdcb3010-f3aa-11ef-8125-0bb3f6a87bc2"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She experienced no immediate side effects, but in July 2021, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14418267/Vaccine-victims-left-disabled-taking-Covid-jab-react-bombshell-Yale-study-shots-cause-extreme-body-changes.html"&gt;Mrs Burnette developed 'unbearable' pain&lt;/a&gt; in both of her hips. She was told she had arthritis at 31 years old and had to use a wheelchair when the pain made it too hard to walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Believing her pain was something else, another doctor ordered an MRI, which revealed Mrs Burnette's hip bones were literally rotting, and she underwent her first hip replacement in December 2021. The second followed a few months later in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, her hips were just the beginning. Over the next nearly four years - and still ongoing today - Mrs Burnette would undergo surgeries on both shoulders and knees, three surgeries on her elbow, one on her left foot and she is scheduled to have another procedure on her right foot next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a year after her ordeal began, one of her doctors attributed her complications to her bout of Covid in late November 2020 and subsequent vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brittany Burnette lives in Tennessee with her husband and two sons (pictured here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette told DailyMail.com: 'The pain is so debilitating. I have never felt so helpless in my entire life. I've always been trying to be the best provider I could be caring for other people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, due to Mrs Burnette's condition, she had to quit her job as a nurse and director in an elder care home and go on disability.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued: 'Now I can't even drive my kids to school in the morning anymore... it's devastating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have really had to mourn the life that I thought I was going to have because I will no longer be able to be the same person I've always wanted to be because of a virus and a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette, now 34, used to be a nurse and director in a nursing home but has had to go on disability because of her medical complications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's absolutely destroyed my life, and so I've had to just totally sit back and reevaluate everything.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like thousands of Americans who suffered injuries shortly after getting their Covid vaccine, Mrs Burnette attributes her ailments to the shot. But a lack of research and evidence has left vaccine victims without answers, lacking support and being cast as anti-vaxxers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, last week, a small Yale University study offered some support to victims' stories as experts discovered a previously-unknown condition - dubbed 'post-vaccination syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus and exercise intolerance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition also appears to reawaken a dormant virus in the body called Epstein-Barr, which can cause flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes and nerve issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Burnette's symptoms don't match all of those mentioned in the research - she has experienced nerve complications - the researchers said vaccine injuries can manifest differently from patient to patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette told DailyMail.com she remains a supporter of vaccines and she and her children have all received routine shots, but she is hesitant to get new ones going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the hardest things about her complications is the impact it has on her as a mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette's pain is so severe she is often reliant on a wheelchair to get around&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'I worry every day that I'm going to cause [my sons] to have stress and anxiety when they're older but they have made me feel so strong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel like, if anything, this just made them so much more compassionate. They are always always there no matter what, at my back to take care of me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My 10 year old has really stepped up and my husband, he works very hard for us, especially with me losing [my job]. He's really been an amazing caretaker and taken over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just don't know if I would have made it. They are the reason I keep going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to her vaccine, Mrs Burnette had been living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - thickening of the heart muscle - but her condition was well managed under the care of a cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her new symptoms began, she has seen doctors across multiple specialties, including orthopedics and a geneticist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website her geneticist attributes her complications to a combination of her Covid infection and the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor, Mrs Burnette said, told her when she received the vaccine it prompted an immune response and her body sent out thousands of clots that cut off the blood supply to her bones and joints and cause them to collapse and die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of Mrs Burnette's other doctors believe she has the autoimmune diseases either lupus or rheumatoid arthritis but diagnostic tests have come back negative or inconclusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette has undergone three surgeries on her elbow to remove dead bone and repair a nerve (left) and has had both of her knees replaced (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has been diagnosed with multifocal avascular necrosis (AVN), also called multifocal osteonecrosis (MFON). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AVN is a condition in which bones throughout the body lose their blood supply, causing them to die. It can be caused by trauma to the body, like broken or fractured bones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2023/09000/avascular_necrosis_of_femoral_head_following.5.aspx"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;in the journal Annals of Medicine and Surgery investigated the relationship of avascular necrosis (AVN) and Covid infection in 17 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found 82 percent of patients complained of pain in both hips, leading nearly 18 percent to undergo total hip replacements and they concluded 'there is a risk of developing AVN after Covid-19.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no published research on the connection between AVN and Covid vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brandson Crawford, a functional neurologist who is not involved in Mrs Burnette's care, told DailyMail.com AVN can be triggered by inflammation and blood clotting abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These, Dr Crawford said, have been documented both in severe Covid cases and post-vaccination adverse reactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'Given that Covid-19 is known to affect the vascular system and trigger inflammatory responses, it is plausible that a vaccine administered soon after an infection could further exacerbate these effects, particularly in individuals with underlying predispositions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette is pictured above receiving her Covid vaccine in January 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her hip replacements, Mrs Burnette has also undergone a partial left shoulder replacement in September 2022 and had three surgeries on her elbow to remove dead bone and repair a nerve in January 2023, August 2024 and November 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She underwent a right knee replacement in August 2023, a partial right shoulder replacement in May 2023, a left knee replacement in February 2023 and in July 2023 her left heel broke and had to be surgically repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette will undergo surgery in the next few weeks to repair another fracture in her right foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'Even though I have had all of these replacements and surgeries I am still in constant deep bone pain every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It isn't as bad as bone death pain but some days are still unbearable. The pain is so bad some days it takes everything I have to get out of bed and move, let alone be a mother and wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Doctors] think I will likely suffer with bone pain for the rest of my life.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not only has she had to cope with AVN, her doctors said the infection and vaccine triggered a 'domino effect' in her body, leading to blood clots in her lungs, declining kidney function, sepsis and pleurisy - inflammation of the lining in the lungs and chest cavity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above is an x-ray showing Mrs Burnette's double hip replacements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In an alternative effort to treat her ailments, doctors have prescribed chemotherapy and immunotherapy infusions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I'm not going to tell you I haven't had dark, scary days and struggle, because I have... without my family and God, I just don't know. That's just what kept me going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Burnette believes in vaccines, when she first started speaking out about her experience with the Covid shot, she said she was met with people questioning whether she was an anti-vaxxer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Mrs Burnette has always been pro-vaccine and she and her children received all the recommended shots. Now, however, she is extremely wary of new ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website she will never get or give her children another Covid vaccine, but has no problem getting them routine vaccinations of shots that have been around and researched for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette said: 'I did everything that I needed to do, vaccinating my children. I was vaccinated, but, I will never get another flu shot or COVID vaccine, and I won't give my kids either as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They will get... the other ones that have been well studied and researched, and there's lots of information on over the years. I just think that newer vaccines, before mandated, need to be researched because these are people's lives that it's destroying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 03:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPUlV0ZUFzQzJmaEpZd0MybVdUSURmSXM2WTBHNDRSZnVBaENTbmdKbkd6Wkh0cU5ESnVYOXdhZThpLVEtTll5MFpTMXNqZ3luT2tKSlM2N0FNZ3ZLSUxiVmVZMjg0RnQ5WWNpOGFzWmJGYndWUHJ5UFdmbmZiODVEeG13Vmp1cHpobUo4MkhDb1VBVThoMjViclZxX3g4TmdJaG9xRW14WFk5M3ROZXfSAbMBQVVfeXFMUE52X1BRTDdUSGpFZ3JMbGNDVnlhSTZ4NHNPMWlDc2lDVGdSUV9MUy1EMmc1bmFMN3lvMGVNMVJUV3p2dWJ1UFFPb0NYT3pkTG1fYmYyazdha01IejB6M0RDMGoxbEZuQnNnZnc0ZFdDNko0QUR0VHNDV2xwMnAzQzJzblFYS2taSmlFYlV5ejBuZXd5SDVFMVVjRC13WXNIUnA4RkhuTWNJWDRkMWZCNWN2NlU</guid></item><item><title>Over 50 deaths linked to 'unknown disease' in Congo - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNYWE0MTE3eHpyOG8ybGtNYVNkb1R3ZnpDT0ZQWEdSbEhfY24tMkE4UDFnVmI3U3AwNDdLNlNTOEJqVzJ3cUtMNmFwNW8tVGNnbFRnNkgtWDVmdVJRd05IeG5HbThHbUJNeTVldWxXZWdDVGhJVXlZX2JpMk52ZFFncW5JWGV6Tkw0dnZF0gGQAUFVX3lxTE1TM2VsTm5fV2FMLUVFRmVCQ1pNQm1icU9uYVptSDZrNXVKSGRPVmNQNkRzS3drZEVBbWxrSEZLaF9GZXE5Q21CcVZRZW1FV3ZPbmNBNnA3RHJYMW1QelAxcW5xMkFJT3pvSmNJTFVRREdnVTlkTXp0S0NQek9KZUV2RnJpWVMxMGM0N0s2T3Jpag?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The World Health Organization has reported that there is a deadly "unknown disease" spreading in one region within the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Local health officials in Congo are partnering with the World Health Organization to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A general view of the World Health Organization (WHO) on April 28, 2009, in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Harold Cunningham/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The phrase "unknown disease" primarily means that the disease has not yet been identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In previous cases, the cases are linked to a known disease, but a lack of available testing leads to lack of certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For example, there was a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/undiagnosed-disease-congo-linked-malaria-africa-cdc/story?id=116939557" target="_blank"&gt;separate report&lt;/a&gt;
