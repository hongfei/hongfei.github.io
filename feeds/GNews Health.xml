It also nourishes body tissues and accelerates cell regeneration. It is also a rich source of vitamin C, which helps build the immune system and provides resistance against many diseases, especially those of the respiratory tract.  It is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9137578/"&gt;proven&lt;/a&gt; that amla's rich antioxidant profile, including gallic acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and phenolic compounds, help modulate immune function by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.  Regular consumption of amla is said to help reduce bad cholesterol (LDL), manage blood pressure, and improve overall cardiovascular function. It can also help boost collagen production, slow down signs of aging, and promote healthy, glowing skin. Its high fiber content aids in digestion and detoxification, while its anti-inflammatory properties support heart and liver health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 04:15:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州150多名未接种疫苗的学生在麻疹暴露后进行隔离- ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/US/150-unvaccinated-students-south-carolina-quarantining-after-measles/story?id=126459506</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineVideo FeaturedVideo" aria-label="Video"&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU eEzcu lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Boxes and vials of the Measles, Mumps, Rubella Virus Vaccine at a vaccine clinic put on by Lubbock Public Health Department, March 1, 2025, in Lubbock, Texas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 01:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQNndxZGsxYTRCaVlSQ1lmRGZIZ3ZiNjJLWGxwUllENUdWQi0ySE0weGViMk9fajVYNWlORlNWWE9YSTBvR1lPY2p4WU5LbDMzdmE1VXpSVEZLNUt6SWtKZTFFVFVHdF9EV2VHcGpDQmp3ZVpDd0luU1dRQkNRVWNLNDRwbUw0TlRWU3ppaWFWUlJmb3ptWXF3d1JLcGRDYUhJM25qcGtMbk0tYndPdTJsVjJB0gG3AUFVX3lxTFAweERMVkJDVXM0eHI4TmhkWWlONGJ0Y3dMeWN3TDlmNmJ3M3NYelRlamwtZTZzTWtoUlk3bk4zTlpXX2hkaGJlTU91N05Ndy1RMGtHYnd3dXBZTU9QTW9IZWR0eDRsZ3Y3WDg2OU02NGRhdTZkRVpHaHl1b0Z4ZWdlTGx3WloyZ0h2S0F1OF82ak1Ec0J3YXZ6dDNZc2FJSERqWkJYWnEteUhsQlRNWm1OcGhMNW5Xcw</guid></item><item><title>美国麻疹病例继续攀升，全国各地爆发- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/10/12/nx-s1-5572507/us-measles-outbreaks-texas-south-carolina-utah-minnesota</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Nearly two months after a deadly, massive measles outbreak in Texas was &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;declared over,&lt;/a&gt; the highly contagious disease continues to spread across the country. The U.S. has now confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,563 cases&lt;/a&gt; this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the highest annual number &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health" target="_blank"&gt;in more than three decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the true total could be even higher, says &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you talk to people on the ground, including not only in Texas, but other states, they all say the same thing, which is that the numbers are much worse than that. Probably closer to 5,000 cases," Offit says. "And it's not done."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He points to the current outbreak in South Carolina, where more than 150 unvaccinated schoolchildren at two schools are now subject to a 21-day quarantine after being exposed to measles. The state Department of Public Health this past week &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/dph-confirms-states-11th-measles-case-greenville-county-eighth-related-current-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;reported the eighth confirmed measles&lt;/a&gt; case since Sept. 25. Public health officials say it's not clear if that new case, in Greenville County, is linked to seven cases that are part of a current outbreak in neighboring Spartanburg County, S.C.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"What this new case tells us is that there is active, unrecognized community transmission of measles occurring," &lt;a href="https://studysc.org/sc-people/linda-bell" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Linda Bell&lt;/a&gt;, South Carolina's state epidemiologist, told reporters during a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baOoDM-Bn2g" target="_blank"&gt;briefing&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. She said that makes it vital that the public receive the recommended measles vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a large measles outbreak along the border areas of Arizona and southwestern Utah continues to grow, with Utah now &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;reporting 55 cases&lt;/a&gt; this year as of Friday. Nearly all of the cases occurred in people who were unvaccinated. Six people required hospitalization. According to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, wastewater testing shows that the measles virus is more widespread in the state than previously known. In neighboring Arizona, officials have reported &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;63 cases&lt;/a&gt; so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And in Minnesota, officials last week reported that a small, recent surge in measles cases there has brought the state's &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/measles/stats.html" target="_blank"&gt;total for the year to 20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All told, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; 44 measles outbreaks in 41 states this year. The agency defines an outbreak as three or more cases that are linked.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The vast majority of cases were in people who were unvaccinated; 27% percent have been in children under the age of 5. About 1 in 8 measles cases have resulted in hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Widespread vaccination in the U.S. has saved hundreds of lives each year&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt; known to humans. On average, an infected person will infect as many as 18 other unvaccinated people. A person with measles can emit infectious particles that linger in the air for up to two hours, long after they've left a room. That's why it's so highly transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before widespread vaccination, pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And 400-500 people in the U.S. used to die from it each year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. To protect communities against outbreaks, they need a vaccination rate of 95%, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nationwide, measles vaccination rates have been slipping for years — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;they're currently at 92.5%&lt;/a&gt;. The trend predates the current administration, but Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City, says it doesn't help that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a long history of criticizing vaccines. Ratner notes that acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill has suggested breaking up the standard measles, mumps and rubella vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation" target="_blank"&gt;into three separate shots&lt;/a&gt;, which Ratner says is neither feasible nor is it backed by data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's no wonder that parents are, you know, confused and frightened," says Ratner, the author of &lt;em&gt;Booster Shots&lt;/em&gt;, a history of the fight against measles and its recent resurgence.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In some communities, kindergarten vaccination rates are much lower than the national average. That's created pockets of opportunity for measles to spread, Ratner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If a measles case comes into a place with a low vaccination rate, it can really take off," Ratner says. "That's what we saw in Gaines County" — the epicenter of the Texas outbreak that saw &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;762 cases and two deaths&lt;/a&gt; — "and that's what we're seeing in lots of places."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Any radio amateur will tell you about the spectre of TVI, of their transmissions being inadvertently demodulated by the smallest of non-linearity in the neighbouring antenna systems, and spewing forth from the speakers of all and sundry. It’s very much a thing that the most unlikely of circuits can function as radio receivers, but… teeth? [Ringway Manchester] &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0zrGnlrm-s" target="_blank"&gt;investigates tales of musical dental work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through a series of news reports over the decades, including one of Lucille Ball uncovering a hidden Japanese spy transmitter, it’s something all experts who have looked at the issue have concluded there is little evidence for. It was also investigated by Mythbusters. But it’s an alluring tale, so is it entirely fabricated? What we can say is that teeth are sensitive to sound, not in themselves, but because the jaw provides a good path bringing vibrations to the region of the ear. And it’s certainly possible that the active chemical environment surrounding a metal filling in a patient’s mouth could give rise to electrical non-linearities. But could a human body in an ordinary RF environment act as a good enough antenna to provide enough energy for something to happen? We have our doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a perennial story (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBla6TAH7o" target="_blank"&gt;even in fiction&lt;/a&gt;), though, and we’re guessing that proof will come over the coming decades. If the tales of dental music and DJs continue after AM (or Long Wave in Europe) transmissions &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/06/07/am-the-original-speech-transmission-mode/"&gt;have been turned off&lt;/a&gt;, then it’s likely they’re more in the mind than in the mouth. If not, then we might have missed a radio phenomenon. The video is below the break.&lt;/p&gt;

Ischemic stroke, which makes up about 87 percent of all strokes, results from a clot that blocks a blood vessel supplying the brain, starving brain cells of oxygen and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hemorrhagic Stroke accounts for the other 13 percent of strokes, occurring when a weakened blood vessel ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain. The leading culprit for both types is high blood pressure, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13992723/Half-Americans-silent-killer-condition-CDC-warns.html"&gt;the 'silent killer&lt;/a&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While strokes can seem to appear suddenly, many of the risks that lead to them are built by the decisions people make every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-2c6fec40-a612-11f0-b94b-535ba609e711"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; General Hospital, told the Daily Mail: ‘[Younger people seeing rising rates of stroke] is because people are overall, especially with the western diet, sedentary lifestyle and some of the diseases that we know plague our society, unfortunately getting sicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We also know that access to health care is difficult, especially for the population that's working in the gig economy, because they don't get health insurance from employers. So what that means is, if something's wrong with them, usually starting in their 30s, 40s, 50s, they pay for it in their 60s and 70s.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That extended time at one’s desk, the convenience of processed meals and putting off preventive care are active contributors to stroke risk. But by making targeted, manageable adjustments to these common areas, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14563743/Siobhan-Mclernon-nurse-five-habits-brain-stroke.html"&gt;people can actively shield&lt;/a&gt; their health and dramatically improve their long-term outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A sedentary desk life, a processed food diet, and skipped doctors appointments are active drivers of stroke risk (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Incidence of stroke had been on a steady decline among over-50s since the 1990s before plateauing and then rising in recent years, according to American Heart Association data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite a 20 to 30 percent drop in individual risk for older adults since 1990, the total number of strokes in this group has risen sharply due to an ever-growing senior population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Younger adults, meanwhile, are seeing a grim rise. While stroke incidence has fallen for those over 50, it is moving in the opposite direction for adults aged 15 to 49, particularly in specific states across the South and Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The alarming shift suggests that modern risk factors, such as rising rates of obesity, hypertension and diabetes in younger populations, are now outpacing the medical advances that have protected older generations, signaling a new and urgent public health challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prolonged sitting disrupts the metabolism, raising blood sugar and triglycerides (fat in the blood) while lowering good cholesterol, damaging blood vessels and promoting the accumulation of artery-clogging plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, stagnant blood flow in the legs increases the risk of clots, which can travel to the brain and cause a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dua said: ‘Our jobs are pretty sedentary, and that leads to other problems, like diabetes, high blood pressure, of course, and smoking; and while it is overall decreasing, is still very, very prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And these three risk factors, the diabetes, the smoking and the high blood pressure, specifically the high blood pressure, are the primary causes of damage to the inside lining of blood vessels.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Dr Anahita Dua, a prominent vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, told the Daily Mail that sedentary jobs contribute directly to major health issues like diabetes and high blood pressure, noting that smoking also remains a widespread problem. These factors are primary culprits that damage the inner lining of blood vessels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A diet heavy in processed and fast foods launches continuous assaults on the cardiovascular system, primarily through a massive sodium load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dua said: ‘Certain processed foods that are high, not only in sodium, which causes high blood pressure, but also saturated fat, for example, bacon, really have a serious impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Now, anything in moderation is fine, but obviously, if you couple that with a genetic predisposition to having these diseases, you have a problem, right?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess salt raises blood pressure by increasing blood volume, which over time damages arteries and makes them prone to rupture or clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Salty, processed foods are often loaded with unhealthy saturated and trans fats, which contribute to the buildup of atherosclerotic plaque. This narrows the arteries and forces the heart to work even harder, further elevating blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The combination of hardened, narrowed arteries and chronically high pressure creates a prime environment for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Ignoring hypertension (high blood pressure) allows it to damage the arteries, compounding the damage exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dua said: ‘[Young people] who are not necessarily in a steady, run-of-the-mill job that's 40 hours a week that's giving them health insurance, couple that with the money that they probably make on and off on in the gig economy… that's not somebody that's going to be buying fresh fruits and vegetables and preparing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So what are they eating? They're eating the hardcore processed meals, high in all these things, the sodium, the fat … and unfortunately, that translates to high blood pressure.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking is another daily habit that, over time, drastically increases one’s risk of suffering a stroke. Neurologists reported in 2011 that current smokers have at least a two- to four-fold increased risk of stroke compared with lifelong nonsmokers or individuals who had quit smoking more than 10 years prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;From 2001 until the early 2010s, stroke death rates fell significantly across all US regions. But this graph shows that progress has stalled and reversed. After 2020, stroke death rates began to rise again in every region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemicals in tobacco smoke directly impact the cardiovascular system by damaging vessel walls, thickening the blood and speeding up plaque accumulation, creating a triple threat for triggering a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Consistently sleeping fewer than six hours also significantly increases stroke risk. One major study of 90,000 older women found that short sleepers had a 22 percent higher risk of ischemic stroke, a link that was strongest in those who were otherwise healthy, indicating poor sleep is an independent risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This pattern held across demographics, with other large studies confirming that short sleep can more than double stroke risk in both men and women of various ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Sleep is directly associated with regeneration of your body,’ Dr Dua said. ‘In these people that have injury to the blood vessel for whatever the reason may be, if they're not getting appropriate sleep, they're not able to regenerate and heal whatever injury they initially sustained. That translates to continuing the process that ultimately leads to stroke.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Skipping routine health screenings is another dangerous gamble with one’s long-term health, Dr Dua added. Regular check-ups are the most crucial line of defense and act as an early warning system for silent but deadly conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time symptoms finally appear, the underlying disease may already be in an advanced stage. Early detection allows for timely intervention through lifestyle changes or medication, which can stop the progression of vascular disease and dramatically reduce the risk of a future heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Going on antidepressants can give many people their life back, but for some there is a catch.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;About &lt;a href="https://rxisk.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSM-PSSD.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;25%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-025-06751-1" target="_blank"&gt; to 80%&lt;/a&gt; of people who take antidepressants experience sexual side effects to some degree during treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgnopckt00023b6ntkodh8k9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, a tool may one day help patients both feel better and keep their sex life intact, early research suggests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0be00063b6n38f1kri8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though cases of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction have been&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0141076819899299#bibr3-0141076819899299" target="_blank"&gt;documented since 1960&lt;/a&gt;, there has never been a way to predict the odds of problems with libido, arousal, orgasm, erectile function or other sexual functions before someone starts taking an antidepressant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf00073b6n61jpy94j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That uncertainty eventually may change with the new use of a brain test that indirectly measures levels of the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24795-ssri" target="_blank"&gt;critical neurotransmitter serotonin&lt;/a&gt; — which is involved in libido, arousal, mood, appetite, sleep, memory and social behavior.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgnoq70s00043b6nq8rak8jt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The novel application of the existing test is described in preliminary, first-of-its-kind research to be presented Tuesday at the 38th ECNP (European College of Neuropsychopharmacology) Congress in Amsterdam. The research is currently an abstract, so it’s still under peer review before it will be published in a journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf00083b6n2rhy7s01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the findings are replicated in studies with more participants, they “could enable a more precise approach to depression treatment,” lead researcher Dr. Kristian Jensen said in a news release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf00093b6nj720jc2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Such testing could help doctors select medications to minimize risk of sexual side effects in patients most likely to experience them, said Jensen, a physician and postdoctoral researcher at the neurobiological research unit of Copenhagen University Hospital and Mental Health Services Centre Copenhagen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000a3b6nyhozj78h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The noninvasive test is an electroencephalogram, or EEG, which involves &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875" target="_blank"&gt;placing small electrodes&lt;/a&gt; on the scalp to record electrical activity in the brain.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000b3b6n2wv3et8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The test captures a specific biomarker called Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potentials, or LDAEP, which measures the brain’s electrical activity in response to sound. Auditory perception is dependent upon the brain’s serotonin levels since the neurotransmitter regulates the processing of sensory information including sound, Jensen told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000c3b6npqprgllv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The lower the LDAEP level, the greater the serotonin activity.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;After serotonin does its job in the brain, nerve cells reabsorb it. The common antidepressant escitalopram and others that are selective serotonin reuptake-inhibitors, or SSRIs, work by limiting the brain’s reuptake, making more serotonin available for use in regulating mood. Though this increase can be beneficial for mood, it’s also one of the mechanisms thought to cause antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000d3b6ncrflght2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Previous studies have suggested the LDAEP marker may be worth investigating in people with mental health conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety, in that LDAEP levels may help predict how well a patient will respond to different psychiatric medications.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000e3b6nr6mh8w6w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers behind the latest science studied 90 participants with major depressive disorder and found lower LDAEP measures (which means higher serotonin levels) predicted orgasmic dysfunction from eight weeks of treatment with escitalopram with 87% accuracy.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000f3b6n36b7k7bt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jensen and others are currently working on a similar study with 600 participants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000g3b6n1g9ijy21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measure didn’t significantly predict reduced libido but was slightly associated with the severity of antidepressant-related decreased libido. And regardless of what participants’ LDAEP measures were, they didn’t translate to differences in baseline sexual function before antidepressant treatment, further suggesting the medication caused the sexual dysfunction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000h3b6nt43b73ws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The precise treatment approach Jensen and his colleagues described “could help treatment adherence and overall quality of life and generally give better treatment options for depression,” he added. “We need a bigger study, with more men, to get an accurate figure for erectile dysfunction.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000i3b6nftjtvhut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The participants were unmedicated prior to treatment, age 27 on average and mostly female. To measure LDAEP, the researchers played “sounds at different volumes through headphones while measuring brain waves,” Jensen said in the news release. “It takes about 30 minutes and is non-invasive. It’s not generally available at the moment, but that may change if this test lives up to expectations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000j3b6nj7sd6spx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though early, the research is promising and could be quite useful, said Dr. Josef Witt-Doerring, a psychiatrist and CEO and medical director of TaperClinic, who wasn’t involved in the study. He and other clinicians help patients experiencing complex withdrawal syndromes and tapering off psychiatric drugs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000k3b6n5qwe51fg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, “there are clear caveats,” said psychiatrist Dr. Sameer Jauhar, a clinical associate professor in affective disorders and psychosis at Imperial College London, in a written statement provided by the Science Media Centre. Jauhar wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000l3b6n2t0v7pmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The LDAEP measure “is not a direct measure of serotonin activity,” Jauhar said. “It is not measuring it in the way we generally measure neurotransmitters in the brain, i.e. through molecular imaging, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7385290/" target="_blank"&gt;such as PET&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000m3b6ncgm0cqjl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But PET scans are invasive, costly and time-consuming, Jensen told CNN. “Nonetheless, our research unit has used PET to demonstrate that LDAEP is associated with serotonin levels,” he added. “The relationship between LDAEP and serotonin goes back several decades of human and animal research. It’s rare to find a biomarker that is both scientifically robust and practically accessible.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000n3b6n5revea4q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the predictive accuracy requires clarification in a peer-reviewed publication, Jauhar added. “Sometimes smaller sample sizes can inflate this, and it needs validation in another dataset.” A placebo-controlled study would also be ideal, both Jauhar and Jensen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmgn7e0tq00133b6n99mw2og0@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="antidepressants-and-sexual-function" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Antidepressants and sexual function
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000o3b6nky08j2wb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db528.htm" target="_blank"&gt;11.4% of adults&lt;/a&gt; in the United States took antidepressants in 2023 for depression alone. Millions more take them for other mental health issues including anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, some eating disorders, substance use disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Information on global estimates of antidepressant use is lacking.)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000p3b6nx3p507bj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The science behind antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction boils down to neurotransmitters, blood flow and the muscular system, all of which are controlled by the brain, experts told CNN &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/health/antidepressants-sexual-side-effects-tips-wellness"&gt;in a 2024 report&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000q3b6ns77rfzzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s necessary for physical arousal and orgasm is increased blood flow to the genitalia, which makes nerve endings in these organs more sensitive, Dr. Lauren Streicher, founding medical director of the Northwestern Medicine Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause, told CNN in 2024. These factors send signals to the brain that result in the muscle contractions accompanied by orgasm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000r3b6nnjcmnsbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Higher levels of serotonin in the brain and other areas involved in sex can inhibit those functions, said Streicher — since SSRIs potentially restrict blood flow by binding to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, which are found in blood vessels in the skin, brain and more. The receptors control constriction and dilation in the smooth muscle fibers in the walls of these blood vessels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000s3b6nlfdw5504@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since not everyone taking these medications experiences sexual dysfunction even with higher levels of serotonin in the body, there may be underlying factors — such as genetics — making some people more prone to being negatively affected, Streicher said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000t3b6nwh7jzcrm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of the large percentage of antidepressant takers who experience sexual side effects, there is a small percentage for whom those effects persist, or begin upon quitting the drug, for several years to decades after treatment — a condition known as post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, or PSSD. Despite its name, the condition, which has yet to be formally recognized, is often also paired with emotional, cognitive and physical dysfunction.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000u3b6n3lu17x1v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t really know what this (research) means in terms of predicting people who will develop PSSD,” Witt-Doerring said, but “it makes sense that it could decrease the chance that someone gets PSSD.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000v3b6n2jyrxt6v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The historical inability to predict antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction isn’t the result of dashed efforts, but of a general lack of scientific inquiry, Witt-Doerring said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000w3b6nplxiqvs5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was just surprised to see that someone was even looking at that,” he added. “There’s obviously a really good public health incentive to do it, but that’s not always what really motivates people.” &lt;s&gt; &lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000x3b6nu9o0muex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings of the latest research “should encourage people to study this important side effect in more detail,” Jauhar said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000y3b6nq3a54yfv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the prevalence of antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction and patients who &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35918097/" target="_blank"&gt;don’t respond well&lt;/a&gt; or at all to antidepressants, the latest science adds to a body of research that may advance the development of methods for predicting both effectiveness and harms of different drugs for the individual, Witt-Doerring said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000z3b6na8ypgobk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To avoid antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction, many people opt for or switch to bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, or NDRI, Dr. Jonathan Alpert, the Dorothy and Marty Silverman Chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/health/antidepressants-sexual-side-effects-tips-wellness"&gt;told CNN in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of increasing serotonin, bupropion ups the amount of ﻿the neurotransmitter&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dopamine, which supports sexual desire and response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf00103b6n0g5mpl4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re already on an antidepressant causing sexual problems, work with your prescribing clinician to troubleshoot the issue and avoid potentially exacerbating it, Streicher said. They might wait and see if your body adjusts within a few months, but many people switch medications if they don’t want to wait or if side effects don’t alleviate, Alpert said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf00113b6nx0ld66re@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other times, to better manage or alleviate dysfunction, doctors may add another medication to a patient’s current routine. Medications for general sexual dysfunction, such as sildenafil or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, are sometimes prescribed to promote better blood flow and muscle relaxation in genital areas, counteracting the blood vessel constriction caused by high levels of serotonin, experts said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;A new UC Irvine study may have finally uncovered how dietary fiber protects the body from sugar’s damage, and how protecting yourself starts in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Researchers at the UCI School of Medicine found that inulin, a naturally occurring fiber found in vegetables like onions, garlic and artichokes, can reshape the bacteria living in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;your gut&lt;/a&gt; to stop fructose before it hits your liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that consuming a type of dietary fiber called inulin… changes the bacteria in the gut to promote the consumption of harmful dietary fructose," said lead researcher Cholsoon Jang, PhD, of UCI’s Nutrient Metabolism &amp;amp; Disease Lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in Nature Metabolism, reveal a new level of protection &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;offered by fiber,&lt;/a&gt; not just in digestion, but in how the body handles sugar at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/actress-kristen-bells-easy-diet-trick-help-stabilize-blood-sugar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACTRESS KRISTEN BELL’S EASY DIET TRICK TO HELP STABILIZE BLOOD SUGAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists say fiber could help prevent or reverse early signs of fatty liver disease.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jang and his team discovered that when people eat fructose (a common sugar in fruit and sweetened foods) gut bacteria in the small intestine can metabolize it before it reaches the liver. But without enough fiber, too much fructose "spills over," overwhelming the liver and triggering fat buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/risk-colon-cancer-slashed-eating-specific-types-vegetables-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RISK OF COLON CANCER SLASHED BY EATING SPECIFIC TYPES OF VEGETABLES, STUDY FINDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fructose is a sugar found in fruit that can 'spill' into the liver, leading to liver disease.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By feeding &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/bacteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; with inulin, researchers found that the microbes essentially burn through fructose early, preventing that cascade of damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more striking, once these bacteria were "primed" by inulin, they were able to reverse signs of fatty liver disease, reducing fat accumulation and boosting the liver’s natural antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/experts-reveal-5-step-approach-healthier-gut-stronger-immunity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERTS REVEAL 5-STEP APPROACH TO A HEALTHIER GUT AND STRONGER IMMUNITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jang says the research proves not all calories are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says their work gives "insight into how fiber protects our health from harmful nutrients like fructose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Nature Metabolism study identified how specific gut bacteria metabolize sugar before it reaches the liver.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on non-obese participants: people who might otherwise slip under the radar yet still face hidden risks from high-sugar diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jang noted that metabolic damage isn’t limited to those who are overweight. Even people who appear healthy can experience liver stress and insulin resistance if their gut microbes aren’t equipped to handle excess fructose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By identifying specific gut bacteria and metabolic pathways involved, our findings can guide personalized nutrition strategies," Jang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vegetables like garlic, artichokes and onions can be a good source of inulin, the helpful fiber studied by the research team.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that future research will explore whether other common fibers beyond inulin can trigger similar protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MORE IN HEALTH NEWS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications stretch far beyond the lab. If certain fibers can train gut microbes to neutralize sugar before it harms the liver, it could open the door to new treatments for fatty liver disease, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;diabetes,&lt;/a&gt; obesity and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, researchers explain that the findings indicate that fiber not only aids digestion but can be a defender of metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Jang put it: "For example, by checking how well someone’s gut bacteria clears fructose before the body absorbs it, we can choose the right prebiotic or probiotic supplement for that person to improve results and reduce side effects."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="article-meta"&gt;&lt;div class="author-bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khloe Quill is a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank"&gt;lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; production assistant with Fox News Digital.

It'll probably go away,' Dashow, 29, told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two months later, the 26-year-old had just earned her doctoral degree in psychology and off handedly mentioned her pain to her therapist, who &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13342039/Florida-woman-diagnosed-stage-4-melanoma.html"&gt;urged her to see a doctor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[My therapist] said "It's your eye. You should definitely take that seriously." And what was kind of ironic is that I'm someone who's always been on top of my medical issues. I'll go to my appointments, I take my health seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I do what I can. But this was the one time in my life that I actually wasn't taking it seriously. I think because it was so intermittent and it wasn't that uncomfortable.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She called her local optometrist looking for an upcoming appointment, but they told her to come in right away after hearing her symptoms. While her doctor said 'everything looked fine,' he noted there was fluid buildup behind the retina and referred her to specialist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dashow told the Daily Mail that the retina doctor performed several scans of her eye, including an ultrasound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Allison Dashow, pictured above in 2025, was diagnosed with a rare eye cancer three years ago at 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dashow before undergoing treatment for her ocular melanoma, which consisted of a surgery to insert a radioactive plaque into the back of the affected eye&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctor came in, he took a &lt;span&gt;couple looks at my scans, and he said, "This is very interesting. I want to bring in my colleague."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'So at that point, I thought: "Oh gosh, &lt;/span&gt;I don't want to be an interesting patient." So the colleague came in, and they were just grilling me with a bunch of&lt;span&gt; questions about family history and symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And they ended up saying, "The good news is it's not eye cancer." And I was like, "Great; I didn't even know that was something we were considering, but I'm glad to know it isn't."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dashow was initially diagnosed with choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a condition in which abnormal blood vessels grow in the choroid - the layer of tissue underneath the retina. This can damage the retina and lead to vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CNV is typically caused by old age, degeneration of the eye, nearsightedness, complications from diabetes or other retinal diseases - none of which Dashow had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors recommended injectable treatments be started right away, but Dashow sought a second opinion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A week later, she underwent more scans with a new doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dashow, now 29, after her surgery with a covering over the affected eye - she wore it for seven days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ocular melanoma, a type of eye cancer, is one of the only cancers that can be diagnosed without a traditional biopsy. Based on the scans, her new doctor diagnosed her with the disease - specifically, choroidal melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That was obviously a huge shock because I didn't go into that appointment expecting to hear that,' Dashow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are about 2,000 new cases of ocular melanoma every year, according to the Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is an extremely rare cancer, affecting six in one million Americans annually, but the second-most diagnosed form of melanoma. Melanoma of the skin is the most common, with about one case in every 50 Americans annually.&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like skin cancer, the eye variety begins in the melanocytes - cells that produce the pigment that colors the skin, hair and eyes, and also form moles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Tate Kirk (pictured) is being honored at this year's MRF gala, receiving the Cure OM Vision of Hope Award&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dashow's specific type of ocular melanoma, choroidal melanoma, begins in the layer of blood vessels - the choroid - beneath the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the most common type of ocular melanoma, according to the Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Dr Tate Kirk, an interventional radiologist who works with ocular melanoma patients, told the Daily Mail that many people have never heard of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everybody has heard of skin cancer melanoma, but ocular melanoma is very, very rare... and the cause is not very well known or understood,' Kirk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that the disease is known to more likely be diagnosed in fair-skinned, blue-eyed people. Dashow has a fair complexion but does not have blue eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While sun exposure is a commonly known cause of melanoma of the skin, the role it plays in ocular melanoma is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her diagnosis, Dashow's doctor recommended a laser treatment plan. But again, she sought a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I did some research,' Dashow said. 'I saw just how fatal this cancer can be if it spreads.'&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kirk told the Daily Mail that the cancer spreads in about half of ocular melanoma patients. A 2009 study found the spread typically happens within 10 to 15 years of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most often, the cancer travels to the liver where it becomes difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's the worst thing that happens and the thing that leads eventually to demise,' he said. 'You get metastatic disease in your liver and it grows - it's difficult to treat.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there are no definitive cures for ocular melanoma, patients can be treated with a specialized laser therapy or plaque brachytherapy. These treatments kill the tumor and while doctors don't declare patients 'cured,' they are considered to be what is called NED, no evidence of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dashow decided to look into treatment options herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a very serious cancer, and when I was diagnosed, I really didn't understand the severity of it and what this meant for my life moving forward,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'And so then I listened to Dr Paul Finger's podcast. He's an ocular oncologist in New York City, and he does not recommend that laser treatment &lt;/span&gt;because it doesn't get all the margins of the cells, and there's a higher rate of recurrence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went to Finger for a second opinion regarding treatment, and ended up getting plaque brachytherapy instead on June 30, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dashow (right) with her medical oncologist Dr Richard Carvajal (left) at the 2023 MRF gala&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plaque brachytherapy has been used since 1915 and became the standard treatment for ocular melanoma in the '90s. The treatment consists of sewing a radioactive plaque into the back of the cancerous eye for seven days to kill the disease. Patients are considered radioactive and must social distance, but the treatment yields a lower rate of spread and recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the week, the plaque is removed and the tumor is considered dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About six months after Dashow's plaque was removed, her oncologist declared her tumor was dead. She continues to be considered NED, and sees Dr Richard Carvajal for checkups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in 2023, she developed radiation retinopathy, which occurs in 50 percent of patients who receive plaque brachytherapy. It is a slow progressive eye disease in which blood vessels in the retina become damaged from radiation therapy. It can eventually lead to other diseases of the eye like glaucoma, cataracts and blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for radiation retinopathy, but Dashow undergoes injections every five weeks in her left eye to slow the progression and preserve her vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, three years after her diagnosis, Dashow is working to raise awareness for the rare cancer. She is this year's recipient of the Melanoma Research Foundation's Courage Award, which she will receive at the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://us.givergy.com/MRFNYGala25/?controller=home"&gt;foundation's annual gala&lt;/a&gt; later this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dashow first became involved with MRF when she began working to raise awareness of ocular melanoma, and credits the organization with helping her find a 'community' of other patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's such an incredible organization... a&lt;span&gt;nd without them, I don't know if I ever would have met anyone with this cancer because it is so rare, and it's really helped me sort of find a community,' she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'There's just something really special about it. and I feel so much gratitude for the MRF.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kirk is also being honored at this year's gala, receiving the CURE OM Vision of Hope Award for his groundbreaking work with ocular melanoma patients who have had their disease spread to the liver.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dashow told Daily Mail about how her diagnosis has impacted her: '&lt;span&gt;I try and remind myself that I have this awful thing that I was diagnosed with, and there's a lot of uncertainty and fear as to what will happen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'And at the same time, I have an incredible life and &lt;/span&gt;family and friends and job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So I think I really just try to not ignore the bad. U&lt;span&gt;nfortunately, these were the cards I've been dealt, and I can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;suffer and be mad at the world and be bitter, or I can accept sort of what's happened, and try to just live my life day to day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'So I do think it's helped me be more present in the moment in my life... and a little bit more level-headed. That's the silver lining.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;/svg&gt;
						&lt;/button&gt;
						
					&lt;/p&gt;

					
						&lt;p&gt;What began as a routine breast reduction surgery led to a potentially life-saving discovery. When 45-year-old Kim Burris was recovering at home in Chapel Hill, she received a call that changed her life.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; For most of her adult life, Burris thought about getting a breast reduction. She struggled with back pain, clothing that didn’t fit well and constant discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Three years after having her daughter and going through the journey of breastfeeding, she decided it was time.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; “I felt like an imposter in my own body, in many ways,” she said. “I felt like I wanted to do something for myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; During the surgery, Raleigh plastic surgeon Dr. Heather Levites noticed something abnormal. She removed the tissue and sent it out for testing. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Any piece of breast tissue that comes out of your body should be sent to a pathologist,” Levites said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The results came back as ductal carcinoma in situ, also known as DCIS, the most common form of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/raleigh-surgeon-spots-early-stage-breast-cancer-october-2025"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;DCIS starts in the breast ducts and can spread to surrounding tissue. Early signs include painless lumps in the breast or armpit, redness, changes to the nipple, one breast being larger than the other and a red rash. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I think for a moment I had one of those out of body experiences,” Burris said when she first received the news. “I was numb, very numb, and shocked because I wasn’t anticipating that. But she did a really great job at putting me at ease and giving me all the facts. I’m a very fact-driven person.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; Burris’ grandmother had breast cancer. She had been getting routine mammograms, which are the best tool for early breast cancer detection. However, the screenings did not pick up the DCIS. The only symptom Burris had was a clogged milk duct, which she associated with breastfeeding. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Levities connected Burris to Dr. Jennifer Plichta, a surgical oncologist at Duke Cancer Center. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Early detection of breast cancer increases survival rates, reduces the risk of cancer spreading to other areas of the body and allows for less invasive treatment options. In addition, it empowers women to take control of their health and provides a sense of control, and reduces anxiety, according to the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Levites said being proactive is the first step in preventive treatment, and self-exams are usually the first indication something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We are our own best advocates. We know our bodies best,” Levites said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Due to the early detection of DCIS, Burris does not require additional treatment. She said she will continue to take preventative measures and schedule routine check-ups. &lt;/p&gt;

The research also uncovered a significant delay in the diagnosis of ADHD for women, which may contribute to these more challenging outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation was prompted by growing recognition that ADHD affects individuals differently, particularly across sexes. While historically viewed as a condition predominantly affecting boys, it is now understood that ADHD persists into adulthood for many and that women are often underdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by Ferran Mestres sought to clarify how sex and the specific subtype of ADHD influence the disorder’s severity, its connection to other mental health conditions, and its impact on a person’s ability to function in daily life. By examining these factors, the team aimed to build a more detailed understanding that could help improve diagnosis and treatment for different patient groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their research, the scientific team recruited 900 adults who had been diagnosed with ADHD at a specialized clinic at the Vall d’Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Of the participants, just under 55 percent were male. Each individual underwent an extensive evaluation process that spanned five separate visits with psychiatrists and psychologists specializing in ADHD. This comprehensive assessment confirmed their ADHD diagnosis and determined their specific presentation, which can be predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed a wide range of validated questionnaires and assessments. These tools were used to measure the intensity of their ADHD symptoms, both currently and during childhood. The evaluations also gauged levels of depression, anxiety, and impulsivity. Additional instruments assessed sleep quality and the disorder’s effect on psychosocial functioning and overall disability. The researchers then used statistical methods to compare the results between men and women and between different ADHD subtypes. They also analyzed how sex and subtype might interact to influence outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings revealed notable differences between men and women. One of the most significant discoveries was the age of diagnosis. Although symptoms of ADHD appeared to begin at a similar age for both sexes, women received their diagnosis much later, at an average age of about 29 years, compared to an average age of 24 for men. At the time of their diagnosis, women reported more severe overall ADHD symptoms than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the core symptoms of ADHD, women in the study also experienced higher rates of other mental health challenges. They scored higher on measures of both depression and anxiety compared to their male counterparts. Functionally, women reported greater impairment in their social and professional lives and a higher degree of disability, suggesting the disorder had a more substantial negative effect on their day-to-day activities. In contrast, men with ADHD were more likely to have a history of legal problems and reported significantly higher rates of substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silvia Amoretti, a senior researcher involved in the study, commented on the findings. “ADHD affects millions of people, but our understanding of how it presents and impacts males and females differently remains limited. We found that females are underdiagnosed, often receiving a diagnosis years later than males. This delay may lead to worse clinical outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and functional impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Males on the other hand showed a higher level of involvement in delinquent behaviours such as legal problems and driving-related difficulties. We believe that a better understanding these sex-based differences might improve diagnosis and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined differences based on ADHD subtype. The combined presentation, which involves symptoms of both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, was linked to more severe outcomes overall. Individuals with the combined subtype had more intense ADHD symptoms, higher levels of depression, anxiety, and impulsivity. They were also more likely to engage in substance use and experience legal troubles compared to those with the predominantly inattentive subtype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then explored whether a person’s sex and their ADHD subtype interacted to produce unique outcomes. For most of the clinical measures, this was not the case, suggesting that the effects of sex and subtype were largely independent. However, one specific interaction emerged for disability. Women with the combined ADHD subtype reported the highest level of disability of any group, showing more significant impairment than men with the same subtype and more than individuals of either sex with the inattentive subtype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors propose several potential reasons for this specific finding. The interaction could be influenced by biological factors, such as the effect of female hormonal cycles on brain chemicals involved in attention and emotional regulation. Psychosocial factors, including societal expectations for women regarding organization and emotional control, may also play a part. The accumulated stress from years of unrecognized and untreated symptoms due to delayed diagnosis could also contribute to this heightened sense of disability in women with the combined presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that although ADHD symptoms started at a similar age in males and females, women were diagnosed about five years later. By the time of diagnosis, they showed more severe symptoms, worse functioning in daily life, and higher rates of depression and anxiety,” Amoretti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is important because it shows that ADHD often goes unnoticed in women until it becomes a serious problem. Our findings suggest that we may be missing the early signs in girls and women, especially when their symptoms are less disruptive but still impactful. This has clear implications for earlier screening and sex-sensitive diagnostic tools,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t set out to compare the age of diagnosis in males and females, we were aiming to understand the general age when symptoms appear, regardless of sex. This finding was not part of our initial hypotheses but became evident during the analysis, and the scale of the difference in diagnosis between the sexes was a surprise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s likely that women are diagnosed later because the symptoms of ADHD manifest themselves differently in men and women. Boys are more likely to be hyperactive or impulsive, and this behaviour is more visible to parents, teachers and clinicians. On the other hand, girls with ADHD are more likely to seem inattentive and generally less disruptive. This becomes clinically important, as it means that women are just not treated early enough, and often are just not diagnosed at all. We have seen similar tendencies internationally, so it is likely that this is a global problem. The nature of the condition leads to poorer diagnosis in women everywhere, meaning that women can lose on average five years of treatment, 5 years of a better life,” Amoretti concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Sandra Kooij, an independent expert who was not involved in the study, commented on the research. “This study by Sylvia Amoretti and colleagues shows the delay in diagnosis in girls and women with ADHD compared to boys and males. Different presentation of symptoms, lack of awareness among clinicians that women have ADHD too, and the hormonal changes leading to severe mood instability in the last week of the cycle are all responsible for the gender differences in time to diagnosis of ADHD. Increasing awareness in both society and medicine helps girls and women to get earlier help when they need it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study noted some limitations. The participants were recruited from a specialized treatment center, so the findings may not be fully representative of all adults with ADHD. The study design also captures a snapshot in time and cannot determine cause-and-effect relationships. Even with these considerations, the large sample size and the use of multiple validated tools provide strong evidence for the different ways ADHD can manifest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could follow individuals over time to better understand these dynamics and explore how factors like socioeconomic status or biological conditions might interact with sex and subtype to shape ADHD outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2025.2441" target="_blank"&gt;Sex differences in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A population-based study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Ferran Mestres, Vanesa Richarte, Juan Jesús Crespín, Carla Torrent, Santiago Biel, Carolina Ramos, Pol Ibáñez, Laura Oltra-Arañó, Montse Corrales, Silvia Amoretti, Christian Fadeuilhe, and Josep Antoni Ramos-Quiroga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 16:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOVk1IY1lWUS11TU1QTER4QldncWwtaHVZTlVyY1BqQkk2XzRaTThOQW1rWGtwQnpEUzNLNjh6OUg3Uk1RSk5GX3BabkE3emdKS2h2dnFRdV9UTFc2aUNZZGJmRmhmd2tYWnNZZGd3SzFtSlZzSVlyRWtyQVNUZU1BaGFSWFBuY0JXZWRYdmxublcyTTA2dTN6TGdyMVE</guid></item><item><title>营养师为初学者制定的5天地中海饮食计划- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/5-day-mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-for-beginners-11826840</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7527550/you-just-started-the-mediterranean-diet-here-are-the-recipes-to-make-first/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy Mediterranean Diet recipes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 478 to 588 calories, while the lunches span 231 to 538 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_127-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet is one of the most well-studied eating patterns in the world, with research showing it can help lower the risk of heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers and even neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Much of its power comes from polyphenols and antioxidants naturally found in plant-based foods, which have strong anti-inflammatory properties. By reducing chronic inflammation, this way of eating supports overall health and longevity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_128-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_129-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond physical health, promising research suggests the Mediterranean diet may also boost brain health. Studies link it to improved memory, reduced risk of cognitive decline and even better mood regulation, making it as good for your mind as it is for your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The best part? This style of eating is approachable for beginners. Many of your favorite foods already fit the plan, making it easy to get started.&lt;br&gt;

Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor.

It can also be turned into a sweet dish like kheer or pudding. Some even mix it with coconut milk, jaggery, or dry fruits for added richness and nutrition. Its chewy texture and deep, nutty flavour make it versatile in both traditional and modern recipes, whether as a comforting porridge, festive dessert, or even a nourishing breakfast bowl that keeps you full and energized for hours. Rich in fibre, minerals, and natural antioxidants, it supports digestion, sustains energy levels, and complements a balanced, healthy lifestyle rooted in mindful, home-style eating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Images Courtesy: istock&lt;br&gt;Disclaimer: The information provided in this article is meant for general knowledge only and should not be taken as medical advice.

Brown eggs vs. white eggs—which is healthier? Some choose the brand or type of eggs they want regardless of the color, while others stick to the same hue every time they buy a new dozen.

There is no difference,” says Koenig. That means that regardless of the color eggs you choose, you’ll get nutrients like 6 g of complete &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a68067521/signs-not-getting-enough-protein/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; per egg, plus vitamins A, D, E, K, and others, choline, antioxidants, and healthy fats. These deliver benefits like energy and satiety, support for mood regulation and muscle control, and reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.incredibleegg.org/nutrition/articles/what-are-the-nutritional-differences-for-different-types-of-eggs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Egg Board;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Egg Board&lt;/a&gt;, brown and white eggs will still contain the same nutrient profiles, whether they are cage-free, free-range, conventional, or organic. They explain that these labels refer exclusively to the way the eggs are farmed and that the only way to change the nutrient content of the eggs themselves is to feed the hens a fortified diet (the increased levels of fortified nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids or &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a66133153/best-time-take-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, would be noted in the nutrition facts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9102658/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Molecules;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;compared the nutritional components of organic and conventional eggs, finding that organic eggs actually had higher levels of nutrients needed for infant and child growth and development, and conventional eggs had more that were beneficial for fat metabolism and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65628846/foods-to-lower-cholesterol-naturally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reducing cholesterol;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reducing cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, despite both containing cholesterol. Though ultimately, both had plenty of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The color of the eggshell reflects the color of the hen that laid the egg. “It’s as fun and as simple as that,” says Delaney.

            Humans are living 20 years longer than they were in 1950, according to new research with all 204 countries and territories studied reporting declines in their mortality rates since then. But vast inequities remain, and there is an “emerging crisis” of rising death rates among adolescents and young adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n00043b6nygi8gdbo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2023, life expectancy was 76.3 years for women and 71.5 years for men, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01330-3/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;analyses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;published Sunday in the journal The Lancet by the University of Washington School of Medicine’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) – returning to pre-pandemic levels after falling during the height of Covid.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Covid-19 fell from the leading cause of death in 2021 to 20th place in 2023, with heart disease and stroke rising to again become the leading causes of death globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Deaths worldwide have generally been shifting away from infectious disease, with sharp declines in deaths from measles, diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flancet%2Farticle%2FPIIS0140-6736(25)01917-8%2Ffulltext&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ce46539032fd94f627b5908de081ff30c%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638957130480695273%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=O3XV4oJjSMU2XHU4VyGS7XofJf6XMtXSiGOqaDVWMFw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;according to IHME&lt;/a&gt;.

            Noncommunicable diseases now account for about two-thirds of global mortality and morbidity, including both deaths and broader burden from disease. Although mortality rates for heart disease and stroke have declined since 1990, rates have increased for diabetes, chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n00083b6nchela7zu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The rapid growth in the world’s aging population and evolving risk factors have ushered in a new era of global health challenges,” IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray said. “The evidence presented in the Global Burden of Disease study is a wake-up call, urging government and health care leaders to respond swiftly and strategically to the disturbing trends that are reshaping public health needs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            About half of the world’s disease burden is preventable, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01637-X/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;, attributable to dozens of modifiable risk factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000a3b6nwwcl3gra@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity are among the 10 risk factors with the greatest effect, IHME found. Between 2010 and 2023, there was an 11% greater burden of disease due to high body mass index – measured by years of life lost due to disability or premature death – and a 6% increase due to high blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000b3b6nn64luxc9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Environmental factors such as particulate matter pollution and lead exposure were also among the most significant risk factors, along with those related to newborn health including low birthweight and short gestation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000c3b6ni77hsxvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, mental health plays a significant role in global mortality, according to the new research, with burden from anxiety and depression surging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000d3b6ncwalv4fx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the global population is growing and aging, death rates among children and young adults have increased in some parts of the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000e3b6nk0tpiggk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among adolescents and young adults, the largest increase in deaths over the past decade or so was among those ages 20 to 39 in high-income North America, mainly due to suicide, drug overdose and high quantities of alcohol, according to the IHME research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000f3b6nwqi3t8lw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deaths among those ages 5 to 19 also increased in Eastern Europe, high-income North America and the Caribbean, and among adolescents and young adults in sub-Saharan Africa, due to infectious diseases and unintentional injuries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000g3b6n1kgavw14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Globally, for children 5 to 14, iron deficiency was the leading risk, followed by others related to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene and malnutrition. For the 15 to 49 age group, the top two risks were unsafe sex and occupational injuries, followed by high BMI, high systolic blood pressure and smoking.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000h3b6nipvawn28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, life expectancy ranged from as high as 83 years in high-income regions to as low as 62 years in sub-Saharan Africa, IHME found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000i3b6nzvx9i1v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This new research highlights an “urgent need for policymakers to expand health priorities,” IHME researchers said – especially among adolescents and young adults – rather than limiting resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000j3b6np9apo3hh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Decades of work to close the gap in low-income regions with persistent health inequities are in danger of unraveling due to the recent cuts to international aid,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, senior author of the new studies&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and professor at IHME. “These countries rely on global health funding for life-saving primary care, medicine, and vaccines. Without it, the gap is sure to widen.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

It occurs when excess fat builds up inside liver cells, leading to serious liver damage and a higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Barcelona have now found a promising approach that could change how this condition is treated. Their study, published in &lt;em&gt;Pharmacological Research&lt;/em&gt;, reports that two existing drugs, pemafibrate and telmisartan, significantly reduced fat buildup in animal models of metabolic liver disease. The findings also suggest that using these medications together could ease liver damage while lowering related heart and blood vessel complications. Because available treatments for this disease remain very limited, the results point to a potentially safer and more effective therapeutic option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Marta Alegret, a professor at the University of Barcelona's Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences, and a member of the Institute of Biomedicine of the UB (IBUB) and the CIBER Area for Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBEROBN). The work was conducted in collaboration with scientists from the Santa Creu i Sant Pau Hospital Research Institute, the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, the CIBER Area for Cardiovascular Diseases (CIBERCV), and Uppsala University (Sweden).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;​​​​​​​Drug repurposing, a promising and cost-effective strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, most new experimental compounds developed for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) -- formerly known as fatty liver disease -- have failed during clinical trials, often because of safety concerns. This has turned attention toward drug repurposing, a strategy that explores new uses for medications already proven to be safe in humans. Such an approach is not only faster and more affordable but also particularly valuable for treating the early, often symptom-free stages of MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have focused on these phases with the aim of preventing the disease from progressing to more severe stages. But for a drug to be used in these early stages, it must have a good safety profile in humans," explains Marta Alegret. "That is why we have studied drugs already on the market for other pathologies, which have been shown to be very safe and could have a potential benefit in the treatment of MASLD," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the team evaluated the potential of two approved medications, given separately and together: a lipid-lowering agent (pemafibrate) and an antihypertensive drug (telmisartan). The first is marketed only in Japan, while the second is widely used for high blood pressure. Both are prescribed to reduce cardiovascular risk. "Mortality from cardiovascular causes is significant in patients with MASLD, and often these patients also have these two risk factors together," Alegret stresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zebrafish larvae, an alternative model for studying the disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm the efficacy of the drugs and explore their mechanism of action, the researchers have applied them to a rat model of the disease and, subsequently, to a zebrafish larval model. "In recent years, zebrafish have emerged as an interesting alternative model that facilitates the study of the pathophysiology of MASLD and the evaluation of treatments. These are simpler and cheaper models that allow results to be obtained more quickly and which, although they are not identical to humans, have a carbohydrate/lipid metabolism and liver physiology similar to those of mammals," says the UB professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show that the combination of the two drugs reverses the fat accumulation in the liver induced by a diet high in fat and fructose. In addition, in the rat model, the combined administration of half a dose of pemafibrate and half a dose of telmisartan was found to be as effective as a full dose of either drug in reducing fat accumulation. "Combination therapy with drugs acting on different pathogenic pathways may be a better strategy than monotherapy, thanks to possible synergistic effects and reduced toxicity related to the use of lower doses of each drug," Alegret points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of these two drugs would be beneficial not only for liver disease, but also because "it lowers blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and all this would result in a lower cardiovascular risk," she stresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​​​​​​​&lt;strong&gt;Different lipid-lowering mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; The study also found that each drug works by different mechanisms and describes, for the first time, the key role of the PCK1 protein in telmisartan-derived hepatic lipid lowering. "Telmisartan is a drug that has been used in other models of MASLD, but mostly in more advanced stages of the disease, and its beneficial effects have been attributed mainly to anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. But in the early stages of the disease there is no inflammation or fibrosis yet, only lipid accumulation," explains the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have now found that the amount of PCK1 protein in the livers of MASLD animals was reduced and that treatment with telmisartan restored its levels to normal. "This increase in PCK1 diverts the flux of metabolites from lipid synthesis to glucose synthesis. This increase in glucose production could be negative if the glucose were exported and accumulated in the blood, as it could lead to diabetes, but we have noticed that this is not the case," says the UB professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Still far from clinical application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these promising results, the researchers point out that, as this is a study using animal models, they are still far from patients. "In order to be translated into a treatment for MASLD patients, clinical studies would be needed to show that the benefits observed in animal models also occur in humans," says Alegret. ​​​​​​​ In any case, the results raise new questions, such as whether the drugs will be equally effective in more advanced stages of the disease, when fibrosis is present. The research team is therefore already working on new studies in animal models of diet-induced liver fibrosis. "In addition, we will develop a dual model involving liver fibrosis and cardiovascular disease to see if the beneficial action is observed not only in the liver, but also in the reduction of atherosclerosis," he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

For the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, researchers recruited 450 healthy volunteers in Germany. Of those, more than 99% had received the COVID-19 vaccine at least once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The participants were split into two groups: One used an azelastine nasal spray in each nostril at least three times a day for about 56 days.

You might reduce your risk of RSV and influenza as well,” he says. “There seems to be no risk to using the medications.” Though, more research is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Alan agrees, noting that there’s likely no harm to using azelastine as long as you’re not allergic to any of the ingredients in the nasal spray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Dr. Russo points out that it’s tricky to use a nasal spray several times a day. “The data suggest that if you use this three to five times a day, it may be similar to decreasing the likelihood of contracting COVID as getting the vaccine,” he says. “But it’s really hard to take a medication once a day, let alone five times a day.” For many people, it’s ultimately easier—and cheaper—to just get the vaccine, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Schaffner agrees. “Getting people to be compliant with this over the entire COVID season is substantial,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Dr. Russo says there may be some benefit in using azelastine before a big event. “You may think, ‘I’m going to a wedding and it’s going to be a high-risk situation.’ So, you might start taking this a few days beforehand and a few days afterward as extra protection,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;AS there’s no data comparing azelastine to more traditional methods of preventing COVID-19, like getting the vaccine and wearing masks, doctors recommend doing those first. “This should not be a substitute for vaccination,” Dr. Schaffner says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Adalja agrees. “In the best-case scenario, it will likely have a complementary role to vaccines—especially if shown to block infection, which vaccines against COVID are not able to do durably—and possibly provide protection against viruses for which there are no vaccines,” he says. But ultimately, doctors say that more research is needed first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 12:31:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOdVctbFhrenhzY1liZUo4RTVqaDJMVVFUcFlhWHV3cWg1VlJJS2E3Q3MtNlB0MDZ1VW1ReGJDNlRXMEJjY3lkRmE0dkNMTVhQcFRYcURTeVZYOWx1MDRCY01TWi15V2Y2OUVHbWo4dlNrYUlKRW9vY055bjZsSExQekVQTExGNEg4ZUhmYmdrb1QzcWlK</guid></item><item><title>大多数人很少使用人工智能，而黑暗的个性特征可以预测谁更常使用它- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/most-people-rarely-use-ai-and-dark-personality-traits-predict-who-uses-it-more/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/21522715251379987" target="_blank"&gt;Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that while artificial intelligence receives significant public attention, it is used far less frequently in day-to-day online activity than many might assume. Drawing from more than 14 million website visits, researchers found that AI-related browsing made up less than one percent of online activity for most people. The study also indicates that individuals who use AI more often tend to exhibit certain aversive personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is growing public and academic interest in artificial intelligence, particularly its expanding role in education, work, and entertainment. While many surveys have asked people whether they use AI and how they feel about it, these self-reports are often unreliable. People tend to misjudge or misremember how often they use technology, especially newer forms like AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move beyond self-reported data, the researchers set out to directly measure AI use through people’s actual web browsing histories. Their goal was to determine how often AI tools are used in everyday life, identify who uses them the most, and examine what types of online activities are typically associated with AI use. Understanding the psychological traits linked to higher levels of AI interaction could help researchers and policymakers anticipate how different groups may adopt or resist AI technologies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been enormous public discussion about AI and its societal impact, but surprisingly little objective data on how people actually use it in their everyday browsing,” said study author &lt;a href="https://emilykmckinley.scholar.st/" target="_blank"&gt;Emily McKinley&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite widespread concerns and excitement about tools like ChatGPT, we had almost no baseline understanding of actual usage patterns. We wanted to measure what’s really happening, examining not just usage frequency, but also the psychological profiles of AI adopters and how AI integrates into their broader digital behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project included two separate studies. The first involved 499 university students from two institutions, while the second focused on 455 members of the general public. In both cases, participants shared their web browsing history over a period of up to 90 days. Only those who used Google Chrome were included, as this browser allowed for the necessary data export. Participants also completed surveys measuring their personality traits, attitudes toward AI, and demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a list of well-known AI websites, such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, the researchers identified which browser visits were AI-related. Other websites were categorized using a content classification system powered by a large language model. The researchers then analyzed the data to understand the proportion of AI visits relative to total browsing, what kinds of websites were visited immediately before and after using AI, and which psychological traits correlated with AI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the student sample, AI use made up just 1 percent of all website visits on average. Most participants rarely used AI at all, and only a small number accounted for the majority of the traffic. The most commonly visited AI site by far was ChatGPT, representing over 85 percent of all AI-related visits. While this use rate was higher than visits to web versions of some social media platforms like Instagram, it was far below the rate of search engine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were genuinely surprised by how infrequent AI use was, even among students who typically serve as early adopters of emerging technologies,” McKinley told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students who used AI more often were slightly more likely to score high on personality traits associated with narcissism and psychopathy. These individuals also tended to have more positive attitudes toward AI in general. There were some weak associations between AI use and demographics, such as income and gender, but age and ethnicity were not significantly related to AI use in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the general public sample showed even lower rates of AI use, with an average of just 0.44 percent of website visits being AI-related. Once again, ChatGPT was the most visited AI platform. Fewer significant correlations between personality and AI use were observed in this group, but there was a modest relationship between Machiavellianism and AI browsing. Those who expressed more favorable views of AI were also somewhat more likely to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers paid particular attention to individuals they called “prolific users,” defined as those whose AI browsing accounted for more than 4 percent of their total website visits. Among the student group, these prolific users scored much higher on measures of Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy compared to their peers. These patterns were less clear in the general public sample, possibly because AI use was less frequent overall, reducing the ability to detect meaningful differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, people who use AI more tend to score higher on aversive personality traits, particularly Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy, though these patterns were stronger among students,” McKinley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both groups, the researchers also analyzed what participants were doing online in the seconds before and after visiting an AI website. Before using AI, many were on internet and telecom sites, such as search engines and login pages. After AI use, participants were more likely to visit websites related to education, computers, or professional tasks. These patterns suggest that AI tools are often used as part of a workflow, especially in academic or job-related contexts. The researchers argue that this may point to AI being seen more as a productivity tool than a source of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding involved the gap between self-reported and actual AI use. In the general public sample, participants were asked how often they believed they used AI. The correlation between their estimates and their actual browsing data was moderate, suggesting that self-reports alone are not a reliable way to assess AI use. This result aligns with previous research on other forms of media, where people often underreport or overreport their habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study provides rare objective data on AI use, there are still some limitations. First, the analysis was limited to web-based interactions. Mobile app use, which may be more common for some users, was not included. Similarly, only Google Chrome users could participate, which may have influenced the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also focused primarily on a narrow set of individual traits, such as personality and basic demographics. Other factors, such as emotional well-being, motivations, or social environments, could play an important role in AI adoption but were not examined here. The team suggests that future studies should explore how these additional psychological and social variables relate to AI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note the importance of understanding what people are doing during their time on AI platforms. While this study captured how often users visited AI websites, it could not track whether they were writing essays, solving problems, or simply exploring out of curiosity. Capturing the content of interactions could shed light on the goals and intentions behind AI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, as AI becomes more integrated into daily life, usage patterns may change. The researchers plan to continue this line of inquiry by examining whether AI use is linked to specific outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to understand not just how often people use AI, but what they’re using it for and how that content relates to their individual characteristics,” McKinley explained. “We’re also interested in examining the downstream consequences of AI use: for example, does actual usage predict outcomes like academic integrity, information-seeking behaviors, or work performance?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research represents one of the first attempts to objectively quantify AI use in naturalistic settings using months of actual browsing data. While AI currently dominates many of our cultural conversations, the data suggest most people are still using it quite sparingly. The methodological approach we developed, combining passive digital trace data with psychological measures, offers a valuable template for future technology research, helping us move beyond the limitations of self-report and understand how individual differences shape technology adoption in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/21522715251379987" target="_blank"&gt;Evaluating Artificial Intelligence Use and Its Psychological Correlates via Months of Web-Browsing Data&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Emily McKinley, David M.

			&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-signal-of-dementia-risk-may-keep-you-up-at-night-study-says"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; can lead to improvements in care and in treatments, and a new study identifies a link between changes in brain shape and declines in cognitive functions – such as memory and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that some of the wear and tear that eventually leads to dementia can also alter the brain's structure and shape, and looking out for these shifts could be a relatively simple way of revealing dementia early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These new findings are from researchers at the University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine) and the University of La Laguna in Spain, and they build on what we already know about how the brain naturally shrinks &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/archneur.60.7.989"&gt;as we get older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-neuron-that-whispers-to-real-brain-cells-created-in-amazing-first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial Neuron That 'Whispers' to Real Brain Cells Created in Amazing First&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most studies of brain aging focus on how much tissue is lost in different regions," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/10/01/brain-shape-changes-could-offer-early-warning-signs-of-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Niels Janssen, from the University of La Laguna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we found is that the overall shape of the brain shifts in systematic ways, and those shifts are closely tied to whether someone shows cognitive impairment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176711" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176711" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BrainChart.jpg" alt="Brain chart" class="wp-image-176711 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BrainChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BrainChart-526x415.jpg 526w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BrainChart-600x474.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176711" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study charted brain structure changes across specific regions. (Escalante et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat.

A lot more data is going to be required to establish these relationships more precisely, but this study suggests they exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are further implications for neurodegenerative diseases &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, where brain damage accumulates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose that a crucial memory hub called the entorhinal cortex may be put under pressure by age-related shape shifts – and that's the same region where toxic proteins linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="176708" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; typically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/bjbs.2024.13169"&gt;start congregating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-177073" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could help explain why the entorhinal cortex is ground zero of Alzheimer's pathology," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/10/01/brain-shape-changes-could-offer-early-warning-signs-of-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Michael Yassa, from UC Irvine. "If the aging brain is gradually shifting in a way that squeezes this fragile region against a rigid boundary, it may create the perfect storm for damage to take root."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding that process gives us a whole new way to think about the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and the possibility of early detection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More brain scans and more precise measurements will help progress this research further. The team is keen to explore why some brain areas may expand with age and how this relates to cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway: it's evidence that it's not just the brain volume that matters in health and aging, but also the 3D shape of the brain – made up of many different regions all working together to keep our minds &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-many-crosswords-each-week-could-benefit-our-brains-as-we-age"&gt;sharp and active&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're just beginning to unlock how brain geometry shapes disease," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/10/01/brain-shape-changes-could-offer-early-warning-signs-of-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Yassa. "But this research shows that the answers may be hiding in plain sight – in the shape of the brain itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63628-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C is necessary for a healthy immune system, joints and disease prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average adult needs 75 mg to 90 mg per day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits, bell peppers and cruciferous veggies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It may take a sniffly nose, sneezing or a pesky cough to bring vitamin C to mind. Getting sick reminds us of our immune function, which may leave you wondering whether you should take vitamin C daily. Vitamin C is a well-known vitamin in citrus fruits that many people turn to when under the weather. That's because it can enhance immune health and may reduce the length of a cold.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But immune function isn't the only thing vitamin C is necessary for. It's also a crucial nutrient and antioxidant that aids in producing compounds that support different body functions. So, can you benefit from taking a regular vitamin C supplement? Read on to learn more about what happens when you take vitamin C every day.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it's common to find bare shelves of vitamin C during flu season, how it impacts immunity is unclear. That said, we do know the skin needs normal levels of vitamin C to maintain a healthy barrier to keep harmful pathogens from entering the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is also present in immune cells, so having sufficient levels is vital. Low levels of vitamin C could make you more susceptible to sickness. As an antioxidant, vitamin C protects cells from oxidative damage and regulates anti-inflammatory pathways, helping reduce inflammation and, therefore, the risk of chronic health conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consuming vitamin C may help alleviate lead exposure. Lead is a heavy metal found in some paint, jewelry, soil and other products that is poisonous in high concentrations. Even the most minor blood levels of lead can impact how well a child performs in school. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, routinely eating foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin C may help keep lead out of the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, more research is needed to understand the beneficial effects. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to one small study, iron deficiency is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Populations most at risk are infants, young children, pregnant people and females of reproductive age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The CDC recommends improving iron absorption by pairing an iron-rich food with a vitamin C-rich food, such as mandarin oranges with salad greens.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And some studies have seen significant differences in iron levels when supplementing with vitamin C and iron compared to iron alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is especially true of non-heme iron, the type of iron found in plants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is necessary to form collagen, a vital part of connective tissue, which helps mend wounds. While research is mixed on this topic, many studies support vitamin C supplementation for reducing pain and inflammation related to osteoarthritis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is partly due to vitamin C's role in collagen formation, as well as its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to vitamin C's powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, there is evidence that it may act as an anti-tumor agent.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers note that vitamin C is not a replacement for traditional cancer treatment, but an adjunct to it. When used in this way, it may improve treatment results.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is evidence that vitamin C protects neurons (brain cells) against oxidative stress and may be helpful to mental health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, one study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that older adults with higher vitamin C intake had lower rates of cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers note that these benefits plateaued at about 500 mg/day of vitamin C, suggesting that more than this offers no further brain benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people have sufficient vitamin C intake because many consume foods naturally rich in vitamin C or fortified with it. Yet, others may need more. According to the National Cancer Institute, 7% of people in the U.S. have scurvy, a condition where vitamin C levels fall below normal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Scurvy happens from eating too few vitamin C sources or impaired absorption in the digestive tract. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Symptoms of vitamin C deficiency include:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Loss of teeth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swollen, bleeding gums&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor wound healing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anemia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin's outer layer)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arthralgia (stiff joints)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How much vitamin C you need depends on your age, sex and whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding. The average adult male needs 90 mg per day, while the average adult female needs 75 mg per day. If you're pregnant, you need 85 mg per day, and if you're breastfeeding, shoot for 120 mg per day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While oranges tend to be the go-to for vitamin C, this nutrient hangs out in lots of nourishing sources, with many of them &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052728/6-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;having more vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; than an orange.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The recommended daily amount of vitamin C for adults is 90 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Overloading yourself with vitamin C is unlikely, since our body rids what it can't use in urine, but it is still possible to overdo it. For example, digestive upset, including stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea, commonly occurs when unabsorbed vitamin C is in the intestines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High vitamin C levels can cause increases in oxalates, which make you more prone to kidney stones, especially for people with poor kidney function. For example, one review reports that vitamin C doses greater than 1 gram may increase the chances of stone formation by 41%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The same review reported that women taking too much vitamin C during pregnancy could result in rebound scurvy in newborn babies. Excess vitamin C may also affect vitamin B12 and copper levels and cause dental enamel erosion. Because of these health risks, an upper limit for adults ages 19 and up is 2,000 mg daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, some people may be taking more under the supervision of a medical provider.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vitamin-c-supplements-8686368" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C supplements&lt;/a&gt; in various forms, such as powders, gummies, chewable tablets, non-chewable tablets and capsules. When looking for one, consider what form of vitamin C will help you be consistent. If mixing powdered vitamin C with water isn't for you, you might choose chewable. If you dislike swallowing pills, you may enjoy gummies, but if you are sensitive to added sugar, you might opt for a capsule. Choose the form that works best for your lifestyle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Take a close look at supplement ingredient lists to pinpoint any additives it may have, such as artificial colors, added sugars, preservatives or fillers. And while the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;doesn't regulate supplements&lt;/a&gt;, you can still take steps to ensure your supplement is reliable, safe and effective. Independent labeling can help identify a trustworthy supplement. USP, NSF and ConsumerLabs are examples of independent labels to seek on the packaging or bottle to help ensure you're getting honest ingredients.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements can be costly, and a routine daily dose of a vitamin C supplement isn't necessary for healthy people, since most people have healthy vitamin C levels. Talk to your healthcare provider first if you're considering taking a vitamin C supplement. Otherwise, if you're concerned about getting enough vitamin C foods, simply turn to your local market and stock up on vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables. Whether fresh, frozen or canned, produce like pineapple, potatoes and bell peppers are plentiful in vitamin C, and enjoying more of them can meet your everyday needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C can be safe to take daily; however, it's helpful to know that you can meet your daily needs by eating vitamin C-rich foods. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-kiwi-8650515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a half-cup of kiwi&lt;/a&gt; offers 134 mg of vitamin C, which provides 148% to 178% of the recommended daily needs. Before taking any new supplements, it's best practice to speak with your medical provider and stay below the upper limit for vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing beats getting vitamin C from whole foods, which is the ultimate form. Many foods are brimming with vitamin C, like citrus fruits, cruciferous veggies and potatoes. If you're still interested in a vitamin C supplement, the best form to take is synthetic ascorbic acid and the presentation you can easily ingest, which for some could be a mixable powder and, for others, an easy-to-swallow capsule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.rappler.com/topic/hiv-philippines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; has earned the unenviable — and embarrassing —  title of “the country with the fastest rising rates of HIV in Asia and the Pacific.” While the region overall has experienced a 13% drop in the number of cases since 2010, the Philippines has reported a 550% increase between 2010 and 2024, prompting the DOH to push for declaring HIV a public health emergency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not an overnight development — the epidemic has been simmering for decades, having transitioned from “low and slow” in the early 2000s to “fast and furious” in the past two decades, with no signs of slowing down.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest DOH HIV quarterly report, covering April-June 2025, confirms once again the upward trajectory of HIV in the country: 5,000 new cases were recorded — an average of &lt;a href="https://www.rappler.com/philippines/hiv-cases-january-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;56 new cases per day&lt;/a&gt; are being diagnosed, or one every 25 minutes. In 2010, approximately six new cases per day were reported. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if we have fewer cases in total compared to countries like Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, these countries have managed to rein in their new cases, with rates dropping overall.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in 2018, HIV surveillance findings in so-called “key populations,” showed that between 4% to 6% of all young men having sex with men (MSM), and transgender — with a sample of over 4,000 respondents — tested positive for HIV.  That’s about one in 20.  People who injected drugs, measured in “hot spots” in Cebu, had very high HIV prevalence — 29%, (roughly over one person in four) in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
	
	




&lt;p&gt;But why declare it a public health emergency only now? I&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;believe this is due to a drying up of funding for HIV (and for general development assistance) from the US Government. The decapitation of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) by the Trump administration, to the “sun setting” (rather facetious term for closure) of the Joint United Nations Program on AIDS (UNAIDS) has led to major shortfalls in an already underfunded global HIV response. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This ultimately affects other programs such as PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, to the GFATM (Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria). All these agencies have been strong supporters of the HIV responses in the Philippines for decades now.  The Philippine government has gradually taken on a larger share of funding for HIV, particularly with regards to medications, and domestic resources are now the major source of funding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, most of the critical strategies and innovative responses, particularly those related to advocacy and working with CSOs, “key” populations such as drug users, sex workers, MSM and transgender people, are funded through international donors. Understandably, government staff and clinics are less able to reach these — and during the drug war, many simply became unreachable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hiv-is-mostly-sexually-transmitted-and-relatively-difficult-to-acquire"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIV is mostly sexually transmitted, and relatively difficult to acquire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are specific ways of HIV transmission:  unprotected sexual intercourse with someone who is able to transmit; sharing of unclean needles and injecting equipment, through transfusion of infected blood products, from a pregnant HIV positive mother to her unborn child, or during breastfeeding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Virtually all transmission through the blood, needles, pregnancy and breastfeeding routes have been practically eliminated — by effective screening of blood, during pregnancy, through prophylaxis, and ensuring that needles and injecting equipment are sterile, single-use, and sharing eliminated.  Both HIV and Hepatitis B are transmitted in identical ways, but a vaccine for Hep B is available, and none so far for HIV. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, 90% to 95% of all reported cases of HIV are due to sexual transmission; in some areas in Cebu, sharing of unclean needles by people who inject drugs is a significant route. Around 85% to 90% of all the new cases are among young men and trans women who report sexual contact with other men or trans.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One possible reason for rapid spread is the variant of HIV that is causing infection. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32081778/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; by Salvaña et al show that a particular HIV strain, (CRFo1AE) was seen in over 70% of all newly diagnosed cases of HIV between 2016-2018. This subtype was associated with higher viral loads, lower CD 4 counts on diagnosis, and faster progression to AIDS. It may also be a more “aggressive” subtype.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-only-three-of-five-pinoys-with-hiv-have-had-a-test-late-diagnosis-and-treatment-start-is-also-a-problem"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only three of five Pinoys with HIV have had a test; Late diagnosis and treatment start is also a problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;


&lt;p id="cx_inline" class="cx_inline inline-recommended-articles"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are an estimated 250,000 people with HIV in the Philippines, of which only approximately 57% know their HIV status. In Iloilo province, the percentage of those who know their HIV positive status is even lower — 45%, according to the Provincial Health Office. Of the 57%, just two thirds (66%) are on life-saving Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). Of those on ART, 47% have viral suppression — or levels of the virus that are so low that HIV transmission is no longer a possibility.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Late reporting and limited availability of testing for viral load may explain this low reported rate, as the drugs are very effective and generally viral suppression rates are over 95%.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The country is thus very unlikely to reach the “95-95-95” targets for HIV, which will lead to elimination of HIV as a public health threat by 2030. The first 95 refers to the % of people with HIV who know their status; the second 95 refers to the % of people with HIV who are on ART; and the last 95 refers to the % of people on ART with viral suppression. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Philippine figures, as of 2025, are merely 57-66-47. The pace of putting people on life-saving treatment cannot keep up with the pace of new infections being diagnosed each month.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, of those newly diagnosed, 25% are in an advanced stage of HIV disease — meaning, they have acquired HIV years ago, the immune system has deteriorated, with opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis and pneumocystis. CD 4 counts are very low and viral loads high.  &lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p class="rappler-ad-container"&gt;
		

					
			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="rappler-ad-container"&gt;
		

					
			&lt;/p&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;Late diagnosis and treatment means more complications, longer times for recovery, more misery, and higher death rates. In the country, 22% or 1 in 5 people on ART has been “lost to follow up,” a rate that should also be cause for alarm. Many who start treatment do not continue, or they drop out. Inadequate treatment leads to drug resistance and treatment failures. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-knowledge-about-hiv-instead-of-increasing-is-deteriorating"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge about HIV, instead of increasing, is deteriorating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Young peoples’ levels of knowledge about HIV have been declining over the years, as reported from the 2021 Young Adult Fertility Surveys (YAFS). AIDS awareness declined from 95% in 1994 and 2002, to 83% in 2013, and 76% in 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2021, 70% of respondents think they have no chance of getting HIV, a mere 15% know a place for HIV testing, and only 19% of the youth have comprehensive knowledge of HIV prevention and transmission. We must remember that every year, a new cohort of young people become sexually active, and lack the right information about HIV, and how to prevent it. All the prevention messages bear repeating year after year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not engaging in penetrative sex (i.e., vaginal or anal) reduces risk. Oral sex, sex with condoms and many forms of masturbation are considered low-risk, compared to unprotected (i.e., condom-less, or “bareback”) sex. However, one does not indulge in a single sexual practice during an encounter. It can start with kissing, foreplay, other forms of stimulation leading to oral, vaginal and/or anal intercourse, and may culminate in an orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even if people do know about safer sex, it is always not easy to say “no,” particularly if one is in the throes of emotions, or conflicted, or excited to try out new things and experiences. There may also be a sense of denial, coupled with rationalizations — &lt;em&gt;“I won’t get infected,” “he is so healthy looking, he could not possibly have HIV,” ”I won’t let him ejaculate in me,” “condoms reduce pleasure,”  “it’s only one person that I’ve had sex with,” or ”I did it only once naman,” etc. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Complicating the mix are sex parties, having numerous sexual partners, the concurrent use of alcohol, stimulants, and “chemsex” — when under the influences of such substances, one may completely forget protection, or may be too incapacitated to resist or say “no.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As one young yuppie put it, “it is difficult to control carnal desires” and so in the heat of sexual attraction, defenses crumble.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact is that Pinoys, of all genders, sexual orientations, religions and regions, are having sex, and bearing children. In the 2021 YAFS, 28% of male youth and 16% of females reported having sex before marriage. One in five young women between 15-24 has already had a child, or is currently pregnant. A third of these pregnancies are unwanted — despite all the admonitions about early pregnancy, or not having premarital sex.   &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;For someone sexually active now, the traditional “ABCD” messages — Abstain-Be Faithful-Condoms-Don’t inject drugs/share needles — from the ’80s and ’90s are supplemented by other methods.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PrEP (Pre-exposure prophylaxis), and self-testing for HIV (tests for HIV are available at drug stores, much like the pregnancy test kits). Condoms, used consistently, properly, and with the right type of lubricants, protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STI) and pregnancy. There are ways of negotiating safer sex practices that reduce the risks of HIV.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The slogan “U=U” (Undetectable=Untransmittable) means that a person with adequate treatment whose viral load is undetectable, is, for all practical purposes, no longer able to infect other people. This has enabled discordant partners (one HIV positive and the other HIV negative) to have a fulfilling sexual relationship, and have children, without the fear of possible transmission. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Accessibility of the prevention and treatment tools for ALL youth — including those in and out of school, those in prison or in rehab, with sensory and learning difficulties — need to be available. There are young people who are deaf, or have disabilities, and they are also having sexual lives; some may even be subjects of abuse and sexual exploitation.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is virtually no information on HIV for those with hearing disabilities, or with little comprehension of English or Tagalog. There are but a few groups that provide sexual health education for those who cannot hear, see, or who have physical and learning disabilities. Information is not available in different local languages, including braille and sign language, and there are very few trained interpreters.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are physical barriers to access, especially for people who may have mobility issues. Companions are needed when services are being accessed; transportation costs are higher for those with disabilities. Health workers express surprise and even disapproval at youth who are sexually active and not married, and may not be prepared to discuss sex and reproduction with those who have disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expansion-of-art-treatment-facilities"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion of ART Treatment facilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number of facilities offering ART treatment in Panay has increased. Apart from the West Visayas Medical Center (WVMC), there are now 20 HIV treatment hubs and outpatient HIV facilities in Panay, compared to six in 2021. San Jose de Buenavista and Culasi in Antique; Aklan has Boracay, Kalibo, New Washington while Capiz province has Roxas City and Dao. Iloilo has the most: Alimodian, Cabatuan, Calinog, Guimbal, Concepcion, Barotac Nuevo, Balasan, Janiuay, and Pototan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Iloilo City, treatment hubs are in St. Paul’s Hospital, The Medical City, WVSU Medical Center and the FPOP (Family Planning Organization of the Philippines). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People have a choice where they can seek treatment. Many do not wish to receive treatment in their own hometowns for fear of discovery.  Some may be having treatment with private practitioners and in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A listing of 300 treatment hubs and primary HIV care facilities nationwide is available from the &lt;a href="https://pia.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DOH-Designated-HIV-Treatment-Hubs-and-Primary-HIV-Care-Facilities-in-the-Philippines-As-of-Dec-31-2024.pdf?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExZ2RRNHFtZjB2Y0h1RnNLQQEeQRsbNTDmNM9I6hJpR0iVJOaZ4Iu87wajTRtPM_4Zd-C5Oe7WdIlPNYcOgdw_aem_3xdlAZpYeAXEc3ASnkgjDg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DOH and the PIA &lt;/a&gt;website. ART continues to be free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stigma-and-discrimination-are-major-barriers-a-comprehensive-approach-is-needed-to-combat-it"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stigma and discrimination are  major barriers – a comprehensive approach is needed to combat it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stigma and discrimination are major barriers to access. Stigma comes from the perception of HIV as a terminal illness (which it no longer is), contagious (which it is not) and association with people who are considered immoral, deviant, someone who is looked down on and ridiculed — a relic from the years when the then unknown, wasting illness was linked to the 4 Hs — homosexuals, hemophiliacs, heroin users, and haitians.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stigma may be external or/and internalized. Discrimination that reduces a person’s access to information and services is the most damaging; they may be reluctant to go to clinics or join community activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there is much stigma about being queer or gay, or being HIV positive, and use of drugs considered illegal, people are unlikely to come forward, get tested for HIV, and will hide or deny their status. They may not want to be seen in a facility that is frequented by people with HIV. Mandatory HIV testing is prohibited by law, but is still practiced.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NGOs, CSOs and various community groups are uniquely positioned to support counseling, testing and treatment for young persons who may be at risk for HIV. They have peer educators, innovative outreach services, drop-in centers, and various activities to engage the youth, which clinics are unable to provide. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the more prominent NGO-run clinics in the city include FPOP, which offers family planning, laboratory services and primary health care, ARV treatment and a transgender health service. Team Dugong Bughaw (TDB) has the “Yuhum” (Smile) Community Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both TDB and FPOP provide HIV screening and counseling, and PrEP. They have volunteers and facilitators whom young people can relate to, and run open, welcoming spaces where young people can feel more safe, confident and comfortable, enabling them to discuss concerns around sexual health and rights, including mental health issues. Contrast this with a room in a crowded hospital corridor, where most HIV treatment facilities can be found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enabling-policy-environments-need-to-be-sustained-resources-for-implementation-are-lacking"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling policy environments need to be sustained; resources for implementation are lacking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, while the country has an enabling policy on HIV education in schools (through RA 11166, the HIV and AIDS Policy Act) and for Sexual and Reproductive Health education in (mandated by the 2012 RH law), both remain unevenly resourced and implemented.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a study done in an unnamed Philippine city, Kim et al found that “local stakeholders have different concepts of Reproductive Health (RH) and delivered their own perceived concept of RH; teachers lack RH pedagogy and training while they also tend to minimize and modify their teaching in fear of further stimulating student interest in sex.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RH law, though over a decade old, continues to be controversial and is perceived to be in conflict with Filipino social and cultural norms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a Department of Education order in September 2025, “&lt;a href="https://www.deped.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/DO_s2025_025r.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Policy on the Implementation of Reproductive Health Education for Adolescent learners in Basic Education&lt;/a&gt;,” Secretary Sonny Angara directed the department to “integrate basic and age-appropriate instruction on the causes, modes of transmission and ways of preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS and other STIs into the curricula of public and private learning institutions, including alternative and indigenous learning systems, in accordance with the HIV and AIDS Policy Act.” More specific implementing guidelines need to be developed, though.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So there are really quite complex reasons for our rising HIV rates — more testing means more cases, and better early detection and treatment, in the long run. Being ready to discuss sexuality, safer sexual behaviors, HIV prevention and transmission openly and in a non-judgmental way, reducing stigma, doing outreach, increasing condom use and PrEP, and strengthening reproductive health education for youth — in and out of school, could help in blunting the rise of HIV in the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need more open discussions with young people, especially young LGBTQ, to find out what they’re thinking, and what might be acceptable and effective interventions to reduce risk. We also need to work closely with non-government organizations, youth organizations, organizations working on sexual and reproductive health and rights.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need innovative ways of reaching young people who may be at extra risk for early sexual activity.  How do we make sure they see the prevention messages, recall and practice them, seek out services, and know their HIV status? How do we ensure they are comfortable going to clinics, meeting with health workers, peer educators/counselors, doing telehealth? How do we support people with HIV so that they continue to receive treatment, and not drop off the radar?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is one public health emergency that will be here for decades to come. &lt;strong&gt;– Rappler.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"With so few new drug candidates in the first place, we need a significant investment in antibiotic development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found a preponderance of Gram-negative bacteria causing infections in newborns at these hospitals. Due to the structure of their cell envelope, Gram-negative bacteria have an in-built resistance to some antibiotics, and are generally &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25061340"&gt;more likely to develop antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt; than Gram-positive species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="alignnone wp-image-177073 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction arises from their different responses to the Gram staining test, which is used to divide bacterial species into these two broad groups based on properties of their cell walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abundant Gram-negative bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter&lt;/em&gt; were responsible for nearly 80 percent of infections studied, the authors report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176832" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176832" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BacteriaFoundInBloodSamples.jpg" alt="Graph showing proportion of infections caused by different types of bacteria and fungi.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Microplastics are turning up just about everywhere in the global food supply, including in &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-in-seafood-study-8773102" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, cups of &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-in-tea-bags-study-8770478" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt;, and even in &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-detected-in-vegetable-tissue-university-of-plymouth-study-2025-11816039" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt; freshly plucked from the ground.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Italy’s University of Padua shared their findings after analyzing microplastics in dairy products, including milk, fresh cheese, and ripened cheese. The team examined 28 retail samples, including cartons of milk, 10 fresh cheeses aged less than one month, and 14 ripened cheeses aged more than four months. The researchers minimized cross-contamination risk by conducting their tests in a "Class 7 cleanroom" and using cleaned glassware, ensuring that any microplastics detected were present from the start.

Unsurprisingly, they found microplastic particles in 26 out of 28 products tested, most often identifying polyethylene terephthalate, also known as&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polyethylene-terephthalate#:~:text=Polyethylene%20terephthalate%20%28PET%29%20is%20a%20polymer%20produced%20through%20the%20polymerization,environmental%20impact%20of%20PET%20packaging." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; PET&lt;/a&gt;, a plastic commonly used in food packaging and plastic bottles, along with&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/polyethylene#:~:text=In%20subject%20area:%20Materials%20Science,How%20useful%20is%20this%20definition?" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; polyethylene&lt;/a&gt;, the most widely used plastic, and&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/polypropylene#:~:text=Polypropylene%20%28PP%29%20is%20a%20common,would%20occupy%20landfills%20during%20disposal." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; polypropylene&lt;/a&gt;, a thermoplastic polymer also frequently used in food packaging.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team found significantly more microplastics in cheese than in milk. Ripened cheese had the highest levels, about 1,857 particles per kilogram, followed by fresh cheese at 1,280 particles per kilogram, and milk with around 350 particles per kilogram. The researchers noted that the difference between cheese and milk was substantial enough to be considered meaningful. Their findings suggest the additional microplastics are likely introduced during processing, due to the additional steps involved in pressing, aging, and packaging cheese, including everything from feed bags to retail wrappers.

Using a mouse model, researchers observed that male mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 before mating produced offspring who exhibited higher levels of anxiety-like behaviours. These changes were linked to alterations in non-coding RNA in sperm, which play a key role in regulating gene expression. Female offspring also showed significant changes in gene activity in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for anxiety and mood regulation. The findings have been published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64473-0" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. While further studies are needed in humans, these results suggest the pandemic could have long-lasting effects on future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How COVID-19 affects sperm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that COVID-19 infection can alter various RNA molecules in sperm, including non-coding RNAs that regulate how genes are expressed. These RNAs act as molecular instructions, guiding offspring development and brain function. Changes in these molecules due to viral infection can potentially influence neurological development and behaviour in offspring. According to Professor Anthony Hannan, the study is the first to show that SARS-CoV-2 infection before conception can directly impact sperm in ways that affect the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evidence from mouse studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In controlled experiments, male mice were allowed to recover from COVID-19 for several weeks before mating with healthy females. The resulting offspring consistently displayed increased anxiety-like behaviours compared to offspring from uninfected fathers. Detailed analysis revealed significant gene activity changes in the hippocampus, the brain’s region responsible for regulating emotion, stress response, and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female offspring showed particularly strong alterations in genes linked to affective behaviours. First author Dr. Elizabeth Kleeman explained that these findings demonstrate how viral infections in males can indirectly shape brain development in their children. The research has been published in Nature Communications, emphasizing its contribution to epigenetic science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implications for future generations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study raises important questions about the long-term consequences of COVID-19 beyond those directly infected. Professor Hannan noted that if similar effects occur in humans, millions of children could be impacted worldwide, with potential implications for mental health and development. These findings underscore the importance of understanding COVID-19 not just as an acute illness but as a factor that may influence reproductive health and the well-being of future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of epigenetics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research highlights the concept of epigenetic inheritance, where environmental factors, including viral infections, can alter molecular information in sperm. Such changes can influence the next generation without altering the DNA sequence itself. Dr. Carolina Gubert, co-senior author, explained that modifications in sperm RNA can transmit instructions that shape brain development, stress response, and behavioural traits in offspring. This finding builds on previous knowledge that factors like diet and stress can have similar transgenerational effects, showing that COVID-19 may add another layer of influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;br&gt;Next steps in research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study provides compelling evidence in mice, further research is needed to understand if the same mechanisms occur in humans. Researchers aim to examine sperm from men who have recovered from COVID-19 and study any potential behavioural or neurological impacts on their children. Understanding these effects could help shape public health guidelines, reproductive advice, and early interventions to mitigate long-term consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 08:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgJBVV95cUxNZWZ5c3VRNjVEX3BFbjBEejRpZ05fUmwzSm42MC1ndXNucXBZSlduMzQtNDBqdjN3ZDkwczhHaUJOeUM5bUg4UlJWa29oUDFOak54ZmhXQV9MN2FpempOek1DbXBLVndZN3VXamFON1B0OHBQS1J4eWVrNHBlX2Q2Wk5DalgySk9jV3NTTDM3ejFxYVowMmRNNzVwV0tMUVgzUzhtWkZaMWJzTW5QRHdyTER0YW85d1FNUFJseGZzQTVMc3ZaT1FiVlI0VVp1LUdjenlVOHNQVS1ibFhudHZUbWJpNGFWZnozQmNWcy1WWlRzbkhvY0RZbTQwc2tZdkpQbE9yRWM3cE1HTURWa2FnU21TSXNmMzBpbWJ6ZFN0d0JKWndHd2c</guid></item><item><title>健身专家逆转整天坐着带来的伤害的4种方法-英国赫芬顿邮报</title><link>https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/how-to-reverse-sitting-harm_uk_68e8dba5e4b0972b775980dd</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might have heard that sitting all day “is the new smoking”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6187798/#sec6" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="American Journal of Public Health says" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68e8dba5e4b0972b775980dd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6187798/#sec6" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;American Journal of Public Health says&lt;/a&gt;, is an unfair comparison; they “are not comparable,” and the “misleading” line “may serve to distort and trivialise the ongoing and serious risks of smoking”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not, however, to say that staying inactive is good for us.

Dr. Sanjay Bhojraj, a US cardiologist with 20 years of experience, emphasises that how we move daily is more important than complex health fads or medicine cabinets. Let’s dig deeper…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why movement is the most powerful anti-ageing tool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bhojraj highlights that over 80% of chronic diseases are driven by lifestyle factors - how we move, eat, sleep, and manage stress. Among these, intentional movement is the “most powerful anti-ageing tool” we have. It does not mean intense workouts only; any movement that challenges your muscles and lungs teaches your cells to stay strong and alive. This sets the foundation for healthier ageing. He says, “How you move, eat, sleep, and manage stress determines far more about your longevity than what’s in your medicine cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Why are women more at risk for heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet… most people start at the pharmacy instead of with their physiology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How movement cuts disease risk by 50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Bhojraj, regular strength and aerobic exercises can lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline by up to half. This is huge because no medicine can come close to providing these benefits. The movement signals to the mitochondria in your cells - your energy engines to thrive on oxygen and sunlight, powering your longevity naturally. According to Dr Bhojraj, “Studies show consistent strength and aerobic training can lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline by up to 50%. No pill comes close to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Walking: A simple yet powerful step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need fancy equipment or a gym membership. Dr. Bhojraj points out that consistent daily walking can bring remarkable heart benefits. Walking 10,000 steps or even 20 to 30 minutes daily helps regulate blood pressure, improves circulation, and supports healthy heart rhythms. A study shows that walking daily can reduce heart disease risk by nearly 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Movement is key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movement is not just physical; it also lowers cortisol, the body’s main stress hormone. High cortisol harms the heart and brain. Regular movement eases stress, improving mood and cognitive function. Slower walking pace or lack of movement correlates with higher risks of depression, anxiety, and memory issues, while regular movement protects brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Movement is for everyone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bhojraj encourages integrating movement into daily life in any form—walking, yoga, swimming, or strength training. The message is clear: “To age well, start here, not at the pharmacy.” He further added, “That’s not a hack—it’s how your body was designed to heal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswJBVV95cUxPc1Z6ZVh6eU5UOFlZS0JGU0dfWmswcklxNnNTZUFibGM1TDRKV3E5Q1BjZzEwRE5UTHVYaEt1QzBicXNoOWlEZFo4aEx3SVh1d1NJRFlZSVJwYU9MMXhRWms5MUp6YzJMOWRDYTB4YmtTYjlEaE9RTDdWWnBKbWNwTEphMno2ZDc2QWR6SG1VelZQT2NsRjRQWWd4NVRQaktYUzRKZzd1RE40bFRmUW5RbFVGNzNPTXV5LWh1d0Y4RXdzWFVQZUdUTFp5Tnh6M1lSOUl3c25pTDM5NHNCS2FndG5YRkNZTjNuUE5PRzdieGtVRDcyRkhkOEY2NHFEeF9Ib0JJcG9Kc1RKbUNSR1ZHVnRfdnBmMWh1ZGloZWN6OVd6c2NkbFZ5eE9QVkdDTlpHOEdj</guid></item><item><title>更年期可能对您的眼睛产生的惊人影响- HuffPost UK</title><link>https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/menopause-dry-eyes_uk_68e7b0f2e4b0b4458cb736f2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might associate menopause with a few symptoms: hot flushes, disrupted sleep and changes to your libido, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/62-menopause-symptoms-explained_uk_6756fb9ee4b0a775f3921f26" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="other side effects" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68e7b0f2e4b0b4458cb736f2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6756fb9ee4b0a775f3921f26" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;other side effects&lt;/a&gt;, like a frozen shoulder, tinnitus, and a burning mouth, are lesser-known side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that’s because &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2023/apr/nine-ten-women-were-never-educated-about-menopause" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="more than 90% of women" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68e7b0f2e4b0b4458cb736f2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2023/apr/nine-ten-women-were-never-educated-about-menopause" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;more than 90% of women&lt;/a&gt;

– Over-the-counter eye drops can relieve dryness. Try different types to see what works best.

But a good one, a real one, can hold its own next to a burger or even a steak. The problem is, most of what ends up in grocery carts isn’t that. With summer cookouts around the corner, we looked at some of the most popular grocery brands and checked &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/what_is_a_hotdog_brand_you_dont_like/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:which ones get the most hate from shoppers on Reddit.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;which ones get the most hate from shoppers on Reddit.com&lt;/a&gt; — and why. Here are the six worst grocery store hot dogs, according to shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gwaltney Great Dogs Original&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwaltney claims these are &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gwaltney-Original-Chicken-Hot-Dogs-Bun-Size-3-lb/10452733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“America’s No. 1 chicken hot dog,”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;“America’s No. 1 chicken hot dog,”&lt;/a&gt; and their main selling point is that they have 40% less fat than regular beef hot dogs. They’re marketed as a lighter, affordable option, and you’ll usually find them at places like Walmart, Food Lion, and other big grocery chains for about $1.50 to $2 a pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you’re actually getting is a hot dog made mostly of mechanically separated chicken, with some pork, water, corn syrup, and generic “flavorings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re not big in the flavor department either — and judging by Reddit, people have some strong feelings about that. “They are absolutely horrific and the way they look in the frying pan is disturbing me to my core,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/1fujwa2/comment/lpzzhrr/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said one Redditor.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said one Redditor.&lt;/a&gt;“They’re the second worst hot dog I’ve ever had the displeasure of biting into and then promptly spitting into a napkin and throwing away,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/1fujwa2/comment/lpzx4t8/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adds another.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adds another.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;FUD Hot Dogs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll mostly find them at Walmart and select grocery stores, especially in areas with a large Hispanic customer base. They’re priced in the low-to-mid range, usually around $2.50 to $3 a pack, but you’re mostly paying for disappointment. These are made from mechanically separated chicken and pork, with salt, flavoring, and sodium lactate to round out the flavorless parade. Reddit users have roasted FUD consistently for years — many say they couldn’t even finish the pack. The texture is rubbery, the taste is bland and off-putting, and even boiling doesn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bar-S Classic and Beef Franks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bar-S is an ultra-budget brand owned by Sigma (yes, same as FUD), and it’s one of the top-selling hot dog brands in America, not because it’s good, but because it’s dirt cheap. You can find it everywhere from Walmart to Dollar General, usually under $1.50 per pack. It’s also one of the most hated hot dog brands out there. The classic franks are made with mechanically separated chicken and turkey, with a little pork thrown in and beef hearts for flair. Ingredients include corn syrup, sodium nitrite, and potassium lactate. On Reddit and Chowhound, they’re called “possessed,” “mushy,” “too sweet,” and “unsettling in texture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bar s dogs of all flavors are like eating marshmallow meat and they don’t get plump when you cook them”&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kg2waog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one Redditor said.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one Redditor said.&lt;/a&gt; “Mystery meat dogs at their worst.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oscar Mayer Classic Wieners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oscar Mayer proudly claims their hot dogs have “no fillers,” which feels a bit rich when you flip the package over and see what’s actually in them. The ingredient list starts with mechanically separated chicken and turkey, plus some pork, which translates to mystery meat and a long scroll of additives like sodium phosphate, sodium benzoate, and sodium nitrite. This isn’t exactly a clean label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find these just about everywhere — Target, Kroger, Safeway — for around $3.50 to $5 a pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do have a nostalgic fan base, but they are also wildly roasted on Reddit for being the “default bad hot dog.” ​​I sometimes think about buying Oscar Mayers hot dogs then I see them on the shelf and I look at their color and then always pass,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kg9k6hj/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one user sums it up.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one user sums it up.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ball Park Franks (Regular and Grillmaster)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ball Park is everywhere — Costco, CVS, your neighbor’s Fourth of July cookout. Owned by Tyson Foods, the brand has been around forever and sells a dizzying number of varieties. The regular franks are made from a blend of mechanically separated chicken and pork, corn syrup, and a long list of preservatives. They’re soft, overly sweet, and don’t grill particularly well. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kgglubl/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one Redditor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one Redditor&lt;/a&gt;. “They taste like what you imagine hot dog water tastes like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beef versions, especially the Grillmaster line, get noticeably more respect. They’re made with actual beef — no mystery meats — and they cook up with better texture and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jennie-O Turkey Franks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennie-O is known for turkey, but these franks don’t do the brand any favors. They show up in most grocery stores — Safeway, Meijer, Albertsons — for around $3 to $4 a pack, and they’re sold as the “healthier” option. But low fat doesn’t mean much when the end result is dry, dense, and painfully bland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ingredients aren’t great either — mechanically separated turkey, water, corn syrup, and not much else.

This is the type of stress you experience consistently, for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kaeberlein, it’s not uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people have chronic stress, and it’s really the chronic stress that is detrimental to your health,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-figure-out-if-you-have-chronic-stress" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-figure-out-if-you-have-chronic-stress"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to figure out if you have chronic stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="ea64ce5f-4bb9-4fb6-8ea0-c28207e9e25d"&gt;Knowing whether or not you have chronic stress is simply a matter of identifying whether or not you’re regularly stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need complicated devices. I think most people, if they are in touch with themselves, can tell if they are stressed or not,” Kaeberlein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling to identify your emotions, some devices can help you keep tabs on your stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a growing number of tools [and metrics] that we can use to estimate whether somebody is experiencing an unhealthy level of chronic stress. Heart rate variability is a good example,” Kaeberlein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="190a0464-bfcf-4614-9741-3626074089be"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images/ andreswd)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="7f91da29-251c-4d9f-b6d6-24c92ea477a0"&gt;Fitness trackers from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/apple" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Oura and Garmin offer heart rate variability tests. These aren’t 100% accurate, but they can show you trends in your heart rate variability and give you a general indication of stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a more sophisticated test, Kaeberlein recommends a device called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://trainwithmorpheus.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://trainwithmorpheus.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Morpheus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can measure it well, [heart rate variability] is actually a really powerful biomarker for understanding whether somebody is experiencing chronic stress at a level that is unhealthy for them,” says Kaeberlein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-two-ways-that-dr-matt-kaeberlein-reduced-his-stress-levels" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-two-ways-that-dr-matt-kaeberlein-reduced-his-stress-levels"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two ways that Dr Matt Kaeberlein reduced his stress levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="f15d2c6d-b820-4b6f-b259-d5498c1f1783"&gt;If you are experiencing stress, it's a good idea to speak to a healthcare professional. But there are also things you can do in your daily life to reduce stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anything that we can do to learn how to manage that stress will have a positive impact on our health going forward,” says Kaeberlein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaeberlein says there are two key things he's done to reduce his stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="90e4c41d-888e-4ea8-b375-b950ce3d9019"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images/ FG Trade Latin)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-exercise" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-exercise"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="4a956172-4724-4c8c-a98d-cf374bdb56b5"&gt;Regular exercise has lots of benefits, but many people don't realise it's also a great stress-buster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lifting weights is a great stress management tool,” says Kaeberlein, revealing that this is the main form of exercise he does. “I exercise regularly. That's something that I obviously believe is very important for health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-limit-social-media" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-limit-social-media"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Limit social media &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="9f93f325-1138-4c7e-9792-4d8cd30f3772"&gt;“In our daily lives, in the world that we live in today, we are overwhelmed with information and stimuli,” says Kaeberlein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's a variety of aspects to how social media can cause stress. One is how much negative information is on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The constant underlying negative feelings or negative information that you’re experiencing drives chronic release of hormones like cortisol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, Kaeberlein says that he tries to limit the amount he uses social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tend to stay off of social media, and I tend not to consume a lot of news right now,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

It could be because of how your brain is wired, and may be affecting your mental and physical health, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted by researchers in Canada and Singapore, using patient-reported sleep, health and lifestyle factors, as well as brain imaging, has identified five distinct sleep profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The research, published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003399&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;, found that each of the profiles showed unique patterns of brain network organization, and was linked to different mental and physical health traits.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1707-7437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Valeria Kebets&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, co-first author of this study, who is currently manager of machine learning projects at the Applied AI Institute, Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important finding of our study is that sleep is multi-dimensional, and some of the profiles show that specific aspects of sleep are related to mental health or cognitive performance in a distinct way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 770 healthy adults aged between 22 and 36 years of age from the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3724347/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;WU-Minn Human Connectome Project&lt;/a&gt; (HCP), a study investigating the relationship between human brain circuits and behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants filled in questionnaires about their lifestyle, mental and physical health, personality and objective measures of physical health and cognition. They also completed sleep health questionnaires to define different dimensions of sleep, including duration, satisfaction and disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the self-reported questionnaires, participants underwent &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146309" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&lt;/a&gt; scans to identify neural signatures of their sleep profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers outlined their objective, saying that: “[I]n this study, we sought to take a multidimensional data-driven approach to identify sleep-biopsychosocial profiles that simultaneously relate self-reported sleep patterns to biopsychosocial factors of health, cognition, and lifestyle in the [healthcare professional] cohort of healthy young adults. We further explored patterns of brain network organization associated with each profile to better understand their neurobiological underpinnings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified 5 profiles related to 118 biopsychosocial measures — spanning cognitive performance, physical and mental health, personality traits, affects, substance use, and demographics — as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile 1&lt;/strong&gt;: generally poor sleep, with decreased sleep satisfaction, longer time to fall asleep, more sleep disturbances, and daytime impairment. This was linked to &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323454" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, somatic complaints, internalizing behavior, fear, anger, and stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile 2&lt;/strong&gt;: higher complaints of daytime impairment without complaints of sleep difficulties, suggesting sleep resilience, linked to attentional problems, such as inattention, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323667" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, low conscientiousness, fear, anger and stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile 3&lt;/strong&gt;: mostly characterized by the use of sleep medication. This was linked to worse performance in visual episodic memory and emotional recognition, but also to satisfaction in social relationships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile 4&lt;/strong&gt;: insufficient duration of sleep (less than 6–7 hours per night), which was associated with worse accuracy and longer reaction time at multiple cognitive tasks, delayed reward discounting, language, fluid intelligence, and social cognition, as well as more aggressive behavior and lower agreeableness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile 5&lt;/strong&gt;: sleep disturbances, such as multiple awakenings, nocturia (waking frequently to urinate), and breathing issues, as well as pain or temperature imbalance. This group tended to show aggressive behavior, worse cognitive performance, anxiety, thought problems and internalisation, and substance abuse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kebets outlined the potential clinical significance of their findings, saying that: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The five profiles were found in a sample of healthy young adults that didn’t have a psychiatric diagnosis or disabilities, suggesting that they could be used as a marker for the development of future issues, and they can guide tailored interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each profile was associated with a unique brain-network organization, having distinct patterns of network connectivity within the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers emphasize that further research is needed to clarify the relationships between the sleep profiles and brain network connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found some patterns of brain connectivity that were specific to each profile, but overall we observed dysfunctional connectivity patterns in the brain networks that are responsible for motor and visual functions,” Kebets told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can you ensure that you get enough quality sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;exercise regularly — try to get 20-30 minutes of exercise a day, but do not engage in intense exercise too close to bedtime&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ensure that your mattress is comfortable and supportive — if it is old or not a good fit for you, this can lead to sleep issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;limit alcohol consumption at night — although it can make you fall asleep faster, it can disrupt your sleep patterns and increase waking, snoring, and even &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Heart Lung and Blood Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-apnea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;avoid large meals and beverages close to bedtime, as these can cause indigestion and a need to urinate, which will disturb sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;try to go to bed and wake up at around the same time each day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;make sure your bedroom is a comfortable environment for sleeping in — keeping it cool (60–70 degrees Fahrenheit) and dark will help your sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;take time to wind down before bedtime, by meditating, reading a book, taking a hot bath or shower, or listening to music.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“General advice would be to keep good sleep habits — e.g., limit using your phone in the hour before going to sleep, limit alcohol/drug use, and have a regular bed time.
