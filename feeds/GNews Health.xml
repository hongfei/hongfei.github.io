"Simple actions like staying home when you're sick and calling ahead before seeking medical care help protect others, especially during a busy time of year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah has reported 125 measles cases statewide this year, as of Dec. 16, which is the most cases in a year in &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51418140" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;more than three decades&lt;/a&gt;, according to state epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen. An updated statewide count is expected to be released Tuesday at 3 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of Utah's confirmed cases are found in southwestern Utah, according to the state's &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, with a growing number reported in counties in northern Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can remain airborne and on surfaces for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area. Symptoms often include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications of the disease can lead to blindness and death for those with compromised immune systems, young children and adults over the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of the disease, and say that herd immunity requires a 95% vaccination rate. About 90% of Utahns are vaccinated against measles, according to Nolen and Dorothy Adams, a Salt Lake County health expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 2,000 cases of measles have been confirmed nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the highest number since the disease was considered &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51409430" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help prevent the spread of measles, Utah County health officials urge Utahns to take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home when sick, especially if a fever or rash is present.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call ahead before seeking medical care if measles is suspected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

So much flu,” said Dr. Debra Langlois, a pediatrician at University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital in Ann Arbor. “We are inundated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d9ef6" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. John Schieffelin, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, is also seeing a surge in bad cases, particularly among kids who haven’t had their flu shots.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16ddc1" class="body-graf"&gt;“The kids who are vaccinated are doing just fine” recovering at home, Schieffelin said. “It’s the unvaccinated children that we’re seeing in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-4d01b8" class="body-heading"&gt;Flu symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c63cd4" class="body-graf"&gt;Langlois said she and her colleagues are seeing a fair amount of classic flu symptoms: fevers, body aches and extreme fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f022d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Anecdotally, Langlois said that she’s also seeing kids with severe headaches and dizziness. Her 7-year-old daughter had the flu last week and described the feeling like this: “I feel dizzy, like I’m spinning when I’m trying to walk.” Dehydration was the likely cause, Langlois said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-298284" class="body-graf"&gt;Some kids may also experience gastrointestinal issues like vomiting and diarrhea. But those symptoms could also arise because of a secondary virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4e851" class="body-graf"&gt;Children who have “persistent” fevers lasting two to three days, Langlois said, should be seen by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ed5d3f" class="body-heading"&gt;Is Tamiflu available?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-65e4f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Pharmacies say demand for the antiviral drug Tamiflu is also increasing. When given within the first 24 hours or so of flu symptoms, the drug has been shown to make people feel better about a day earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-507073" class="body-graf"&gt;A Walgreens spokesperson said the pharmacy chain is seeing “very high demand” for Tamiflu nationwide. The company recently saw its supply run low but has since ordered additional stock, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59dc08" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the Walgreens Respiratory Index — a weekly online tool that tracks the spread of respiratory illnesses — demand for over-the-counter at-home flu tests has jumped 61% nationwide over the last two weeks. In New York state, where flu activity is considered very high, according to the CDC, week over week demand is up 23%, while the two week increase stands at 111%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ccfc4" class="body-graf"&gt;Antonio Ciaccia, president of 3 Axis Advisory, a consulting firm focused on addressing supply chain issues, said he’s hearing from a number of independent pharmacies across the U.S. who say they’re struggling to meet demand for Tamiflu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6986a3" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are seeing an early heavy wave of flu cases, which is likely pushing a bit of unexpected pressure on the broader drug distribution channel and its supply,” Ciaccia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8566bb" class="body-graf"&gt;Steve Moore, who runs an independent pharmacy in Plattsburgh, New York, said his primary supplier is not experiencing shortages of Tamiflu. His backup supplier, however, is currently out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4b55a" class="body-graf"&gt;While Tamiflu can be helpful, Langlois said it’s no “miracle cure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-05cdca" class="body-graf"&gt;The antiviral is authorized for people 2 weeks and older, and is generally &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bad-flu-cdc-reports-us-high-high-flu-levels-rcna57849" target="_blank"&gt;most effective&lt;/a&gt; when given within the first 48 hours of flu symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aab29c" class="body-graf"&gt;“The thing to think about for Tamiflu is that it shortens the duration of symptoms by about a day,” Langlois said. “It’s really best reserved for high-risk patients, like patients with chronic lung disease, and young kiddos under age 2.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e6d25d" class="body-heading"&gt;If you're sick, stay home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e447bb" class="body-graf"&gt;“The best thing is prevention,” Langlois said, “and that’s getting your flu shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4cbbb2" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC recommends annual flu vaccines for everyone 6 months and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-550c9f" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors worry that kids who are sick with flu now could spread it to grandparents and other older adults over the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11c08f" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“At the risk of being a Grinch, if you have the flu and you actively have fevers, then you should stay home. Don’t go to family gatherings,” said Dr. Bernard Camins, medical director for infection prevention for Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. “People will understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:22:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOODA1cmhsbkpYcVZ4eWZWekI0VmR5SWZ1M2owTmVZUzl2TmNoMEdTWnI1TVIzQkQ1ZnlOS3JHN3BBcVR1Vk9BNGRTR01YYUp5ZVoydVl5d1kxcTViR1Q4Umx4aHlXU0hqX0xiN0dXRUpPZGQzZmtldmdJUTZlREFxUk92Zm9TRmlzZUZ3SWsydUVidWp2bmwyQTJTSkxtSUQwaFdKY2Y3RmprSndadnFjUmhvUnBfTFlnVnfSAVZBVV95cUxPNERRTjVQOG9qa1ZTb3RPdFM4Z2JRYWJnaXZKVmlycENsamFzWmk4ZjZ2LWIxLWQ5R1M4Nk9mUXN4cDBROXdfWnF4N0UwbUo5WkRRQy1tQQ</guid></item><item><title>诺如病毒须知：症状、传播等-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/22/well/norovirus-symptoms-precautions.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 21:44:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPb2tQMS04X2FMakRuWnM5VVBOajJfQ2FYUFlKV2NVQS1od1Rpdy03VjJ4elNlVTN2dnNmMmY4QUNTd1ZRaHhHZkRMellUeEFIWEJoWnFxNzNCZmZ4S1k5cUNmSmNZVklTOTZkaGF4a05WbEZmblcwMjRGSHhXRC1RMw</guid></item><item><title>赠送智能手表来监测心脏健康？心脏病专家称重- WTOP</title><link>https://wtop.com/health-fitness/2025/12/gifting-a-smart-watch-to-monitor-heart-health-cardiologist-weighs-in/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Smartwatches are great for noticing heart health trends, but a Maryland doctor says users need to understands the technology's limits and shortfalls and when a visit to your doctor may be needed. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;A smart watch may be under your Christmas tree this week. The nifty gadgets are advertised as a tool to help you stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But can smart watches be trusted to look out for your heart? A Maryland cardiologist said the tech can monitor heart rate variability, absolute heart rate and its trends as well as heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Smart watches are fantastic screening tools, but they are not diagnostic tools,” said Dr. Minhal Makshood, a cardiologist with MedStar Montgomery Medical Center. “Ultimately, they cannot substitute your physician.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The watches can screen for changes in heart patterns that don’t always present symptoms right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’re great for noticing trends,” she said. “And then bringing that data, if there’s any abnormality, to your doctor for clear diagnosis, because they are not ultimately, medical grade devices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some changes could warrant a visit to your doctor, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If your smart watch is telling you that at rest, your heart rate is increasing,” Makshood said. “If there is abnormal response to exercise, or even if it’s flagging irregular heart rhythm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The watches could make a great gift for people who have heart disease, high blood pressure or loved ones with risk factors for heart disease such as diabetes, high cholesterol or sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Those patients are at risk of developing things like atrial fibrillation,” she said. “That’s an abnormal heart rhythm that is pretty common and when untreated, can lead to blood clot formation and increased risk of stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the smart watches have some shortfalls. Makshood said certain data collected by the tech could be inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You need to understand caveats, like blood pressure assessment, oxygen saturation may not always be accurate,” she said. “You can get false alarms depending on motion, depending on skin contact during exercise, all these are sensitive to the changes that you see in your watch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when shopping for a smart watch, there are certain data points the devices measure that are more helpful than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If the watch specifically tells you your heart rate, heart rate trends, if it tells you about heart rate variability, response to sleep and exercise,” Makshood said. “And if it helps tracking the heart rhythm with a single lead ECG, which the Apple Watch allows. That is really useful information.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple Watch was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the detection of atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Vaccines are in more danger than ever before. Over the weekend, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nearly succeeded at shrinking down the childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Politico &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/20/rfk-kennedy-danish-vaccine-schedule-denmark-00701999"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Kennedy canceled a press conference set for Friday afternoon where he would have formally advised that parents follow the vaccine schedule implemented in Denmark—a system with several fewer vaccine recommendations. Experts have largely opposed the proposed change, noting that the two countries are vastly different from each other. RFK Jr. reportedly balked at the last second due to concerns the decision would face political and legal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A near miss&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. and his allies have been signaling this potential change for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the last meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in early December, Tracy Beth Høeg, acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), gave a presentation about Denmark’s vaccine schedule. Høeg and others have argued that the U.S. should consider adopting Denmark’s schedule. Denmark universally recommends childhood vaccines for &lt;a href="https://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Scheduler/ByCountry?SelectedCountryId=58&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=false&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=false"&gt;10 diseases&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the U.S. universally recommends vaccines for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html"&gt;16 diseases&lt;/a&gt; (that number was 17 until the recent ACIP-led change to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/we-are-doing-harm-rfk-jr-s-acip-guts-universal-hep-b-vaccination-at-birth-2000695747"&gt;revoke&lt;/a&gt; its recommendation for the hepatitis B vaccine).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after, President Donald Trump stated that he would push to change the U.S. vaccine schedule to match that of other “peer countries” and &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-begins-process-to-align-u-s-core-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-with-best-practices-from-peer-developed-countries/"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an executive order on December 5 to that effect. This set the stage for HHS last Thursday to announce a press conference for the next day, where RFK Jr. was expected to officially recommend the Danish vaccine schedule as an alternative for parents in the U.S. to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But it seems the administration grew cold feet mere hours after it announced the press conference. An anonymous senior HHS official told Politico that the HHS Office of the General Counsel deemed that the abrupt change would likely result in a successful lawsuit against the agency. A second official added that the decision would be “politically risky.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An HHS spokesperson told Gizmodo that any reasons for the press conference’s cancellation not provided by HHS are “pure speculation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A lack of reason&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be clear, Kennedy and others have never presented a reasonable case for such a sweeping change to the vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There is no credible evidence that the amount or timing of vaccines currently recommended in the U.S. poses a health risk to children—a reality &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/multiples.html#:~:text=Scientific%20data%20show,vaccines%20on%20time."&gt;still acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (for now). Some anti-vaccination proponents have also argued that specific ingredients commonly included in vaccines, such as aluminum, could be dangerous if given repeatedly, but the majority of studies have not found any such risk, including one &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; just this past summer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts have also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/19/denmark-vaccine-schedule-vs-us/"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that while Denmark does recommend fewer vaccines in general than the U.S., there are important reasons why this schedule isn’t easily transferable to the latter. For one, Denmark has a universal health care system that’s much more robust than the U.S.’s fragmented system. This includes improved screening for vaccine-preventable diseases like hepatitis B. Notably, the U.S. once tried to vaccinate only high-risk groups for hepatitis B but eventually switched to a universal system after cases failed to significantly decline; this approach then helped dramatically reduce new infections, particularly among newborns.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leaving that aside, plenty of other high-income countries are much closer to the U.S. in the number of vaccines they recommend to their residents, including &lt;a href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/182063328?r=1qy0gl&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true#:~:text=Canada%2C%20Australia%2C%20Germany%2C%20France%2C%20and%20Japan%20all%20have%20schedules%20covering%2014%2D16%20diseases"&gt;Canada, Germany, and Japan&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few. Some countries are also following the U.S.’s example and adding more vaccines to their schedule, such as the U.K., which will &lt;a href="https://www.gov.wales/routine-varicella-chickenpox-vaccination-young-children-1-january-2026-whc2025046-html#:~:text=The%20NHS%20in%20Wales%20will%20introduce%20a,One%20dose%20of%20MMRV%20at%20this%20appointment"&gt;introduce&lt;/a&gt; the chickenpox vaccine to its routine starting next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even health officials in Denmark are baffled by the attempt to use the country as justification for Kennedy’s trimming of the U.S. schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It’s not at all fair to say look at Denmark unless you can match the other characteristics of Denmark,” Anders Hviid, the lead researcher on vaccine safety and effectiveness at the Statens Serum Institut (Denmark’s equivalent to the CDC), &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/19/health/kennedy-childhood-vaccine-schedule-denmark.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the New York Times Friday. “It is surreal, and it is difficult, from a Danish perspective, to understand what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s certainly possible that some vaccines aren’t or will eventually not be worthwhile for children in the U.S. to routinely receive. But any changes should be carefully weighed and discussed by actual health experts and researchers, not abruptly implemented under the radar on a Friday afternoon by politicians who have a clear anti-vaccine bias like RFK Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while Kennedy may have been stymied this time, it’s almost certain that this won’t be his last such attempt.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Doctors and scientists say this year's influenza season could be tougher than usual. A new version of the flu virus, called H3N2, is spreading quickly. At the same time, fewer people are getting &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kids-flu-covid-shots-fall-2025-vaccine-guidance-shifts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;flu shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This flu season is no joke. We are seeing more cases than we would expect for this time of year," Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, said on "CBS Mornings." Specifically, she explained, "we are seeing influenza A, and within influenza A we are seeing a subtype or variant called H3N2."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's pretty likely to be an H3N2-dominated flu season," said Jesse Bloom, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who studies viral evolution. "I don't see any reason to think that this is an unprecedentedly bad one, but current indicators are that it may be substantially more severe than the typical winter flu season."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloom said the H3N2 virus has changed just enough to make it harder for people's immune systems to recognize, but a flu shot could still help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting the vaccine is something that people, particularly those who are in high-risk groups, can do," he explained. "It's not going to eliminate their chance of getting infected, but it does mitigate their risk."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A changing virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other experts share Bloom's concern. "I would say pretty worried," said Dr. Helen Chu, a flu expert at the University of Washington. "Based on the U.K. and Japan data, it's looking like it's causing a lot of cases of flu and hospitalizations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said flu activity "is starting everywhere right now," overlapping with RSV but coming before a likely winter COVID-19 wave. &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Early flu vaccine data from other countries&lt;/a&gt; show good protection at first, around 70% in children, but that may not last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Total season effectiveness is probably going to actually be much, much lower," Chu warned, because immunity fades over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trevor Bedford, who also studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, said H3N2 tends to evolve faster than other influenza strains. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I expect more H3 incidence than the typical year and poorer vaccine effectiveness," he said. These large "jumps" in how the virus appears to our immune system usually occur every three to four years, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/stephen-s-morse-phd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Stephen Morse&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University, noted that influenza's behavior still defies confident forecasting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many excellent scientists have come to grief trying to predict what influenza will do — consider 1976," he said, referring to a year with a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2686218/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;notorious scare&lt;/a&gt; over a swine flu outbreak that didn't end up spreading widely. He added that the emergence of the H3N2 K subclade was "one of those surprises," and while surveillance detected it quickly, "the bad news is that we weren't really prepared for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why that matters: H3N2 is known for causing tougher flu seasons, especially for seniors. The new strain has changed in ways that make it harder for the immune system to recognize, so more people may get sick and need hospital care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The flu vaccine still helps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with these changes, doctors say the annual flu shot is still the best protection available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The match to H1N1 and flu B is expected to be good," said Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. "Even though we are expecting a H3N2 mismatch, vaccine effectiveness doesn't always correlate with vaccine match. … Bottom line, still a good idea to get the vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early-season data from the U.K. suggest the flu vaccine is still helping prevent severe illness, especially in children, even with the H3N2 mismatch. Protection in adults appears more modest and is expected to decline over time. Experts stress that flu vaccines are designed mainly to reduce severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths — not necessarily to prevent every infection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gregory Gray, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Texas Medical Branch, added that people who work with animals should also be vaccinated. "Persons working with cattle, poultry, and pigs should receive their annual influenza vaccine," he said. That helps stop human viruses from mixing with animal ones and creating new strains that could be dangerous to both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morse also underscored the value of vaccination despite the virus's unpredictability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I still advocate the annual influenza vaccine… It's still a good precaution," he said, pointing out that flu shots help protect against multiple circulating viruses, not just H3N2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flu symptoms to watch for, and what you can do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates there have been 4.6 million flu cases across the U.S. since this season began, and 1,900 patients have died from it, including at least three children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are tons of these cases throughout the country, and it's causing a very, very severe flu," Kravitz said. "Symptoms that are very intense, they come on really, really rapidly. It's very contagious, so it is spreading quickly through communities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu is often accompanied by "high, high fevers, like 103, 104 degrees Fahrenheit," as well as body aches and cough, Kravitz said. In addition, she added, "we see vomiting in children this year, specifically with this variant of the flu."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advised parents to help keep their child hydrated, and "if the symptoms last a long time, more than four or five days, especially that high fever, it's a good idea to call their pediatrician."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say there's no need to panic, but it's important to prepare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get your vaccine," Chu said. "It's still not too late." The shot helps protect against severe illness and may even give "some cross protection against H5N1 as well," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors also stress the importance of early testing and treatment. Antiviral medications like Tamiflu and Xofluza still work against the flu strains circulating this season, including H3N2, but they work best when started within the first couple of days of symptoms — especially for older adults, young children, pregnant people, and those with chronic health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray said the country needs better flu testing and more vaccines for humans and livestock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webby summed it up simply: "It's more of the same: vaccination, hygiene, and keeping an eye out for anything unusual."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bird flu still rare, but worth watching&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first human case of a bird flu strain, H5N5, was recently reported &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/washington-resident-dies-rare-bird-flu-strain/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;in Washington state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It has not spread to others, but scientists are watching closely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk to the general public from the H5N1 virus is still very low," Webby said. "But an H5 pandemic could easily make the COVID-19 pandemic look like a cake walk."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc6" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",6]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chu said fall bird migrations make this the time of year when cases in birds, and sometimes in people, tend to rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the time of year when we see the H5 cases," she said. "But a lot of the surveillance programs have been defunded, so in Washington state, there's not been as much as in years past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morse warned that gaps in surveillance, especially in agriculture, leave room for dangerous blind spots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance is still crucial. It needs to be sustained. … Agriculture especially has to do much more," he said, noting that past outbreaks in pigs and cattle were missed until they were well underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say avian flu remains a low risk for most people right now, but it is a low-probability, high-impact threat that requires close monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

They were believed to be alongside his uncle somewhere under the &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/a27633796/notre-dame-restoration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris&lt;/a&gt;, but when archaeologists went looking in 1758, the poet (or what was left of him) was nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then came another mystery. In 2022, archaeologists discovered an unmarked body under the famous cathedral and nicknamed it “The Horseman,” because the deceased’s bone structure showed he had ridden horses from a young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, experts believe the body is one answer to &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; mysteries, identifying The Horseman as du Bellay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The French National Institute of Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) &lt;a href="https://www.inrap.fr/archeologie-de-notre-dame-de-paris-avancees-des-recherches-19536" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:announced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in a translated statement the discovery after more than two years of uncertainty surrounding the unidentified remains. The mystery all started with the &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a27153194/notre-dame-cathedral-fire/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:April 2019 fire at Notre Dame;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;April 2019 fire at Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;. As INRAP began to work on &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a33298872/notre-dame-fire-collapsed-spire-reconstruction/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the restoration of the cathedral;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the restoration of the cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, archaeologists discovered 100 unknown burials under Notre Dame. With thousands of people, typically church-goers, buried in what was &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/a31081400/human-leg-bone-wall/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a necropolis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a necropolis&lt;/a&gt; between the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, Notre Dame stands apart from other Catholic burial grounds because the cathedral is largely built atop the cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finding 100 sets of unidentified remains wasn’t all that surprising. But two stood out. Discovered in April 2022, they had been placed in lead &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a61678257/2000-year-old-sarcophagus-unsealed/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sarcophagi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sarcophagi&lt;/a&gt;—rather than the usual wooden coffins—and buried at the cathedral’s transept crossing, a prominent spot where its main wings intersect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the lead coffins didn’t provide much mystery, with a plaque epitaph labeling it as that of priest Antoine de la Porte, who died in 1710 after 50 years of service at Notre Dame. The other, though, sparked the two-year search for The Horseman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A forensic team from Toulouse University Hospital studied the remains, and according to Eric Crubezy—a biological anthropology professor and research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research—the anonymous individual died in his 30s from chronic tuberculous meningitis in the 16th century. That age was unusual for burials at Notre Dame, which typically held elderly men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even more intriguing: Aside from Antoine de la Porte, archaeologists didn’t find any other intact tombs in the area. “Research suggests that they may have reoccupied a grave that had housed two people well known in their time,” Crubezy said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers turned their focus toward du Bellay: horseback rider, tuberculosis sufferer, and poet who died in 1560. While he was believed to be buried in the cathedral, his tomb wasn’t found in 1758 near his uncle, even though the family wanted him to be buried by his side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, was du Balley The Horseman? “He matches all the criteria of the portrait,” Crubezy said at a news conference, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finternational.la-croix.com%2Fculture%2Fhave-archaeologists-found-poet-joachim-du-bellays-remains-at-notre-dame-cathedral&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Farchaeology%2Fa69838803%2Fnotre-dame-the-horseman-body-mystery-solved%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;La Croix&lt;/em&gt;. “He is an accomplished horseman, suffers from both conditions mentioned in some of his poems, like in ‘La Complainte du desespere,’ where he describes ‘this storm that blurs [his] mind,’ and his family belonged to the royal court and the pope’s close entourage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But there’s still a wrinkle to the mystery. Christophe Besnier, an INRAP archaeologist, said at the same press conference that the man buried likely grew up in Paris or Lyon thanks to an isotope analysis of teeth and bones. Balley was likely born in Anjou in western France and later moved to Paris, dying in 1560 around the age of 35. That would make The Horseman and du Balley a tough match.

When you prioritize activities that spark a natural dopamine release, you aren't just waking up — you're essentially giving your brain a head start on feeling motivated and balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical released by brain cells, and it's mostly involved in motivation, learning and reinforcement," says &lt;a href="https://www.miasoviero.com/about" target="_blank"&gt;Mia Soviero&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscience researcher who conducted research at&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;NYU Langone Health and Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It isn't just about feeling good. It's mostly about learning and motivating you. So, it helps our brain understand what actions are worth repeating and what habits we should have in our lives that we should strengthen," says Soviero, who also founded the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.miasoviero.com/entrepreneurship" target="_blank"&gt;Research Girl, Inc&lt;/a&gt; to help aspiring science researchers receive more opportunities in their field of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common misconception is that dopamine levels are always supposed to be boosted, Soviero says: Neurotransmitter levels are meant to fluctuate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want to always have really high dopamine levels, but we do want to have a healthy dopamine system," she says. "You just want to build these good patterns in dopamine, where dopamine is able to be released the way it's supposed to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how Soviero structures her mornings to keep her dopamine system healthy, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-styles-makeit-subtitle--JP3GH"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A neuroscience researcher's dopamine-boosting morning routine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Exposure to sunlight&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soviero's ideal morning routine for the best mood starts the night before: &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/15/3-habits-to-improve-your-quality-of-sleep.html"&gt;Getting adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt; sets the tone for the next day, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, "I make sure that when I wake up, I get exposure to some light in the morning," she says. "Opening your curtains in the morning and getting sunlight on your face for a few minutes have actually been scientifically proven to reduce depressive symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/shining-a-light-on-winter-depression" target="_blank"&gt;especially if you have seasonal depression&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunlight exposure directly affects the area of your brain that controls your body's internal clock, or your circadian rhythm, according to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/shining-a-light-on-winter-depression" target="_blank"&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting enough exposure to sunlight each day "can cause your brain to produce too much of the sleep hormone melatonin and to release less serotonin, the feel-good brain chemical that affects mood. The result of this chemical imbalance? You feel low and lethargic," the health blog states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Sudoku&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soviero makes time in her mornings to do "small, meaningful activities" like completing a daily Sudoku puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a great way to kick off the day with a little dopamine from doing a puzzle. It's that feel-good chemical from achieving [it]," she says. "Novelty and new things that you aren't expecting that are good can increase dopamine levels in the brain and contribute to dopamine health. So that's why puzzles are great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solving crossword puzzles and physical puzzles can have the same effects on your brain, Soviero says: &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine" target="_blank"&gt;The brain has a reward system that boosts dopamine&lt;/a&gt; when "something unexpectedly good happens, and then decreases when something worse than expected happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This means that evolutionarily, we would strive for goals in the hopes that we'd get this feel good chemical as a reward," she says. "So when you do something, [like] learning a new skill, and you're surprisingly good at it, you get this influx of dopamine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Text a friend&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each morning, Soviero practices a simple and significant form of social connection: texting a friend. "I'll send a text to my friends [like], 'Hey, good morning. How are you doing today?'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Humans are biologically wired for connections," Soviero adds. "When you get to make that human connection, it's scientifically proven to boost your mood because that's what we're supposed to be doing." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending too much time without interacting with close loved ones like friends and family can harm your health, she says. Being socially isolated and feeling lonely can increase a person's risk of developing heart disease, dementia, depression and other chronic conditions, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/social-connectedness/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecting with others is "really healthy, not only for your brain but also for your body," Soviero says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?&lt;/strong&gt; Sign up for CNBC's new online course, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-raise-financially-smart-kids?utm_source=cnbc&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=makeitarticle&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=bottom" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Raise Financially Smart Kids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

A few years earlier, at the age of 34, soon after he and his wife had had their third child, Adam was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. I saw the story as a way to write about how people with fatal diagnoses navigate decisions on how to spend their remaining time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam died over the weekend, at 43. He and his family — his wife Whitney, and their three sons, Isaac, Noah, and Gideon, now 14, 12, and 10 — lived with his illness for nine years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam and Whitney had always been clear-eyed about the future and the ultimate course of his disease. So when he &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/9hbg2-help-for-the-haydens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;entered hospice care at home&lt;/a&gt; in the Indianapolis suburbs last month, I proposed writing another story about him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be illuminating to hear what he had learned about medicine through years of being a patient — where the system was built well, and where it fell short. I was interested not only in his experience of facing the kind of daily grind that comes with a cancer diagnosis, but the familial and financial challenges as well. But there was a selfish reason for my interest, too. Adam and I had kept in touch over the years, catching up every few months. I liked talking to him, and wanted to have more conversations with him. I knew I’d also get to talk more with Whitney, who is a riot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam was thoughtful, warm, and curious, a guy whose kindergarten teacher had once told his parents he had “a very gentle psyche.” He was also very public about his own journey as a patient. He &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/02/27/expert-patients-cancer-compensation/"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; compelling &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/02/long-term-survivors-can-help-map-cancer-boundaries/"&gt;op-eds&lt;/a&gt;, including for &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/26/john-mccain-glioblastoma-advice/"&gt;STAT&lt;/a&gt;, about his experience with cancer. He had trained as a philosopher and had dreams of becoming an academic. He didn’t need an outside writer to invoke the sword of Damocles that had been looming over him all these years. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Adam seemed excited about another story. (“I’ll always yap,” he said.) And Adam, who had devoted himself to advocacy on behalf of people with brain tumors and who confronted his disease with an openness and vulnerability that made people feel so connected to him, knew that dying was a part of this condition. He wanted to be upfront about that as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve taken a bad situation and done good things with it,” he told me. “That’s the most enduring thing I’ve been feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was on Nov. 20. He had just had his first appointment with the home health aide as part of his hospice care. It was nice to have more help at the house so Whitney had to bear less of it, he said. His beard had recently been bordering on biblical proportions, so the aide had given him a beard wash. That was nice, too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Adam admitted that, even though he had thought about the end for so long and prepared for it, getting to this point was surreal. It felt like his body was giving out faster than his mind was, or was ready for. He had been losing more motor control on one side of his body, and it was difficult and frustrating to try to type with one hand at a time when he had so much he wanted to get out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a lot of adjustment in a hurry,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That sword, he added, had dropped.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam and I had planned to keep chatting for the follow-up story, but soon after we spoke that day in November, his condition started deteriorating. A series of seizures left him confused, less able to speak, and in need of more sleep. We weren’t able to talk again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2016, but he outlived the reclassification of his disease. He had what’s known as an IDH mutation in his tumor, and these IDH-positive cancers&lt;a href="https://braintumor.org/news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-updates-to-brain-tumor-classifications-and-grades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; were separated out from glioblastomas in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, becoming what are known as grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas. People with these types of mutations generally live longer than those with glioblastomas without them, which helps explain why Adam blew past the median survival period for glioblastoma by years, even if his fate was always going to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was grateful for those extra years — a stretch of time spent with his family and his writing and his friends. It was more time for simple things that he felt lucky to witness, like walking his boys to the bus stop in the morning, even if his oldest started calling him “Boomer” when he turned 40. When he had a bad day — like when he had to spend hours recovering from a seizure — he tried to remember that other patients and their families’ wished they had been around for more bad days. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam had started being public about his illness early on. In countless social media posts, &lt;a href="https://glioblastology.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@adam__marc?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;TikToks&lt;/a&gt;, he provided updates, pulled back the curtain on the daily experience of living with cancer, and embodied the empathy that he so deeply felt that people should extend to others. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Hey fam,” he would often say at the start of his videos, as if he were about to unveil a new pair of sneakers instead of providing news on the disease that was killing him. And even as the updates grew more serious in recent years, as he faced recurrences, he maintained his lightheartedness. “We don’t know what we’re seeing!” he said one day about a potentially worrying scan, only then to start laughing, a bashful chuckle that evoked an “aw shucks” attitude.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, living so long with a terminal illness — and the costs and stresses that come with it — was exhausting. Through his work in the brain tumor community, he got to know many fellow patients, and then watched as they died. Every few months, he had another brain scan, and knew that one would inevitably be bad news. “Scanxiety” was a term in the cancer world for a reason. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m an energetic and positive guy, but sometimes you just have to say, ‘man, it’s just tough, it’s just tough,”’ he said &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@adam__marc/video/7413369269381008670?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; as he grew emotional talking about the roller coaster of undergoing chemotherapy once again, one of the few times I saw him allow himself to publicly display the weight of his struggles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Adam started hospice care, it was the first time in nearly a decade that he didn’t have a scan booked in his calendar. It was a relief, he said, even if it only came because there was no point anymore in surveilling his tumors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam and Whitney had always maintained, in seemingly unimaginable ways, their humor around his illness. In recent weeks, they found ways to laugh with the boys about his nascent incontinence. And hospice seemed like the perfect excuse to throw on “The Big Lebowski” and drink White Russians — who cares if it was 10 a.m.?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like I said, Adam didn’t need an outside writer to try to put a frame around his situation or to spell out what he was facing. He was more than capable of that. So I’ll end with Adam’s words, which Whitney said were some of his last when he was still conscious. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just want everyone to be kind to each other.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

And outpatient visits to healthcare providers for flu-like illness reached 4.9 percent, up from 2.8 percent the previous week, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting"&gt;the state’s weekly flu dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm"&gt;Levels of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/respiratory-illness-reporting" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/respiratory-illness-reporting"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and across the country remain low. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Larry Madoff, medical director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences, said flu activity for the general population is rising as expected for this time of year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Every flu season is different, but this is typically when we start to see an increase in influenza activity,” Madoff said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The surge in pediatric emergency visits comes as influenza A continues to dominate nationally. Public health officials are closely monitoring a newer flu strain known as &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/18/metro/new-flu-strain-massachusetts-subclade-k/#bgmp-comments" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/18/metro/new-flu-strain-massachusetts-subclade-k/#bgmp-comments"&gt;subclade K&lt;/a&gt;, a subvariant of the H3N2 subtype of influenza A that has drawn attention for driving an earlier-than-usual spike in flu cases &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/17-12-2025-more-than-half-of-who-european-region-experiencing-intense--early-influenza-season-driven-by-new-strain" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/17-12-2025-more-than-half-of-who-european-region-experiencing-intense--early-influenza-season-driven-by-new-strain"&gt;in the UK and several other countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Madoff said it is still too early to confirm how widespread subclade K is in Massachusetts because there is not yet enough sequencing data from state laboratories. However, most flu cases identified in Massachusetts so far this season are H3N2, and nationally, about 70 to 80 percent of sequenced H3N2 samples belong to subclade K.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We fully expect that those will be part of that subclade,” Madoff said, adding that more detailed state data is expected soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Clinicians emphasized that specific subclades do not change how patients are treated in emergency settings. Hospitals typically test only for influenza A or B, not for subtypes or subclades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Clinically, it doesn’t change anything I do,” Cohen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Doctors say children arriving in emergency departments this season are often experiencing high fevers — frequently 103 degrees or higher — along with headaches, body aches, congestion, coughing, and fatigue. Teenagers and older adolescents often present with intense achiness and exhaustion, while younger children are more likely to struggle with respiratory symptoms, clinicians said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Despite the sudden increase in emergency visits for influenza, clinicians say the surge appears to be driven by the number of children getting sick rather than a clear increase in severity. Dehydration and breathing difficulties remain the most concerning symptoms, particularly for infants and children with underlying health conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Public health officials are also watching flu vaccination rates, which lag behind recent years. About one in three Massachusetts residents has received a flu shot this season, according to Madoff — lower than health officials would like to see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Doctors say vaccination can make a significant difference even when it does not prevent infection entirely, reducing the likelihood that children will need emergency care or hospitalization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s not too late to get vaccinated,” Madoff said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Madoff and Cohen say mixed messaging around vaccines may be contributing to lower uptake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“When you have national bodies questioning the utility and efficacy of vaccines, people who are on the borderline are going to choose not to get them,” said Madoff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Cohen said he is seeing the effects firsthand, with there being fewer vaccinated children in the emergency department.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think there’s probably vaccine fatigue,” said Cohen. “There are just so many vaccines out there, and especially with COVID, a lot of people feel like they’re over it. But we know the flu kills every year. We know the best protection out there is the flu vaccine.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As cases rise, clinicians are urging families to focus on supportive care at home when appropriate — and to know when emergency care is truly needed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;McCoy also cautioned that emergency departments have been busy in recent days, with long wait times reported across the state. She urged families to seek emergency care for serious symptoms such as breathing difficulties or dehydration, but to consider urgent care or their pediatrician for milder illness when possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For children, she recommends frequent, small amounts of fluids to prevent dehydration, including electrolyte drinks, along with saline nasal spray and weight-based acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever and body aches. Honey can help soothe coughs in children over 1  year old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;By contrast, over-the-counter decongestants, combination cold formulas, and cough suppressants provide little benefit for young children and can cause side effects such as jitteriness, sleep problems, increased heart rate, or stomach upset, McCoy said. She said antibiotics do not treat viral infections like the flu and should only be used for confirmed bacterial infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Prescription antiviral medications such as Tamiflu may be helpful for certain patients — particularly young children and those with underlying health conditions. These medications do not cure the flu but can reduce the risk of complications and be especially beneficial for those with underlying health conditions. They should be taken in addition to the vaccination, according to McCoy and Madoff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Families should seek emergency care if a child has difficulty breathing, signs of dehydration, confusion or lethargy, bluish lips or face, or persistent vomiting that prevents fluids. Children with milder symptoms who are drinking fluids and breathing comfortably can often be cared for at home or seen by a pediatrician or urgent care provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As flu season continues, doctors say the message is one of awareness rather than alarm: get vaccinated, stay home when sick, and seek care when warning signs appear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consuming olive oil may reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and osteoporosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Olive oil provides healthy fats, polyphenols and vitamins E and K to support a healthy diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use olive oil on salads, roasted veggies, grains and pastas, or in baked goods and lattes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Olive oil is one of the most common cooking oils worldwide. It is cherished for its rich flavor and impressive health benefits. Made by harvesting olives, crushing them into a paste, and then pressing the paste to extract the oil, this golden liquid offers a rich, velvety taste that can elevate a wide variety of dishes. It also offers a surprising boost of antioxidants and plant compounds that may support overall health in various ways. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "[Olive oil contains plant compounds which] include oleic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid and steric acid,” says &lt;a href="https://mandyenright.com/meet-mandy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mandy Enright, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and worksite wellness specialist. “There are also phenolic compounds that include phytosterols, tocopherols, lignans and flavonoids.“

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cultures around the world include olive oil in their diets every day, and data have shown that many people of these cultures reap impressive benefits thanks to the simple addition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re considering adding olive oil to your daily routine, you may experience some noteworthy benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One notable health benefit of olive oil is its high content of monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, which have been linked to a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases. These healthy fats help reduce inflammation and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fats-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8553423" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;may positively influence blood cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, supporting your heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The PREDIMED (&lt;em&gt;Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea&lt;/em&gt;) study was a landmark clinical trial highlighting the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291120/mediterranean-diet-for-beginners-everything-you-need-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits of the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on heart health. Conducted in Spain, the study examined the effects of a Mediterranean diet enriched with either extra-virgin olive oil or nuts on individuals at high cardiovascular risk. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of major cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke, among participants who consumed a diet that contained extra-virgin olive oil. Note that the results also suggested a positive effect when people included nuts in their diet. While the PREDIMED diet is an older study from 2018, it remains a landmark study worth mentioning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other data suggests a similar link between following the Mediterranean diet, which features olive oil, and heart-health benefits. One specific study showed it may help decrease the progression of atherosclerosis, the buildup of fats and other substances in your artery walls, blocking appropriate blood flow.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Consuming olive oil may positively impact your bone health. Olive oil contains polyphenols—antioxidant compounds that research has found may promote bone formation and reduce the risk of bone loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These effects are particularly beneficial for someone with a risk of osteoporosis, a condition characterized by fragile and brittle bones.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation is a natural response of your body when something is going wrong. However, low-grade, long-term inflammation, known as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, increases the risk of diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, allergies and some types of cancer, to name a few. Research has shown that different components of olive oil—oleocanthal, oleacein, oleic acid and oleuropein—may help tame inflammation by reducing levels of different inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;monounsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; and antioxidants like vitamin E and polyphenols, olive oil may help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, which are linked to neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research has found that olive oil may be associated with cognitive benefits and a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, olive oil may reduce the risk of fatal dementia. One study, where researchers examined data from over 90,000 Americans, found that those who consumed more than half a tablespoon of olive oil each day had a 28% lower risk of dying from dementia compared to those who never or rarely consumed olive oil. The research also suggested that substituting 1 teaspoon of margarine or mayonnaise with olive oil daily was linked to an 8% to 14% reduction in the risk of dying from dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Olive oil may help to protect the lubrication of joints and protect against osteoarthritis due to its anti-inflammatory properties that include monounsaturated fats (in the form of oleic acid) and antioxidants, including tocopherols and phenolic compounds,” says Enright. “These properties may also lead to a decrease in CRP, a key marker of inflammation." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Enright notes that most of the studies that have looked at the role of olive oil in joint health are studies that have been conducted in mice and rats, so we need more high-quality studies to confirm this link.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With that said, some studies have used extracts of olive oil, pulling out the beneficial plant compounds so they're more concentrated; they show promise in pain management and function in people with knee osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Olive oil’s phytochemicals might help reduce the formation of cancerous tumors&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;According to a review, high consumption of olive oil may reduce the risk of cancer by up to 31%. Research has found the most significant protective effects for breast, overall gastrointestinal, upper aerodigestive and urinary tract cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, other studies have attributed these anticancer effects to the component oleacein, among other bioactive compounds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These exciting advancements in cancer research are ones to watch, especially when they point to food as medicine.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drizzle over salads:&lt;/strong&gt; Adding olive oil to salads enhances both flavor and nutritional value. Rich in monounsaturated fats, olive oil helps increase the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins from leafy greens and vegetables. Try our&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8049438/italian-dressing/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Italian Salad Dressing&lt;/a&gt; for a salad addition with a burst of olive oil–based flavor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use in cooking:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-cooking-with-olive-oil-destroy-its-nutrients-11713551" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Cooking with olive oil&lt;/a&gt; is a heart-healthy way to prepare meals. Olive oil can withstand medium-heat cooking methods, such as sautéing. Its flavorful profile enhances the taste of dishes, reducing the need for additional salt or butter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dip some bread:&lt;/strong&gt; Using olive oil as a dip for bread is a tasty choice that adds healthy fats to your carb source. It provides a savory alternative to butter or cream-based spreads, reducing saturated fat intake. Paired with herbs, olive oil can be a gourmet addition to any meal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add to your latte:&lt;/strong&gt; Starbucks was onto something when they&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030903/starbucks-olive-oil-coffee-drinks-what-to-know/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; launched their olive oil-infused lattes&lt;/a&gt;. Adding olive oil to a coffee drink served either hot or iced is an easy way to start your day with a boost of antioxidant goodness.

&lt;p&gt;Enright states that olive oil should be stored in a cool, dry place away from light and heat. She also recommends never leaving olive oil uncovered for long periods and tightly capping it between uses. When olive oil comes into contact with oxygen, it undergoes a chemical reaction known as lipid oxidation, which degrades the oil and results in rancidity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “You should also be mindful if you have been keeping a half-empty bottle of olive oil around for a long time, as the buildup of oxygen in the bottle isn’t ideal either,” adds Enright. For this reason, it's important to use the olive oil regularly and replace older bottles after a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new study, Northwestern scientists identified a previously unknown highly toxic sub-species of amyloid beta oligomers -- toxic clusters of peptides -- that appear to drive several of the brain's earliest changes, including neuronal dysfunction, inflammation and activation of immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experimental drug, a small-molecule compound called NU-9, decreased this toxic amyloid beta oligomersubtype and dramatically reduced the damage it causes in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. By addressing these changes at the onset of Alzheimer's disease, the researchers are hopeful NU-9 potentially could prevent, or significantly delay, the cascade of toxic events that ultimately destroy neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings point to a potential new strategy for targeting the disease in its earliest stages -- before cognitive decline and other debilitating symptoms take hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study will be published on Dec. 18 in Alzheimer's and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's disease begins decades before its symptoms appear, with early events like toxic amyloid beta oligomers accumulating inside neurons and glial cells becoming reactive long before memory loss is apparent," said Northwestern's Daniel Kranz, the study's first author. "By the time symptoms emerge, the underlying pathology is already advanced. This is likely a major reason many clinical trials have failed. They start far too late. In our study, we administered NU-9 before symptom onset, modeling this early, pre-symptomatic window."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kranz is a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences (IBiS) program at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, where he is advised by corresponding author William Klein. An expert on Alzheimer's disease, Klein is a professor of neurobiology at Weinberg and a cofounder of Acumen Pharmaceuticals, which has developed a therapeutic monoclonal antibody currently in clinical trials that targets the subtype of amyloid beta oligomers identified in the study. Richard Silverman, a key co-author of the study, invented NU-9. Silverman, who previously invented pregabalin (Lyrica) to treat fibromyalgia, nerve pain and epilepsy, is the Patrick G. Ryan/Aon Professor in Weinberg's Department of Chemistry and founder of Akava Therapeutics, a startup company commercializing NU-9 (now called AKV9).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The promise of NU-9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceived about 15 years ago, NU-9 emerged as part of Silverman's multi-year effort to discover a small molecule compound that could prevent toxic protein aggregate buildup in neurodegenerative diseases. By 2021, NU-9 demonstrated efficacy in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), clearing toxic SOD1 and TDP-43 proteins and restoring health to upper motor neurons. In 2024, it received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin human clinical trials for ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Silverman, Klein and Kranz demonstrated that NU-9 also could effectively treat Alzheimer's disease. In the previous study, NU-9 showed it could clear toxic amyloid beta oligomers in lab-grown brain cells from the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In both ALS and Alzheimer's disease, cells suffer from toxic protein buildup," Klein said. "Cells have a mechanism to get rid of these proteins, but it gets damaged in degenerative diseases like ALS and Alzheimer's. NU-9 is rescuing the pathway that saves the cell."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early intervention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further investigate the drug's potential in treating Alzheimer's disease, the team wanted to evaluate its effectiveness at halting the earliest damage. In the new study, the researchers administered NU-9 to a pre-symptomatic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The mice received a daily oral dose for 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. NU-9 significantly reduced early reactive astrogliosis, an inflammatory reaction that typically begins long before symptoms appear. The number of toxic amyloid beta oligomers bound to astrocytes (star-shaped brain cells that protect neurons and control inflammation) also plummeted. And an abnormal form of the protein TDP-43 -- a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases that is linked to cognitive impairments -- sharply decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results are stunning," Klein said. "NU-9 had an outstanding effect on reactive astrogliosis, which is the essence of neuroinflammation and linked to the early stage of the disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvements spanned multiple regions of the brain, indicating that NU-9 has a brain-wide anti-inflammatory effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A hidden culprit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While investigating the effects of NU-9 on the pre-symptomatic mouse model, the research team found an unexpected culprit. For decades, scientists have considered amyloid beta oligomers as more toxic than the larger amyloid beta fibrils that form plaques, which appear later in Alzheimer's disease. But not all amyloid beta oligomers are the same. The Northwestern scientists discovered one uniquely problematic subtype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We identified a distinct amyloid beta oligomer subtype that appears inside neurons and on nearby reactive astrocytes very early in the disease," Kranz said. "It potentially acts as an instigator of early Alzheimer's pathology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called ACU193&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; because it is detected by the antibody ACU193, the subtype shows up early inside of stressed neurons, the scientists found. Then, these oligomers appear to migrate to the surfaces of nearby astrocytes. When ACU193&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligomers latch onto astrocytes, they may spark a cascade of inflammation that spreads throughout the brain, long before memory loss begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A potential prophylaxis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NU-9 targeted and dramatically reduced this subtype, suggesting the drug may be especially valuable at Alzheimer's earliest stages, when intervention is most effective. By reducing this subtype, NU-9 potentially could prevent the activation of astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they serve as the brain's frontline responders, astrocytes become destructive when pushed into a reactive state. This destructive behavior damages synapses, releases inflammatory molecules and accelerates neurodegeneration. Stopping this process might be one of the most powerful ways to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kranz and Silverman likened the strategy to early intervention approaches for preventing cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most people are used to monitoring their cholesterol levels," Silverman said. "If you have high cholesterol, it doesn't mean that you will have a heart attack soon. But it's time to take drugs to lower your cholesterol levels to prevent that heart attack from happening down the road. NU-9 could play a similar role. If someone has a biomarker signaling Alzheimer's disease, then they could start taking NU-9 before symptoms appear."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are a couple early diagnostic blood tests for Alzheimer's disease in development," Klein added. "The promise of better early diagnostics -- combined with a drug that could stop the disease in its tracks -- is the goal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the team is testing NU-9 in additional models of Alzheimer's disease, including an animal model of late-onset disease that better reflects typical human aging. The researchers also plan to follow animals for a longer period of time to determine whether symptoms develop in treated animals and plan to examine how early intervention with NU-9 affects memory and neuron health over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, "Identification of a glia-associated amyloid beta oligomer subtype and the rescue from reactive astrogliosis by inhibitor NU-9," was supported by the National Institute of Health (grant AG061708).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The cat later bit Kraig Biehl when he approached her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GSQWVAQUV5DPTKORVLF2MZR3Q4"&gt;“She got within about two feet and went ballistic,” he said. “She just went nuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FYRRK2NVCFB2FHLWD2WURPLETM"&gt;At urgent care, Biehl was treated with rabies immunoglobulin, which is used with the vaccine to prevent infection (he says he was not given that necessary vaccine shot). Miller was uninsured and wanted to confirm whether the cat was rabid before starting a costly treatment. When the patients asked for advice, they say clinic staff told them they had a couple of days to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QVX6GE2IQZCKFLLMIQZ5GFOS2M"&gt;When Biehl went to warn others about Callie, he found out the cat had already bitten a neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MOBGKSVZQRBIZIMFGAQCFHAQ6E"&gt;Miller wanted to trap and quarantine Callie. Biehl opted to shoot the cat to prevent anyone else from being injured. “My philosophy is three strikes, you’re out,” Biehl said. “I had to kill a cat, all right, and then figure out what we’re going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LR446XWF2BAMFIJRTYVASVAASQ"&gt;They said they spent much of a Saturday trying to find someone who could test the cat. Instead, they kept getting shuffled around between different agencies. Now that Callie was dead, they were worried the body would decompose to a point that wasn’t viable for testing, so they felt they did not have much time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:5BXOG4YUCVCT7JY5QDR4XWF53M" data-fusion-component="5BXOG4YUCVCT7JY5QDR4XWF53M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:5BXOG4YUCVCT7JY5QDR4XWF53M" data-fusion-component="5BXOG4YUCVCT7JY5QDR4XWF53M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="23PPN3WKNVHUFNGR3ZPFHLRGHY"&gt;They called the State Police troop that oversees the township and were told to call the Pennsylvania Game Commission, which separately referred them to the state Department of Health. Meanwhile, Janet Biehl called two local veterinarians, both of whom said they couldn’t help, either due to lack of staff or because they weren’t previously clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RUS75WWOBZGYVJ4JY47LGH3OZE"&gt;“We just felt helpless in the beginning, because we didn’t know what we were doing,” Kraig Biehl said. “We knew the possibility of rabies, but we’re not familiar with rabies at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OJYZGXOKARDL7HWT7XCI4OQXK4"&gt;Eventually, the Biehls were able to get in touch with a health worker and a community health nurse at a regional Department of Health office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ULRD6QBLEJGSJIE7Z3TWU7TPKM"&gt;The worker said a Department of Health lab in Exton could test for rabies, but could only accept a head. A spokesperson for the agency told Spotlight PA that staff recommended the Biehls contact a local veterinarian to euthanize the animal, prepare it for testing, and send the specimen to the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VQWZ6DJ5ORCBVKUIEKP7LE4JJM"&gt;Kraig decided he would have to do it himself with the help of a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SAYZMO647RG7XKLOOSA63VQTDE"&gt;“I’m really not interested in cutting the cat’s head off, right?” Biehl said. “However, at that point, you do what you got to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Costly gaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XHDHB7ZGZVH6FDJSSJYE5ITTLA"&gt;For the Biehl family, one of the biggest challenges was that their municipality — Perry Township — does not contract with a company, or employ staff, specifically for animal control services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CDVAXLXH3JB6TKIX2JGNGPVCV4"&gt;Neither does Berks County, which also does not have “specific rabies response staffing,” according to Kimberly Fies, director of agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R4SM76XHIRAQLI6LC7W4S5U4AY"&gt;“I would believe that, if there is some significant outbreak, we could coordinate with the [county] Department of Emergency Services to get some notification out to the municipality,” Fies told Spotlight PA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KHOTWC6RJNCQFDIWQ7ECUVTCFI"&gt;A county spokesperson said its role is limited to making referrals to the Game Commission, the local Animal Rescue League (ARL), or the Humane Society, “barring an emergency situation or an outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6ETCEYVHY5DOXOCUB6JFGNLVLA"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; READ MORE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/berks/2025/12/berks-county-rabies-resources-feral-cats-domestic-animals-health/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;What Berks County residents need to know if they encounter a rabid animal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EMBRC6L3A5FD7D53HS3ULU4GWY"&gt;Six Berks County municipalities pay ARL for animal control services and rabies response: Bern Township, Jefferson Township, New Morgan Borough, Reading, Upper Bern Township, and Wyomissing Borough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-32" data-gaid="inarticle-32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P4LHC2WG4NDVXFYMFHUWPVTIU4"&gt;Ashley Mikulsky, chief executive officer of ARL, said the nonprofit has also responded to rabies cases outside those areas when alerted by residents. All involved cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-33" data-gaid="inarticle-33"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K7B3WHQOWRHZZK7CLXQWYGFOZU"&gt;Residents outside the coverage area can call ARL to rent out traps and get guidance on best practices for trapping an animal, but they do not have staff readily available to go out to places that do not have local animal control services. ARL can help with testing, at their discretion and at a cost: $100 for the euthanasia ($150 if the animal weighs over 20 pounds) and $250 for specimen prep and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-34" data-gaid="inarticle-34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UFAFRGXYUZEMXAXR63WUKZBQP4"&gt;While ARL fills the gap when it can, Mikulsky said the system ultimately leaves residents — and her staff — carrying costs that should fall on local governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-35" data-gaid="inarticle-35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IRMLR65RAFDFBGL3H3NDXY2UWQ"&gt;“You cannot rely on a nonprofit to be the unpaid public health and safety for animal control. That’s crazy,” Mikulsky said. “If you have a contractual relationship with them, sure. But that’s what I think we’ve arrived at in Berks County, is many of these municipalities either don’t want to or cannot pay for full-service animal control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-36" data-gaid="inarticle-36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7MRGOL2JDRFLPDDUWYS2UVZOJI"&gt;In many cases, local police departments will dispatch officers to put down potentially rabid animals, but Mikulsky said relying on officers is not a solution for communities that lack local animal control services. Officers often lack the equipment to handle rabid animals and are not aware of the steps that need to happen after an animal is killed, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-37" data-gaid="inarticle-37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:FVDIVGLI4RCZLJCAS2OU2LCZWU" data-fusion-component="FVDIVGLI4RCZLJCAS2OU2LCZWU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:FVDIVGLI4RCZLJCAS2OU2LCZWU" data-fusion-component="FVDIVGLI4RCZLJCAS2OU2LCZWU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-38" data-gaid="inarticle-38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;A lack of resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-39" data-gaid="inarticle-39"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VYKUF2I4LBDZ3LB64KT3ERAC4Q"&gt;The problem is not unique to Berks County. Many Pennsylvania municipalities lack the funding necessary to have an animal control officer on staff, according to Aliza Simeone, assistant professor of clinical infectious diseases and biosecurity at the University of Pennsylvania’s PennVet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-40" data-gaid="inarticle-40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XSD2D6AKQFGEDEWRLKGJWKQS2I"&gt;“In many counties in Pennsylvania, they don’t have the same services down to a local level, so they don’t have somebody you can call to come out and get that animal, whereas they do in some of our more populated areas, like in Philadelphia,” said Simeone, who is also a former veterinary medical field officer for the state Department of Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-41" data-gaid="inarticle-41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NILMMUWYKRBHZH7BYXBVY6AESY"&gt;In some cases, municipal employees may not be qualified to provide guidance if a resident calls for help. When Kraig Biehl called Perry Township to report the case, he was told to contact the Game Commission, even though that agency does not handle feral cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-42" data-gaid="inarticle-42"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FBTROFOJIZAOVHF35DFYUEKB3M"&gt;“They dropped me like a hot rock,” Biehl said. “All I want to do is inform.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-43" data-gaid="inarticle-43"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KGIDGVMOI5EPVGTHRJHC43SUII"&gt;When Spotlight PA visited the Perry Township municipal building, an employee directed the reporter to contact the Game Commission and declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-44" data-gaid="inarticle-44"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5P6L4HQWWRENJIHR4IUWQIJR54"&gt;The challenges deepen when the animal in question is not a pet, but a feral cat — a category that sits in a gray area of responsibility. A spokesperson for the Game Commission said “stray and feral cats are not considered wildlife, and do not fall under our general jurisdiction.” If a pet has been exposed to a potentially rabid wild animal, and that animal is still in the vicinity, the agency will send a game warden to locate and put down the suspect animal and have it tested for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-45" data-gaid="inarticle-45"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RJA4VKJ3BZAANJMBVULZSYQH4U"&gt;The Department of Agriculture can issue quarantine orders and give guidance for pets exposed to rabies, but it does not have field staff who can trap and euthanize an animal showing signs of the disease. Spokesperson Shannon Powers said the agency “does not capture feral cats for any purpose.” In instances in which there is no local animal control, the department advises residents to report the suspected rabid animal to local law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-46" data-gaid="inarticle-46"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W4DCHALBRRCNNJD5P6HWV6VXY4"&gt;Berks County had 10 confirmed rabies infections in animals in 2023, 11 in 2024, and 17 so far in 2025. Of this year’s total, four were cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-47" data-gaid="inarticle-47"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K6Z3Q35CSZADZHSLPQPF6IVKME"&gt;In 2023, Pennsylvania &lt;a href="https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/263/10/javma.25.05.0344.xml" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;ranked fourth&lt;/a&gt; among U.S. states for confirmed animal rabies cases. Simeone said Pennsylvania reports high numbers of cases, in part, because the state has more labs that can test for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-48" data-gaid="inarticle-48"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3QNJSSYBONEDDB6VQVBGUB44M4"&gt;“It’s just a fact of life in Pennsylvania, because we have raccoon strain rabies here, and have for several decades now, so that particular virus does a better job of getting into other animals,” Simeone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-49" data-gaid="inarticle-49"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XYVX5OUQE5FA3NDODMQHHMEFHE"&gt;Neil Ruhland, a Department of Health spokesperson, said rabies cases in animals are “normal yearly occurrences” and that there is “nothing abnormal about current levels.” Powers echoed that, saying “the level of reported cases of animals confirmed to have rabies is not sufficient to warrant alarm or widespread new measures, beyond those already in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-50" data-gaid="inarticle-50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HLP7C2K62FBSFMLS6MU7VGEENE"&gt;Miller was treated with the rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin after Callie tested positive. Since Miller does not have health insurance, the initial hospital bill was $21,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-51" data-gaid="inarticle-51"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YXG3XPVFOJB3JCJ2SB5ZCKES6I"&gt;The Penn State hospital forgave about $15,000 of the bill after Miller provided financial information, and she’s in the process of negotiating a lower bill and setting up a payment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-52" data-gaid="inarticle-52"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F77GOXRXUJGN3G7VVVCL4FGOYE"&gt;The Department of Health does not have assistance programs to help pay for rabies treatment, Ruhland said.

They spent their summers roaming the countryside, parking their trailer beside rivers, lakes and creeks, Meme said. They spent winters traveling abroad, visiting China, Iceland, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and, most frequently, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;In 2017, the couple moved to Benson, Arizona, a tiny town of about 5,000 residents outside Tucson.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Al’s life changed one evening last year when he forgot how to put on his pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Meme said he kept trying to put his shirt on head-first through the neckline, effectively putting the shirt on upside down, and he couldn’t figure out the proper way to wear it. They were baffled.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;div class="image-container col-12 float-none pl-0 pr-0" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#articleImageModalcafce2b8-609c-58b4-92dd-129f3940e4c9" data-uuid="cafce2b8-609c-58b4-92dd-129f3940e4c9"&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="bottom-container"&gt;
        &lt;p class="caption"&gt;Al Jason, 78, signed a statement committing not to drive once his wife, Meme, and their son, Ben, decide he is no longer fit to do so. Al was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease last year. The couple moved from Benson, Ariz., to La Plata County after his diagnosis to be closer to their son. (Jerry McBride/Durango Herald)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Then, Al said, he felt the inclination to play the guitar – a life-long hobby. But when he moved to strum the instrument’s strings, he couldn’t recall how to play any of the 100-some songs he’d learned over his lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Something was wrong, the couple said, but they didn’t know what. They called their doctor, who initially ruled out dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="content-part__text"&gt;            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the most commonly diagnosed form of dementia, characterized by the decline of cognitive skills starting with memory and, as the disease progresses, affecting language, reasoning and social skills, according to the National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;People with Alzheimer’s eventually lose the ability to perform simple daily tasks, including eating and walking, the NIA said. Symptoms typically begin to manifest in a patient’s mid-60s.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Alzheimer’s is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, according to the NIA. Although no cure exists, medications and treatments do.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Sheila Lee, co-facilitator of the Durango Dementia Caregiver Support Group, said dementia patients often require constant supervision after the disease develops past its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="factbox-dropdown-button-container"&gt;
        &lt;i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-down factbox-dropdown-button"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Dementia doesn’t come on just like, ‘bang.’ This is delirium,” Meme said, recalling her doctor’s early assessment of Al’s health.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Their doctor said Al should have an MRI to be sure, Meme said. He had one, and his neurologist determined he did indeed have dementia – Alzheimer’s to be precise.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;After Al’s diagnosis, the couple decided to move to La Plata County to be closer to their son, Ben, who had been trying to convince them to move for some time, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__subheadline"&gt;Adjusting to a new way of life&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Peering across her living room, which was lit up by Christmas lights and colorful holiday decorations, Meme reminisced about her old home in Benson.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“I had this enormous yard and the cutest little gingerbread house that I had covered with Christmas stuff. And now this is my space,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Al said people would drive by their home in Benson and stop to admire their decorations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Their home wasn’t large or extravagant, but its decorations were the most popular, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Lights and ornaments aren’t the only thing decorating the family’s kitchen and living room. Small notes are posted here and there reminding Al to make sure the freezer door is closed, stove burners are off, and how to reboot a laptop when it freezes or stops working.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“If TV won’t go to Hulu programs (says we’re working on it), first try unplugging both cords + turn back on,” one note written in red and yellow marker read. “If that doesn’t work, try putting in password.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;A poster near a door lists items to remember when leaving the house: cane, book, phone, wallet, walker, glasses, grocery lists, hearing aid, shopping bags, handicap placard – among others.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Meme said she posted the reminders for Al, but she occasionally benefits from them herself.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“I’m in the mild stage as far as I know,” Al said of his Alzheimer’s. “To me, what it means is I forget stuff that’s pretty minor, usually, and current. My long-term memory is still sharp as a tack.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="article__subheadline"&gt;Music and memories&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Al enjoys reading and word games, playing guitar and thinking about his children who he said he and Meme raised with love. He is forgetful sometimes, but he remembers his kids, recognizes his wife and hasn’t forgotten anything major, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;In educating themselves about how his Alzheimer’s could progress, Al and Meme read a book written by a man with Alzheimer’s. The book was “very lucid,” Al said, and its author wrote about how he’d sometimes fail to remember who his wife was.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;He said he’s on medication, and from the research he’s done and the experts he’s spoken with, it could be years before his mind seriously deteriorates.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“It could be years, longer – I mean, maybe a decade – before I start really going bonkers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;He said he hasn’t shied away from telling people about his diagnosis. He’s been met with disbelief, but he insists.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Somebody would say, ‘Oh, you don’t have this.’ And I said, ‘Oh, but I do,’” he said. “I’m the only one in my own head. The process that I’m going through, I share with everybody and let them know, ‘Hey, take my word for it. This happened.’”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;He said he has begun recording his guitar sessions to preserve his music and to remind himself how to play. Not trusting his memory, he has a notebook full of lyrics and tablatures he reads as he plays. Meme finds the songs online and handwrites them into his notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;He has recorded about 50 songs out of 100 or more so far, Meme said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“I don’t attempt to remember the lyrics,” Al said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;He said he learned how to play the guitar by ear when he was young, and if he doesn’t like the way a song is going, it’s easy to transpose the melody into a different key. He’ll fiddle with it until he finds something he likes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Some of his favorite songs to play are “Abilene” by George Hamilton IV and “Angel From Montgomery” by John Prine, Meme said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said she and Al also journal regularly. They enjoy going to the Sky Ute Casino in Ignacio, and as they’re eating lunch, they will jot down memories of their adventures together.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said if Al does forget something, she hopes reading his own recount of it – or Meme reading it to him – could trigger his memory.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Maybe I’m writing so I have something that verifies that I did all this crap,” Al said, adding he and Meme have journaled all their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__subheadline"&gt;A well-lived life with no regrets&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The couple receives a $1,000 stipend from the Durango Dementia Coalition. They attend a Memory Cafe at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in Durango and a support group for people recently diagnosed with dementia and their caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Meme said the coalition is a great place to connect with resources, but transportation has been a consistent hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;For now, Al can still drive, although he has set his own boundaries – he won’t drive with kids or grandkids in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Is somebody going to tell me when I can’t do it anymore? I hope so,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;On Sept. 22, he signed a statement committing not to drive when Meme and his son decide he is no longer fit to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“When Ben and Meme both decide it is no longer safe for me to drive, I agree to give up driving,” the note reads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="responsive-embed responsive-yt1"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Al is optimistic despite his diagnosis. He said he could very well die of some other cause before his Alzheimer’s becomes a serious issue. Picking up a Bible, he said he is a believer.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“My faith is firm, and I believe that everybody will get the same chance I did, whether it’s after they die or whatever, to make that commitment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Al and Meme looked after Meme’s mother who was diagnosed with dementia in her 90s. They attended support groups back then, and Al said he remembers meeting couples whose family members had much more severe cases than Meme’s mother did.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“I was aware this could have been a way lot worse,” Al said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;He is planning a summer cruise to Norway with his children – what could be his last big family outing, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;When Al received his diagnosis last year, he and some of his children spent Christmas at his former home in Benson. He said they talked about how most future family gatherings would require the children to come to him.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“We’ve had a fantastic life, so we can’t have any regrets,” Meme said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Offhand, she bemoaned how busy her children’s busy lives have become.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“I’d much rather (Al) have Alzheimer’s than lose him,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The Durango Dementia Coalition was founded in 2022 by Pat Demarest. She said the organization started as a grassroots effort to improve care and services for dementia patients in La Plata County.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Last year, the coalition merged with the nonprofit Southwest Colorado Respite Resource, whose mission was to provide respite resources, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“I lost my husband Oct. 5 to this dreaded disease,” Demarest said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said she moved away from Durango in 2022 because of losing family support, but the Durango Dementia Coalition has continued and she remains involved from afar thanks to modern technology.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;There is a wealth of resources out there for people experiencing dementia, she said. The coalition just needs to get the word out.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="content-part__text"&gt;            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Dementia is a disease that cripples the mind by eroding cognitive functions such as memory, language and social skills. Over time, it warps a person’s personality and takes away his or her independence, impacting one’s ability to perform even simple daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease alone – the most common type of dementia – affects about 1,100 people in La Plata County and more than 7 million Americans across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Dementia imposes significant physical and financial burdens on families across La Plata County. Though there is no cure for dementia of any kind, patients and their caregivers can live more comfortably with medication and certain lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hudson, the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;, lives the NYC dog life to the fullest — big smiles, dramatic sploots, and strong main-character energy on @hudsonbegood. But apparently, being the “Goodest Boy” doesn’t mean you’re automatically thrilled when a brand-new human shows up. In a throwback video, Hudson decided to do what older siblings do best — remind mom which child showed up first. It is a hilarious look at the reality of life with a dog who isn’t quite ready to share the spotlight yet, especially when there are cute hats involved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-video-shows-dog-doing-this-to-remind-mom-that-he-is-still-her-first-child"&gt;Video shows dog doing this to remind mom that he is still her first child&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video opens on a tight shot of a sleeping baby, completely unaware of what’s about to happen. Hudson is right there, his nose almost touching the baby’s red and white woolen hat. At first, it feels protective — and then you notice Hudson’s gaze drifting straight to the pom-pom. Despite his mom repeatedly telling him “no,” Hudson gently grabs the top of the hat. Somehow, he manages the grab without waking the baby at all, which honestly feels like a skill he’s perfected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, he goes for it and pulls the hat right off the infant’s head. The baby doesn’t react at all. And Hudson hops onto the couch with his trophy, looking totally unbothered by his mom’s warnings. Even when she tries to take it back, Hudson holds on with a sheepish but firm resolve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On his brother’s birthday, Hudson joked from his own POV: “Sorry not sorry little bro… I love stealing your hats.” Nothing about it feels malicious. It just feels like a reminder… from someone who’s been around longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The comment section is full of people rooting for Hudson, and the video’s already passed 32,000 likes. One commenter pointed out that these unscripted moments are always the funniest to look back on. Others joked that the baby will probably be stealing Hudson’s toys in a few years, so it is only fair that the dog gets a head start. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;

New routines don’t stick overnight. A classic study found that it takes &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674" target="_blank"&gt;on average 66 days&lt;/a&gt; of practicing a new dietary or physical behavior each day before it becomes a habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SM6CNLN4QZG3RPYKYVNAML5SCY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You need to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15702599/" target="_blank"&gt;make it easy&lt;/a&gt; to make it last. So choose one habit and list every barrier that will keep you from hitting the mark. Then pre-solve each one. Is it too cold to go for a jog early in the morning? Find a 30-minute cardio routine on YouTube that you can do in your bedroom. Don’t have time to cook veggies from scratch? Frozen vegetables can save you time and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 10:09:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5EcDJQMHFtUmlwX3NnVXdJYzRnYVltR1I3SUlGWFBKV3l6OWttX1l6QmMwcFFOcFpwQ1RoSHE1akpPbW1MbUxlcVR2S2dKbkwtWXBZRkVwdGlQYlZ1RVpvMk5uTkxqc3hhUWJkWWYzTEkySTBucnM1eEJERFg</guid></item><item><title>祈祷奇迹-盲人母亲在独自抚养孩子的同时与格雷夫斯病作斗争-牙买加之星</title><link>https://jamaica-star.com/article/news/20251222/praying-miracle-blind-mother-battles-graves%E2%80%99-disease-while-raising-children</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxPVDhSUWRBemE1czVZWW9fbVVSbEVLMHE4U1ZWVmx6UjUxSWF4U3NBeWdZTWVFejlSaEh0ejJ1SEpCb1Y5M21tWUdRSy0zeTlrRWhnZUhxeGlHZ0dWRDI0YlpGZkNXbTRqTEE5QkhHa185dElCUHFPMnhkWXpoWkNmdV9xUVBZZDVPU3JOYWhsRERTcC02M0JnQzZNRjdaX21zb2dDM2xjRnlxRmVqTk9MSFBOeDZ5YlYzNElXNFNhT2VtTTJNQVExUGhR?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Praying for a miracle - Blind mother battles Graves’ disease while raising children alone&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Jamaica Star&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>Jamaica Star</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 10:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxPVDhSUWRBemE1czVZWW9fbVVSbEVLMHE4U1ZWVmx6UjUxSWF4U3NBeWdZTWVFejlSaEh0ejJ1SEpCb1Y5M21tWUdRSy0zeTlrRWhnZUhxeGlHZ0dWRDI0YlpGZkNXbTRqTEE5QkhHa185dElCUHFPMnhkWXpoWkNmdV9xUVBZZDVPU3JOYWhsRERTcC02M0JnQzZNRjdaX21zb2dDM2xjRnlxRmVqTk9MSFBOeDZ5YlYzNElXNFNhT2VtTTJNQVExUGhR</guid></item><item><title>一些患者在获得艾滋病毒预防药物方面面临障碍。以下是须知事项-美国国家公共广播电台</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/12/22/nx-s1-5645054/hiv-prevention-drug-prep-billing</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a librarian in Berkeley, Calif., was looking to take PrEP to prevent HIV, the doctor hadn't heard of the medicine, and the bills that came were expensive ... and wrong.  The process was so frustrating that at one point they wondered, "Am I just going to stop this medication to stop having to deal with these coding issues and these scary bills?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— Matthew Hurley, 30, from Berkeley, California&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, Matthew Hurley got the kind of text people fear. It said: "When was the last time you were STD tested?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Someone Hurley had recently had unprotected sex with had just tested positive for HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Hurley, who uses they/them pronouns, went to a clinic and got tested. "Luckily, I had not caught HIV, but it was a wake-up call," they said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That experience moved Hurley to seek out PrEP, shorthand for preexposure prophylaxis. The antiretroviral medication greatly reduces the chance of getting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The therapy is &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/using-hiv-medication-to-reduce-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis" target="_blank"&gt;99% effective&lt;/a&gt; at protecting people against sexual transmission when taken as prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hurley started PrEP and all was well for the first nine months — until their health insurance changed and they started seeing a new doctor: "When I brought PrEP up to him, he said, 'What's that?' And I was like, oh boy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hurley, who is a librarian, went into teaching mode. They explained that the PrEP regimen they'd been on required daily pills and lab work every three months to look out for breakthrough infections or other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Hurley was surprised they knew more about PrEP than the physician. The FDA approved the first drug, Truvada, &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2012/021752_truvada_toc.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and Hurley lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, a place with one of the &lt;a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-rankings-metro-areas/" target="_blank"&gt;highest concentrations&lt;/a&gt; of LGBTQ+ people in the nation and a &lt;a href="https://www.sfaf.org/collections/status/from-awareness-to-activism/" target="_blank"&gt;deep history&lt;/a&gt; of HIV and health care activism. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hurley said older friends and acquaintances who survived the AIDS epidemic shared the horror of living through a time when there was no effective treatment or drugs for prevention. Deciding to take PrEP felt like an empowering way to protect their health and their community.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Hurley pushed the doctor, and after the physician did his own research, he agreed to prescribe PrEP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hurley got the care they needed, but they had to be the expert in the exam room.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;blockquote class="edTag"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Care Helpline helps you navigate the health system hurdles between you and good care. Send us your tricky question and we may assign a reporter to puzzle it out.&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/health-care-helpline-share-your-story/" target="_blank"&gt; Share your story and your question here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's a big burden," said Beth Oller, a family medicine physician and board member of GLMA, a national organization of LGBTQ+ and allied health care professionals focused on health equity. "You really want someone you can just go in and talk [to] about your health concerns without feeling like you are having to educate and advocate for yourself at every turn."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Oller said many queer people have had &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/lgbt-peoples-health-status-and-access-to-care/" target="_blank"&gt;negative experiences&lt;/a&gt; during health care visits. "I have a lot of patients who had not done preventive care for years because of the medical stigma," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Billing Headaches&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Clearing the access hurdles to HIV prevention medicine was just the beginning. Hurley started receiving a string of bills for PrEP-related care: Blood test: $271.80. Office visit: $263.&lt;br&gt;Again, Hurley was surprised. They knew — even if the billing office didn't — that under the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/sexual-health-preventive-services-covered-by-the-aca/" target="_blank"&gt;Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt;, most private insurance plans and Medicaid expansion programs are &lt;a href="https://nastad.org/sites/default/files/2021-12/PDF-PrEP-Coverage-Brief.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;required to cover&lt;/a&gt; PrEP and ancillary services, &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/prevention-of-human-immunodeficiency-virus-hiv-infection-pre-exposure-prophylaxis#bootstrap-panel--7" target="_blank"&gt;like lab tests&lt;/a&gt;, as preventive with no cost sharing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The bills for doctor visits and blood draws piled up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hurley would appeal the bill and get a denial almost every time. Then, they would appeal again.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hurley shared a series of appeal letters for one service, in which the billing office acknowledged that blood work had been initially incorrectly coded as diagnostic. Once that was corrected, Hurley said, the insurer paid for the service.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That might sound quick or easy to resolve, but Hurley said it took "forever to get through the process." They dealt with at least six incorrect bills over several months. Hurley estimated they spent more than 60 hours contesting the bills.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During that time, Hurley said, the billing department "is continuing to send me emails and bills that are saying, &lt;em&gt;You're overdue. You're overdue. You're overdue.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fed up with the hassles, Hurley decided to find a health provider (and billing office) better informed about PrEP. They settled on the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The care team there was able to discuss the pros and cons of different PrEP regimens and knew how to navigate the formulary for Hurley's insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hurley hasn't gotten an unexpected bill since.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But siloing sexual health care and PrEP off from primary care hasn't been ideal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I have multiple organizations that I have to deal with to get my holistic health dealt with," Hurley said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A provider doesn't need to be an HIV specialist, an infectious disease expert, or a physician to prescribe PrEP. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages primary care providers to treat PrEP like &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/130758" target="_blank"&gt;other preventive medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To avoid some of the headaches Hurley faced, try these tips:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1.  Do your homework to learn if PrEP is right for you&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/New-Injectable-HIV-PrEP%20.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20most%20recent,available%20strategies%20for%20preventing%20HIV." target="_blank"&gt;2.2 million&lt;/a&gt; Americans could benefit from HIV prevention drugs, but just over a quarter of that group have been prescribed them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-103273" class="bucketwrap image small"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Not enough people know about PrEP, and there are a number of people who know about PrEP but do not realize it's for them," said Jeremiah Johnson, executive director of PrEP4All, an organization dedicated to universal access to HIV prevention and medication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC's clinical guidelines, PrEP can be prescribed as part of a preventive health plan to &lt;a href="https://kff4.sharepoint.com/sites/KHNLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewid=83609977%2D1a7a%2D4af3%2D9cfb%2D9decb10cf0f8&amp;amp;ga=1&amp;amp;id=%2Fsites%2FKHNLibrary%2FShared%20Documents%2Fteam%5Faudio%2FHealth%20Care%20Helpline%2FQueer%20Health%20Helpline%2Fcdc%5F130758%5FDS1%2Epdf&amp;amp;parent=%2Fsites%2FKHNLibrary%2FShared%20Documents%2Fteam%5Faudio%2FHealth%20Care%20Helpline%2FQueer%20Health%20Helpline" target="_blank"&gt;anyone who's sexually active&lt;/a&gt;. It's especially recommended for people who don't use condoms consistently, intravenous drug users who share needles, men who have sex with men, and people in relationships with partners living with HIV or whose HIV status is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of PrEP users are men. There are big race, gender, and geographical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12256081/" target="_blank"&gt;disparities in the distribution&lt;/a&gt; of HIV and the populations taking the prevention medicine. For example, based on the patterns of new infection in the U.S., a group that would benefit from PrEP is &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/prep-hiv-prevention-drug-cisgender-black-women/" target="_blank"&gt;cisgender Black women&lt;/a&gt;, whose gender identity aligns with their sex assigned at birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Don't assume your provider knows about PrEP&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If your doctors aren't well informed, start by &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/pre-exposure-prophylaxis-prep" target="_blank"&gt;educating yourself&lt;/a&gt;. There are also clinical guidelines and information you can share with your provider. Check your state or local health department for a how-to guide for prescribing PrEP. For example, the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute has information &lt;a href="https://www.hivguidelines.org/guideline/hiv-prep/" target="_blank"&gt;for providers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hivnexus/hcp/prep/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC also has PrEP guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, but many of the agency's websites dealing with LGBTQ+ health are in flux. Under the Trump administration, some HIV/AIDS resources have been taken down from federal websites. Others now have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/prep.html" target="_blank"&gt;headers saying&lt;/a&gt;: "This page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department rejects it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Get lab work in-network&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Johnson said Hurley's experience with billing mistakes is common. "The lab expenses in particular end up being very tricky," Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-103274" class="bucketwrap image small"&gt;

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;
        
        Oona Zenda/KFF Health News
        
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For example, a doctor's office may mistakenly code the lab work required for PrEP as a &lt;a href="https://nastad.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/PDF-HIV-Prevention-BillingAndCoding-101223.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;diagnostic test&lt;/a&gt; instead of preventive care. Patients like Hurley can end up with a bill they shouldn't have to pay. If your doctor's office is making mistakes, share the &lt;a href="https://nastad.org/resources/billing-coding-guide-hiv-prevention" target="_blank"&gt;PrEP billing and coding guide&lt;/a&gt; from NASTAD, an association of public health officials who administer HIV and hepatitis programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Try to get your lab work done in-network. If the lab is out-of-network, Johnson said, it can be difficult to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the bills keep coming, appeal them. And if you can't resolve the dispute, Johnson said, file a complaint with the agency that regulates your insurance plan.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;4.  Look for ways to save&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of PrEP. There are lower-cost, generic versions of Truvada, for example, sold as emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, often shortened to FTC/TDF. Newer PrEP drugs &lt;a href="https://viivuspricing.com/apretude.html" target="_blank"&gt;Apretude and Yeztugo&lt;/a&gt; have list prices in the thousands of dollars. Check your insurance formulary and ask your doctor to prescribe medicine your plan will cover.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With many health care premiums set to dramatically increase and millions at risk of losing Medicaid coverage, many people may go without health insurance in 2026. Drug manufacturers such as &lt;a href="https://advancingaccessconsent.iassist.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gilead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.viivconnect.com/hcp/orals/" target="_blank"&gt;Viiv&lt;/a&gt; have assistance programs for qualifying patients. If you have to pay out-of-pocket, prescription price comparison websites, like GoodRx, can help you find the pharmacies with the cheapest price.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;5. Consider telehealth&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Telehealth is an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2842105" target="_blank"&gt;increasingly popular&lt;/a&gt; option if you don't live near an affirming provider or are looking for a more private way to get PrEP. In 2024, roughly 1 in 5 people on PrEP used telemedicine. Online pharmacies like &lt;a href="https://heymistr.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mistr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://qcareplus.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Q Care Plus&lt;/a&gt; offer PrEP without an in-person appointment, and lab work can be done at home. Some telehealth options have ways to &lt;a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2025/12/hs_telemedicine_hiv_prep_02-12-2025/story.html" target="_blank"&gt;lower the cost&lt;/a&gt; if you're uninsured.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Telehealth can also broaden the number of doctors who are ready to prescribe PrEP. And some patients say speaking with a remote provider feels like a safer setting to talk about sexual health. "They're in the comfort of their own bedroom or living room but can interface virtually with a provider. It can open up a lot of doors for honesty and trust," said Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-103275" class="bucketwrap image small"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;6. Seek Out Affirming Care&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;GLMA created the &lt;a href="https://lgbtqhealthcaredirectory.org/" target="_blank"&gt;LGBTQ+ Healthcare Directory&lt;/a&gt;, a searchable database of health care providers across the nation who identify as queer-friendly. As Hurley discovered, living in a major metro area is no guarantee your doctor is up to date on LGBTQ+ health care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ask locals you trust for recommendations. You might be surprised to find good options nearby.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health Care Helpline helps you navigate the health system hurdles between you and good care.

While we usually hear about cool breakthroughs and feel-good discoveries, there’s a darker side of science that doesn’t make it into textbooks or dinner conversations. These are the facts that make you pause, blink twice, and quietly think about how unsettling it all is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To our fascination, netizens revealed the most terrifying science facts most people don’t know about. Some facts challenge how safe we think we are, while others remind us how little control we actually have, and as usual, we have rounded up some of the best, most interesting ones for your &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/entertainment/" class=" staff-link"&gt;entertainment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More info: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1p9c9mp/whats_the_scariest_science_fact_that_the_public/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="" class="alignnone image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cover_83003633a46763e7743baf3a8c5157ab.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-items clearfix "&gt;  &lt;p class="desktop-in-content-ad post-ads "&gt; &lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt; &lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9763304"&gt;  &lt;p id="9763304" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty-images-ATmFFkvsF98-unsplash-6932fd8f9432f__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Scientist in protective gear examines samples using a microscope in a lab exploring disturbing science facts." title="Scientist in protective gear examines samples using a microscope in a lab exploring disturbing science facts." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;The CDC has been eviscerated. &lt;br&gt;Global cooperation &amp;amp; preparedness are at a 60 year low.&lt;br&gt;The next major contagion will make Covid-19 look like a Disney story.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1p9c9mp/whats_the_scariest_science_fact_that_the_public/nrcmwol/" target="_blank"&gt; Congenital0ptimist &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-scientist-using-microscope-during-experiment-in-laboratory-science-and-technology-healthcare-concept-ATmFFkvsF98" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-11278-33/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9763282"&gt;  &lt;p id="9763282" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty-images-N8rzQFGcrZY-unsplash-6932f881a236c__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Scientist in a white coat examining dairy cows in a barn, documenting disturbing science facts for research." title="Scientist in a white coat examining dairy cows in a barn, documenting disturbing science facts for research." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;A lot of the food you eat requires care that has to be provided by veterinarians.

Scientific knowledge relies on models that attempt to explain reality, but these models are always temporary and open to revision when new evidence emerges. Some boundaries come from the methods science uses, others from deeper philosophical issues, and many from the sheer complexity of the universe itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They further highlight that even with advanced technology and computing power, &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/curiosities/science-technology/" class=" staff-link"&gt;science &lt;/a&gt;cannot provide a complete picture of reality. While it is highly effective at observation, measurement, and prediction, it remains unable to answer certain fundamental questions about existence and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9763287"&gt;  &lt;p id="9763287" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/3728-6936978552ab6__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Older male scientist wearing glasses and gloves looking through microscope in a lab, highlighting disturbing science facts." title="Older male scientist wearing glasses and gloves looking through microscope in a lab, highlighting disturbing science facts." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;In 1945 when the scientists on the Manhattan Project tested the very first atomic explosive (the trinity test) some of them had concerns that the blast might ignite the nitrogen in the atmosphere and burn the entire planet to a crisp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My uncle was one of those scientists. He told me about this during a visit when I was a teenager.

While technology and infrastructure create an impression of control, scientific research shows that complex societies often become more vulnerable over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientific models help us &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/psychic-predictions-came-true-stories/" class=" staff-link"&gt;predict &lt;/a&gt;and manage risks, the inherent limits of knowledge mean that unexpected events or cascading failures can still occur.

While this knowledge provides clarity, it can also amplify anxiety by challenging comforting illusions, such as the sense of control or permanence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they suggest that grappling with these truths also promotes long-term resilience, showing that the tension between understanding and discomfort is a natural part of engaging deeply with science and the limits of our &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/curiosities/facts/" class=" staff-link"&gt;knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9763289"&gt;  &lt;p id="9763289" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/engin-akyurt-PcU17evKnew-unsplash-6932f5e37152f__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Woman drinking a glass of water illustrating disturbing science facts about everyday hydration and health awareness." title="Woman drinking a glass of water illustrating disturbing science facts about everyday hydration and health awareness." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Half the population is on anti-depressants, HRT, birth control, and a host of other meds that show up in noticeable concentrations in urine.

Science doesn’t exist to scare us, but every so often it pulls back the curtain and reveals things that challenge our sense of safety and &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/boyfriend-threatening-leave-girlfriend-playing-video-games/" class=" staff-link"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people find comfort in knowing the truth, others wish they could un-read it entirely. Either way, these facts prove that curiosity can be both fascinating and mildly traumatizing, and we advise you to brace up as you keep reading through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9763301"&gt;  &lt;p id="9763301" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/7609256-6932f6a98b2d7__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Silhouette of a person pointing at the starry night sky, illustrating disturbing science facts about the universe." title="Silhouette of a person pointing at the starry night sky, illustrating disturbing science facts about the universe." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;More sad than scary, but the fact that we will never reach the stars no matter how good technology gets is unfortunate.

And sometimes "you can't even work here until you learn CPR". The truth is that outside of the hospital, CPR only works 10-12% of the time, meaning 88% - 90% of the time the person is going to be gone no matter what you do. These statistics only go down the older a person gets. So, when you're pumping on a person who 70+ you're usually blowing into the mouth of a body. Ask a doctor, ask a nurse. Look it up if you don't believe me. Now, I'm not saying that you shouldn't do it, unless they're old or have a DNR order, then you shouldn't. But you're led to believe that it's like a 50-50 outcome or better, and it's most certainly not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now your odds are better in A-fib situations where you have access to an AED. A jolt of electricity is much more effective. But in flat-line situations, you're very often pumping on the body of a gone person, and it's going to traumatize you.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1p9c9mp/whats_the_scariest_science_fact_that_the_public/nrc06zk/" target="_blank"&gt; Dizzy_Beginning1441 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/group-of-people-learning-how-to-make-first-aid-heart-compressions-with-dummies-during-the-training-indoors-close-up-view-on-the-hands-and-dummies-27RXXsJzdXY" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-11278-34/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9763280"&gt;  &lt;p id="9763280" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty-images-TRZYXrfmIN0-unsplash-6932f23242544__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Scientist in a lab coat and safety glasses examining samples under a microscope revealing disturbing science facts." title="Scientist in a lab coat and safety glasses examining samples under a microscope revealing disturbing science facts." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;1.

It requires nearly all food to be cooked to high temperatures — or, as some have described it, “boiled to death” — to reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses. But since evidence in recent years suggested the diet didn’t actually help ward off infections, doctors started leaning away from a strict neutropenic diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study published last week in the&lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO-25-00889#abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Journal of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt; is giving some physicians pause about fresh fruits and vegetables for patients whose treatment involves heavy suppression of the immune system, particularly neutrophils, white blood cells that are key to preventing infection. Contrary to research in the past, the trial found that certain blood cancer patients who were allowed a less restrictive or liberalized diet had 11% more infections than patients who were prescribed the neutropenic diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There has been a move in the last 10 years in liberalizing diets for patients, for sure,” said Talal Hilal, a hematologist oncologist and bone marrow transplant physician at the Mayo Clinic who did not work on the study. But reading the paper, Hilal said, “it does pose the question of maybe we need to revisit how liberal we want to be with our patients.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oncologists first began using the neutropenic diet decades ago, particularly for intensively treated cancer patients like those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplants. These procedures can give certain blood cancer patients an opportunity for a cure, but sometimes use heavy doses of chemotherapy that’s extremely harsh on the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the weakened immune system is recovering after the procedure, infections have a higher potential of turning deadly, until the patient’s cell counts recover. Hospitals have been known to go to great lengths to protect these patients including&lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO-24-02046" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; preventing outside food or fresh flowers&lt;/a&gt; from entering their rooms. As cruel as it may have felt, clinicians assured themselves it was better than potentially introducing dangerous bacteria, viruses, or fungal spores to the defenseless.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Over the years, though, evidence suggested that normal diets don’t pose much of an infection risk. Rather, neutropenic diets were&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3228185/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; blamed&lt;/a&gt; for decreasing patient quality of life and increasing malnutrition. So hospitals have gradually shifted toward being more liberal when it comes to neutropenic patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, a group at the University of Milan published the first &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/12/10/bone-marrow-transplant-patients-neutropenic-diet/"&gt;randomized evidence&lt;/a&gt; that a non-restrictive diet was not inferior to the neutropenic diet for certain stem cell transplant patients in 2023, leading many oncologists to rejoice that the benefits of the neutropenic diet were finally debunked. They also showed a non-restrictive diet improved quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But John Wingard, a hematologist-oncologist and emeritus faculty at the University of Florida, wanted to take another look. In particular, he wanted to know if un-restricting the diet for neutropenic patients would actually improve patients’ nutrition, an ongoing challenge for many cancer patients undergoing intensive therapy. Like the Milan group, Wingard enrolled over 200 blood cancer patients and randomized them to get either a liberalized diet allowing fresh fruits, vegetables, and pasteurized yogurt, or the neutropenic diet. In this study, patients were allowed to eat home-cooked or restaurant food as long as it adhered to diet guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wingard planned to look at how many clinically confirmed infections were in each group at different time periods. “We had to prematurely stop the trial from data safety monitoring committee because the liberalized diet had 11% more infections,” Wingard said. Only about half of the patients who were allowed the liberalized diet actually consumed fresh fruits or vegetables, Wingard added. “When we did an analysis of just the people who complied with the liberalized diet, the rate of infection was 1.5 times higher.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also suggested that allowing the liberalized diet didn’t seem to improve patients’ nutrition or quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taken together, Mayo Clinic’s Hilal said he’s starting to rethink his practice of being more permissive with transplant patients’ diets. “I feel like if you are liberalizing diet and you’re not even seeing improvements in quality of life or nutritional status, then there is no trade-off here. Why would I be very easy with liberalizing my diet, if I don’t benefit in any other domain?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some caveats, Hilal said. For one, the patient population in both the 2023 Milan group study and this study are different. The 2023 paper was a multi-center study, which can help remove hospital-specific biases. It was also done in Europe, where certain practices may be different than what’s typical in the U.S., which could plausibly make comparison harder as well. “They are also a higher-risk population that seems to be enrolled in this JCO paper,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Hilal said he felt the study may reignite a debate on the neutropenic diet, and cancer researchers might argue over the strengths and weaknesses of both trials. “It’ll probably get discussed. People will take sides,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, Hilal and other physicians, including Wingard, said that it’s likely still reasonable to allow a non-restrictive diet with other patients like solid tumor patients who may still be neutropenic, but not as high risk or neutropenic for as long as bone marrow transplant patients. This study also showed that being neutropenic longer was the main variable associated with infection. No patients died during the study intervention either, and oncologists can manage many infections well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for why neither diet improved nutrition or quality of life for patients, Wingard thinks that might be because intensive cancer treatment can leave patients nauseous, without an appetite, and generally uncomfortable. No matter what food they get, some patients will just struggle to eat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think the neutropenic diet is that bad,” Wingard said. “It’s just that patients who have been treated this way have a symptom called dysgeusia, which means everything tastes bad. And then you have nausea and stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Probably the best way to settle the neutropenic diet debate and help patients’ quality of life and nutrition, Wingard said, is to focus on improving treatment. New effective therapies that are less toxic to the immune system would mean there’s no need for something like the neutropenic diet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But federal cuts this year will leave more people exposed to potential foodborne illness in the future, food safety experts predict. The changes they say will degrade U.S. food safety include the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-quietly-scaled-back-surveillance-program-foodborne-illnesses-rcna227089" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reduced number of pathogens&lt;/a&gt; now monitored by a key surveillance program, brain drain of the foodborne illness staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration amid low morale and overwork, and cuts to the administrative staff who support FDA inspectors, which agency officials say has already led to a &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/foreign-food-safety-inspections-historic-low-fda" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;historic low in inspections&lt;/a&gt; of foreign facilities that import food to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that they [the Trump administration] are necessarily choosing to harm the system,” said Daniel Jernigan, who worked at the CDC for 30 years before &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/profiles-cdc-officials-who-resigned-in-protest/"&gt;resigning&lt;/a&gt; from his position as head of the agency’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases in August. “It’s that all of these cuts that are not coherent are all working against each other, and therefore you end up with a system that’s just not functioning well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As it is, foodborne illness causes around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;48 million illnesses and 3,000 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has taken some measures to try to protect food safety, restoring funding to states to carry out more inspections, said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest. Nonetheless, she said, the cumulative effect of the cuts is to make food safety “collateral damage in this war on government.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added, “Consumers are certainly going to feel it when they get sick from outbreaks that could have been prevented.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-cost-of-scaling-back-foodnet"&gt;The cost of scaling back FoodNet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One significant area of concern is the Trump administration’s decision to scale back the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network&lt;/a&gt;, or FoodNet, program, reducing the number of pathogens in its reporting requirements from eight to two — salmonella and E. coli. Ten state health departments participate in the FoodNet program, which surveys about 16% of the U.S. population with the goal of detecting outbreaks early and tracking down their sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-quietly-scaled-back-surveillance-program-foodborne-illnesses-rcna227089" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cited funding issues&lt;/a&gt; as a reason for the change and said that other CDC systems also conduct national surveillance for the pathogens. “Narrowing FoodNet’s reporting requirements and associated activities will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities,” a CDC spokesperson told STAT.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But experts said that what makes FoodNet unique is that it conducts active surveillance, reaching out to state laboratories to ask about cases, rather than passively relying on states to notify the CDC about illness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FoodNet is “the best measure we have for whether the system is working or failing us,” said Sorscher. “So the fact that they cut that first is just really dark.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fault doesn’t just lie with the Trump administration, said Sorscher — Congress has also failed to provide sufficient funding to detect and prevent foodborne illness. (The CDC typically requests a budget of $72 million a year for food safety, about half of which goes to states.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With FoodNet cuts, Sorscher said, “what’s being lost is accuracy and the ability to compare [trends] over time.” That means “we will not be able to say with any certainty moving forward what the DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] cuts did, what the shutdown did. So it really just wipes away any form of accountability for these other changes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carlota Medus, supervisor of the foodborne diseases unit at the Minnesota Department of Health, said via email that the immediate impact of cuts to FoodNet in the state could be the speed with which his department is able to identify the source of an outbreak. “Long term, the cuts will affect our ability to use surveillance data to better understand risks in the food supply, and which areas food producers and regulatory agencies should prioritize,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-drain-pipeline-problems-and-low-morale"&gt;Brain drain, pipeline problems, and low morale&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Food inspectors at the FDA weren’t targeted by federal cuts. But &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/federal-health-worker-cuts-rfk-trump-administration/?_gl=1*wz6vu1*_ga*MTA1NzkzMTMyOS4xNzYxNzQzNjY2*_ga_K9RW8M6GL5*czE3NjU4MTkyOTUkbzExJGcxJHQxNzY1ODE5MzI4JGoyNyRsMCRoMA.." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;65% of support staff&lt;/a&gt; charged with tasks like booking and reimbursing travel were eliminated. Jernigan compares the loss of support staff to a person trying to use a banking app on a smartphone that needs a software update. “The app may be perfectly fine,” he said, “but if you don’t have the operating system on the phone, you’re not going to be able to use the app.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was already a chronic shortage of food inspectors at the FDA and the Department of Agriculture, said Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University. Now morale is low, experienced inspectors are retiring or leaving for the private sector, and the people who remain are overextended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The staffing losses and the brain drain is huge,” said Sorscher. “The inspection is only as good as the person doing it, and we’re losing so many experienced staff.” The FDA food inspection workforce is about 20% understaffed, with 470 out of a ceiling of 589 positions filled, the agency told consumer groups last week. The infant formula team has only 5 inspector positions filled out of 10, though there are 11 traditional inspectors who can also examine facilities. There’s no hiring freeze on inspectors — the problem is recruiting and retaining staff.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The FDA reassured consumer groups that current staffing was adequate in spite of being below the budgeted ceiling, Sorscher said. “No specifics really, just seemed like they were trying to keep a stiff upper lip for external partners,” she added.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In her own view, “[e]ven if they’re able to bring in new people, it’s going to take years to have the level of competency we had before Trump took office.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ProPublica reported last month that, in the aftermath of support staff cuts, the FDA will have the &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/foreign-food-safety-inspections-historic-low-fda" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lowest number of inspections of imported food&lt;/a&gt; since 2011, excluding the pandemic. “That’s particularly concerning,” Kowalcyk said, because a lot of fruits and vegetables are imported into the U.S., and “fresh produce is our riskiest product” when it comes to foodborne illness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imported foods “don’t have the same level of regulation when it comes to things like irrigation water and food safety practices,” Kowalcyk said. Back in 2008, for example, a nationwide salmonella outbreak that led to hundreds of hospitalizations and two deaths was eventually traced back to contaminated irrigation water used to &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1005741" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;grow peppers&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Food safety experts also predict pipeline problems for years to come as students who might normally seek out jobs in government look for private sector roles instead. “If a student were to come to me today to say, ‘Hey, I’m considering a career in the federal government in food safety,’ I might say, ‘Maybe not right now,’” said Don Schaffner, a distinguished professor of food science at Rutgers University. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brain drain among food safety experts at the CDC is underway as well. That’s a problem because state health departments rely on the CDC to identify and manage responses to foodborne illness that affects people across state lines, according to Medus of the Minnesota foodborne diseases unit. “With a decrease in expertise and capacity at the CDC, it will be harder to coordinate the investigation efforts across the U.S.,” and harder to arrive at answers about the root cause of outbreaks, Medus said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jernigan also noted that DOGE cut a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/orr/topics-programs/orise-fellowship.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC fellowship program&lt;/a&gt; with the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education that provided training to young people who often went on to become junior employees at the agency, including in food safety. “It was a significant cut to the incoming pipeline for young scientists, and I think we’ll be feeling that impact for years,” Jernigan said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The entire staff of 40 or so people in the CDC’s Washington office, which coordinated communication between the agency and Congress, also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/11/cdc-firings-government-shutdown-hhs/"&gt;lost their jobs&lt;/a&gt; in October. That means policymakers on appropriation and oversight committees may not be getting the information they need about outbreaks and other issues, Jernigan said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-funding-cuts-are-weakening-food-safety"&gt;How funding cuts are weakening food safety&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State health departments do most of the initial work on foodborne illness, but they’re heavily dependent on CDC funding. It’s hard to lay out exactly how those cuts have impacted state food safety efforts, said Sorscher, because states’ work is largely funded through federal block grants that can be allocated for a wide range of purposes. “Those grants have decreased dramatically and they’ve probably had to make layoffs, but we can’t really follow the money,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One change that Jernigan said has definitely weakened the food safety system is the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/26/trump-pulls-back-billions-covid-funding-local-health-departments/"&gt;rescission of Covid-related funding&lt;/a&gt; and the fallout effect on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/advanced-molecular-detection/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Advanced Molecular Detection&lt;/a&gt;, a CDC program that allows state health departments to use newer genomic sequencing techniques rather than older methods of microbiology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For foodborne illness, that could mean that when a sick person shows up at the hospital and their stool sample tests positive for salmonella, the sample then gets sent to a state public health laboratory to sequence that particular bacteria. Two weeks later, if someone in another state gets sick, the sequencing would be able to identify a match between the two cases and, from there, help investigators more speedily identify the source of contamination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The taking back of those dollars meant that they no longer had money in state health departments to pay for the people doing the sequencing,” Jernigan said. As a result, he said, “what you will see is later detection of outbreaks, and probably larger numbers of cases.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-we-ll-know-if-the-food-safety-system-is-breaking-down"&gt;How we’ll know if the food safety system is breaking down&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One challenge with communicating the importance of food safety, said Kowalcyk, is that it’s fundamentally about prevention. “If we’re doing our jobs right, you don’t ever see it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may be hard to see the impact of cuts, too. “If you stop looking for things, then you will not find them,” said Jernigan. “Your overall foodborne illness rate will start going down. Yay! No, that’s bad.” Fewer outbreaks, with larger numbers of cases, could be one sign of worsening food safety. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond foodborne illness, a side effect of the cuts may be to discourage Americans from eating fresh food. “If we have a lot of fresh produce outbreaks, that’s going to reduce consumer confidence,” Kowalcyk said. Ultra-processed foods, by contrast, “tend to be pretty safe because they’ve had preservatives added to them and are shelf-stable.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, experts said, food safety and nutrition go hand in hand. “We’re supposedly trying to make America healthy again,” said Schaffner. “And that’s hard to do without people that understand food safety.” &lt;/p&gt;

In a sense, she already knew: She had diagnosed herself with topical steroid withdrawal in 2012, and had gone on to become the president and executive director of a TSW advocacy group. But many doctors weren’t convinced the disorder existed, and as far as Barta could tell, most researchers didn’t care enough to dig into it. The fact that the biggest funder of biomedical research in the world was even trying to decipher its biology felt like a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It had started with eczema when she was a child in Grand Rapids, Mich.: itchy patches in the creases behind her knees and elbows, which spread to her hands and face when she became a preteen. Her doctors managed it with moisturizers and topical steroids. That worked, but over the years, the strength of her steroid prescriptions crept upward — and one day, when she was in her late 30s, working as a musician in Atlanta, a pharmacist casually mentioned that she should be careful, these were really potent steroids, how long had she been taking this sort of stuff? Probably around 10 years, Barta replied. “Just for a second, her eyes kind of popped open, and she got this look on her face, and it made me sick to my stomach,” Barta said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When she did stop her steroids, what had been patches of eczema here and there morphed. Now, she burned everywhere, a redness that covered almost her entire body. She was beset by a new itch, different from an eczema itch, a “bone-deep itch” rather than a superficial one. “An itch like a panic attack, an itch so intense you can’t think of anything, you literally want to claw your skin off, you don’t care if it’s bleeding. It’s indescribable,” Barta said. Her clawed-at skin oozed. She would lie naked on towels, peeling her crusted self off to take a bath every two hours. It hurt to wear clothes. It hurt to move. She couldn’t sleep. She tried the breathing exercises she’d used to get through childbirth. This lasted for years. Eventually, her 21-year marriage fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Early on, in a moment of sleepless Googling, she had stumbled on the term “topical steroid withdrawal,” or TSW. “It was like check, check, check, checking the boxes,” she said. “Even though it was a horrible realization, I just knew that was me. It all clicked into place.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The underlying biology, though, was a mystery. The ailment was defined by symptoms and stories. Some dermatologists were skeptical. They thought it might just be eczema, roaring back with a vengeance when someone stopped treatment. That drove the TSW community up the wall: They had lived with eczema, they knew what it felt like, this felt different. Other physicians worried that these activists were scaring patients away from medications that could be enormously helpful. Activists retorted that they weren’t against steroids, just against their wanton use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Into this disputed terrain stepped Ian Myles, an allergist-immunologist at the NIH. The vast majority of the agency’s $48 billion annual &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/organization/budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;budget&lt;/a&gt; is sent out to researchers elsewhere, but about 11% stays in house, funding research on the campus itself. Myles ran one of those intramural government labs. He was the person who’d invited Barta to Bethesda, Md., to give little hole-punches of her forearms, swabs of her microbiome, and vials of her blood — to be both a research participant and a co-author. When their study of some three-dozen people &lt;a href="https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(25)00014-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;came out in August 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the patient community saw it as a triumph: the first preliminary glimmer of evidence that TSW might be microbiologically distinct — something you could one day test for. Certain other researchers weren’t so sure. Critiques came from both TSW skeptics and TSW allies, a disagreement about how best to probe the unknown when that unknown was tearing apart people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What both sides could agree on was that these questions needed more research. But by the time his initial study came out, Myles had already set aside the follow-up trial he’d planned. Last February, in the name of cost efficiency, the Trump administration had &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-credit-card-freeze-sparks-alarm-health-agencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;frozen&lt;/a&gt; the credit cards government scientists use to purchase lab supplies. By spring, there had been several rounds of mass federal layoffs; employees who’d previously helped with fiddly tasks were gone. Administrative requirements began taking longer. Myles wasn’t angry, just matter-of-fact about the fluctuations of his job. He didn’t want to start enrolling patients if he was uncertain about his ability to follow through. He put the study on indefinite pause. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In federal bureaucracy jargon, the term for a layoff is a “reduction in force.” It’s easy to make an acronym of it, a RIF, and pay little attention to the words themselves. But they capture the results of what has happened this year within government agencies: not only the loss of personnel but also the various disruptions to business as usual. Some argue this is a necessary correction to a bloated ecosystem. But it comes at a cost: offices and labs more limited in what they can accomplish, their forces reduced. While the sweeping termination of NIH grants to external scientists has sparked lawsuits to stop them and databases to track them, these diminished internal abilities have drawn less notice. To TSW patients, though, they’re no less maddening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myles hadn’t meant to study TSW. The whole saga started in 2019, when he happened to hear Barta speak at a Food and Drug Administration event, designed so that skin researchers could learn from patient perspectives. “I had never heard of it in my entire medical training. Initially, it sounded insane,” he said. But when he looked online, he noticed a discrepancy: posts about #topicalsteroidwithdrawal with hundreds of millions of views, but not much in the way of microbiological research. “Whatever was going on, there wasn’t a mountain of evidence &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; these people, right?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Getting-biopsied-at-NIH-May-23-2023.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Getting-biopsied-at-NIH-May-23-2023-1024x1665.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-1416241" srcset="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Getting-biopsied-at-NIH-May-23-2023-1024x1665.jpeg 1024w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Getting-biopsied-at-NIH-May-23-2023-328x533.jpeg 328w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Getting-biopsied-at-NIH-May-23-2023-768x1249.jpeg 768w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Getting-biopsied-at-NIH-May-23-2023-500x813.jpeg 500w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Getting-biopsied-at-NIH-May-23-2023-640x1041.jpeg 640w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Getting-biopsied-at-NIH-May-23-2023-354x576.jpeg 354w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Getting-biopsied-at-NIH-May-23-2023.jpeg 1284w" sizes="(min-width: 625px) and (max-width: 767px) 719px, (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 899px) 835px, (min-width: 900px) and (max-width: 1023px) 635px, (min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1199px) 803px, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1439px) 994px, (min-width: 1440px) 982px, 576px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Myles takes a skin biopsy from Barta’s forearm as part of his study at NIH.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Courtesy Kelly Barta&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, he wasn’t the researcher they were looking for. He had other projects to tend to. He was interested in rising eczema prevalence. Among American children, it had &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2801443" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;jumped from 7.9% to 12.6% between 1997 and 2018&lt;/a&gt;. That had deep implications. Dermatologic health is a bellwether for our relationship with the outside world. It underpins the comfort that allows us to be functional, but also hints at other bodily goings-on — and childhood eczema is among the biggest predictors of food allergies. Unlocking the driver of these rashes might help explain our age of hypersensitivities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Myles suspected that the root of the problem lay in pollutants, toxins, and detergents disrupting our microbiomes, and he was busy looking into that hypothesis, swabbing skin to see what bacteria were living on it, spraying on different species to see if that might help. He was speaking at an eczema conference about that work in 2022 when Barta came up to him; he recognized her as “that lady with TSW.” She said she wanted to meet with NIH officials about organizing research into TSW. He put her in touch with government employees involved in underwriting skin studies, who in turn referred her to a network of NIH-funded dermatologic researchers at various universities — a kind of royal court of American eczema scientists. Initially, their response was encouraging. “I gave them a whole presentation, and they’re like, ‘Oh yeah, this is really compelling,’” Barta recalled. “They ended up publishing a paper calling for more research.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the research itself — the nitty-gritty microbiological study that Barta was waiting for — never came.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It became painfully obvious that every lab that had the resources to do this work did not have the interest to do it,” said Myles. There was a pattern there. The contestedness of a contested illness can feel like a trap, gripping tighter the more you try to extricate yourself. With no official diagnostic criteria, some doctors aren’t sure there’s a diagnosis there at all. But the research that might help establish diagnostic criteria depends on a certain level of recognition: not only an openness to the idea, but a conviction that this is worth spending precious time and funding on. For patients, that creates a catch-22. The less they’re listened to, the more insistent they become, and the more insistent they become, the less doctors are inclined to listen. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;More in American Science, Shattered&lt;/h2&gt;
			
		&lt;/aside&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Nothing is being done, and then they get angry, and then there are echoes of less scientifically grounded arguments,” Myles said. “When they start saying, ‘the pharmaceutical companies are corrupting medicine,’ or ‘the FDA isn’t really doing anything to try to help us,’ or ‘everybody’s just out for the money and covering their butt,’ you start to hear echoes of chem trails and whatever. But that’s not them, right? They’re making good points.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He didn’t think there was some profit-motivated Big Pharma cover-up. Steroids were old drugs, patents long since expired, now sold as cheap generics. Yes, they were prescribed often, and companies got revenue from them. To him, the denials and dismissals likely had a simpler, less nefarious explanation: experts’ fear of not knowing, of having been wrong, of having potentially caused harm, of going against the professional grain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On TSW social media, you could see that some people, frustrated with mainstream medicine, had turned elsewhere, willing to try anything. Had anyone tried CBD? Had anyone tried fasting? What about ivermectin? Red-light therapy? Restricting water intake and moisturizer use? What about one specific clinic in Thailand offering cold atmospheric plasma? A possible association with the fringes didn’t exactly draw researchers in. Barta had heard from one doctor who’d backed off from publishing on TSW because she didn’t want to cloud her kid’s future in dermatology. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Myles was freer from those sorts of pressures than most. As an intramural NIH researcher, his lab had an annual budget. While every project still had to go through multiple approvals, he wasn’t fighting to convince reviewers that an idea was worth funding. Plus, he wasn’t a dermatologist. “I’m not in their pecking order,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nor was he afraid of scientific conflict. In 2023, he’d self-published a book about “how population genetics failed the populace.” In both the academic press and on YouTube, he has called out specific other researchers for what he sees as scientific racism. “Keep in mind, I’m a guy who’s busy spraying people with bacteria to try to treat their skin disease, so everybody knows this guy does things a little differently,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the royal court of American eczema research wouldn’t take this on, Myles thought, he might just do a little study himself. When he wrote to Barta about the idea, she began to cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steroids-world-war-ii-and-a-medical-mystery-nbsp"&gt;Steroids, World War II, and a medical mystery &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The race to develop steroids began as a matter of national security. In 1929, rheumatologist Philip Hench &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26611547/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; that patients’ arthritis improved dramatically when they became sick with jaundice. Something similar happened, he observed, when patients experienced pregnancy or surgery — as if the body, under stress, was producing its own inflammation-fighting elixir. “Substance x,” Hench called it. The hypothesis he and chemist Edward Kendall hit on were hormones produced by the adrenal glands, which perch on the kidneys like little woolen hats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it was World War II that transformed this research into an urgent patriotic quest. Rumor had it that the Nazis were importing cow glands by the submarineful from Argentina; there were fears of Luftwaffe pilots, hormone-boosted to withstand higher altitudes. Apocryphal as such stories might’ve been, American science would not be outdone. When the National Research Council set priorities for government-funded wartime research, one was understanding what Hench had called “Substance x.” By 1944, a candidate had been synthesized from ox bile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The war ended. The portfolio of studies jump-started for military ends was transferred to the burgeoning NIH, part of a plan to make the U.S. into a biomedical mecca — economic and technological dominance driven by nerds. Like many other wartime discoveries, corticosteroids had a peacetime use. When the stuff was injected into rheumatoid arthritis patients, the results seemed nothing short of magical. In 1949, there was a presentation at the Mayo Clinic with motion pictures: “On the screen the gathering saw fourteen men and women, some bedridden, some in wheel chairs, stiff of joint and ridden with pain, get up and walk briskly,” The New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1949/04/21/archives/aid-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-is-promised-by-new-hormone-hormone-is.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. One man — previously too tender to be touched — had improved “to the point where he could dance a jig.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patients clamored for cortisone. There were competing patent claims. A black market emerged. But the magic was short-lived: The first patient who’d gotten treated soon found herself in a locked psychiatric ward, at turns depressed, euphoric, and psychotic. It’s a pharmacologic tenet: What separates remedy from poison is simply a matter of use and dose. Corticosteroids are a prime example. They can quell allergic reactions, soothe rashes, curb asthma attacks, quiet the nausea of chemo, forestall organ rejection, pause the autoimmune disintegration of the colon in Crohn’s disease and of the joints in lupus — and plenty more. But with prolonged systemic exposure, the side effects are just as varied, increasing risks musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, gastric, psychiatric, and ophthalmological. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;By the 1960s, the public had gotten so spooked about the potential dangers of corticosteroids that a whole group of commonly used drugs — which includes aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen — was &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25064056/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; “nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,” specifically so people wouldn’t fear them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TSW slotted uncomfortably into this history. Steroids are a double-edged sword, but topical formulations are more localized and generally considered safer. Though there had been TSW-like case reports for decades, questions about safe dermatologic use burst into the public consciousness care of TikTok and Instagram. Some doctors warned of “steroid phobia,” which the patient community hated, because it suggested wariness about these drugs was unfounded, even pathological. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The answer for those patients is clearly not more steroids. That’s what’s so frustrating to me,” said Peter Lio, a dermatologist at Northwestern University who both incorporates alternative practices like acupuncture into his practice and has &lt;a href="https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/physician/21983" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; payments from makers of newer, nonsteroidal topical drugs. Even before his name got around as the doctor to see if you have TSW — before people began to fly from New York, California, France, and New Zealand to see him, before he was even sure he believed in the diagnosis — he thought these patients had been through a vicious cycle of overuse: Eczema not responding well to treatment, doctors prescribing more and stronger courses. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, though he knew some colleagues disagreed, he realized this didn’t really look like eczema to him. These people had “red-sleeve sign,” as if their arms had been uniformly and deeply sunburned right up to a line at their wrist. They had “elephant skin,” parts of them thickened and wrinkled like a pachyderm. They had “headlight sign,” their faces affected but for a patch around their nose and upper lip. Their temperatures were dysregulated, their lymph nodes swollen, their skin flaking like crazy. “Patients refer to it as snow,” Lio said. “They sweep it up and bring me bags of it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were overlaps with other dermatologic conditions, but also what seemed to some like weird particularities. The explanation, though, remained unclear. As drugs, corticosteroids were an external reproduction of our bodies’ own fight-or-flight chemicals. They constricted blood vessels — and so stopping them might trigger a violent rebound dilation that didn’t stop when it should. Long-term use might be causing steroid tolerance, or throwing specific receptors out of whack, or impairing the skin’s ability to function as a barrier, which in turn triggered an inflammatory Rube Goldberg machine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://www.annallergy.org/article/S1081-1206(23)01507-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;perspective paper&lt;/a&gt; from 2024 explained, even the most basic information was still uncertain. There was no diagnostic smoking gun doctors could use to be sure something was TSW. Risk factors included at least six months — but more often, over a year — of “inappropriate” medium- or high-potency steroid use, especially in sensitive areas like the face or genitals, though patients might quibble with some of those details. Prevalence was unknown. Onset was variable, ranging from days to months after stopping steroids. Prognosis, too, was unpredictable, with symptoms lasting months to years. It was unclear why some minority of patients got this and others didn’t, why flare-ups could differ from person to person, or what might actually help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was a private Facebook support group with some 27,000 members, though it was possible that some subset of those members in fact had something else. Still, it was clear that these patients were suffering. Some sequestered themselves in other rooms, hoping to spare their spouses the presence of so much agony. More than anything, they wanted these symptoms to end. But they also wanted recognition of what they were going through. On both fronts, some biological signature — a small step toward a test for TSW — could help. That was what Myles was hoping to find. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-searching-for-the-biology-of-tsw-nbsp"&gt;Searching for the biology of TSW &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea was to bring three different groups of patients to the NIH — 16 with TSW, 10 with plain old eczema, and 11 healthy volunteers — and then run a battery of tests on their blood and skin to see if there was something that set TSW apart. In some analyses, those with TSW and those with eczema looked similar. Compared with the healthy volunteers, the swabs from both groups showed higher populations of Staphylococcus aureus and lower bacterial diversity, the skin biopsies showed more of the T cells and macrophages one might expect to see in a place with inflammation, and the serum samples showed the interleukins that help coordinate that sort of immune response. These bodies were all riled up, as if under attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What differed, though, between the two skin-disease groups appeared when Myles’ team looked at other molecules present in the skin biopsies. The TSW patients had abnormally high levels of vitamin B3, or niacin, and abnormally low levels of tryptophan, their paper reported. One possible explanation lay in the mitochondria, the tiny powerhouses of our cells, performing the daily alchemy of transmuting nutrients and oxygen into energy, which included breaking down tryptophan and producing niacin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To Myles and Nadia Shobnam, the first author of the paper, it looked like a specific bit of mitochondrial machinery was overactive in TSW. That also jibed with an idea that was already in the scientific literature. When niacin was first used as an oral drug to fight cholesterol in the 1950s, it was limited by an uncomfortable side effect of making patients flush, their skin red, warm, and sometimes itchy — not so different from one common complaint in TSW. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the study didn’t stop there. A colleague of Myles’ had casually mentioned that metformin, a common diabetes drug, blocked the specific bit of mitochondrial machinery they thought was working overtime, and an herbal supplement called berberine — “nature’s Ozempic,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/berberine-social-media-trend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; fad — had a similar chemical effect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Myles wasn’t about to turn this pilot study into a randomized controlled trial of these compounds, but he told the participants who had TSW that they could try either of these substances on their own, and that if they did, he wanted to hear how their symptoms changed. Based on lab analyses, he helped counsel patients about which berberine vendors were actually selling what they said they were; otherwise, to him, they might as well be trying sawdust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three patients got metformin prescriptions from their doctors, nine ordered berberine online, and within three to five months, they tended to report improvements in the “bone-deep itch” and some clearance of their rashes, though their TSW still sometimes flared up occasionally. These results might be attributable to the placebo effect; after all, these patients’ experiences were being compared to the expected course of TSW — hardly the level of evidence doctors hope for when considering a therapy. Still, it seemed worth a shot; the TSW community was desperate. When the manuscript was ready, it contained, along with graphs and signaling-pathway charts, a few before-and-after photos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-default"&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thank-you-for-giving-us-credibility"&gt;‘Thank you for giving us credibility’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a patient community feels ignored and gaslit by the institutions of medicine, and members of those institutions worry that patient stories aren’t entirely reliable as data, pressure builds. Every study becomes a battleground. In April 2024, Myles’ team &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.17.24305846v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; the paper on a preprint server, not yet peer-reviewed. In early May, Myles &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSFiKlrIDUI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;broke down&lt;/a&gt; the results for patients on YouTube. In the comments section, the relief was palpable. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As someone who has been going through TSW, this study has been an incredible gift, and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. We have so much more work to do, but you just opened the door to let other reputable people such as yourself take this topic seriously,” one person wrote.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Thank you for giving us credibility and proof of our condition,” wrote another. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other researchers weren’t convinced this paper counted as proof, though, once it &lt;a href="https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(25)00014-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;came out&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology in August 2025. To some, there was a gnarly old problem of diagnostic criteria. Though Myles had established a framework for how many symptoms a patient had to have to qualify for participation, the symptoms remained self-reported. “How do you know you are describing the same condition?” asked Eugene Tan, a dermatologist at the University of New South Wales, in Australia, who &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40696952/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;coauthored&lt;/a&gt; a critique of the paper. He worried that the criteria were based on a survey done by the International Topical Steroid Awareness Network, the patient advocacy group that Barta had led, and that without a less subjective diagnosis, the study results didn’t mean much. “How do you know that these patients are not primed to say stuff you want them to say? In court, you’d say, ‘leading question, your honor.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The first thing I would like is for it to be determined whether topical steroid withdrawal exists in the first place,” he added in an email. He didn’t mean to dismiss the experience of TSW sufferers, but to him, compliance was the Achilles’ heel of any topical treatment, making it tough to differentiate between TSW and eczema that was poorly controlled by a drug not being taken as directed; he has eczema himself and knows how difficult such regimens are to keep. Before anything, he wanted to see a study chronicling the natural history of eczema when investigators are monitoring how and when patients apply creams. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two researchers in the U.K., meanwhile, wrote a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40480485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt; from the opposite perspective. They trusted TSW patient experiences, but they worried that this NIH study oversold its results and that the evidence for mitochondrial involvement remained “speculative.” Myles and Shobnam &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40562352/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; in print, claiming the letter writers had misunderstood the technical details they were picking apart. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beneath this back-and-forth lay the very murk that scared some researchers away from this topic in the first place. Designing a TSW study could be a high-stakes puzzle; satisfying both those agnostic to whether the condition is real and those who are suffering from it was unlikely if not impossible. The combination of patient desperation and lack of scientific interest meant that there was a risk for any finding to be seen as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; answer, case closed, rather than one small step in an iterative accumulation of evidence. That was the irony. Though they disagreed about what it might look like, every side in the dispute about Myles’ study wanted the same thing: more research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-frozen-credit-cards-layoffs-shifting-priorities"&gt;Frozen credit cards, layoffs, shifting priorities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That had been Myles’ plan. In January 2025, even before the paper had officially come out, he was ready to request approval for a bigger berberine trial. It would’ve involved around100 people. But then, under the Trump 2.0 mandate for a slimmer, more “efficient” federal apparatus, the credit cards NIH workers used to buy supplies were temporarily frozen. Getting berberine, biopsy punches, microbiome swabs, and chemicals for molecular tests would have to wait. Plus, some of the employees involved in purchasing had left or been laid off. “When they told us, ‘OK, you can purchase now,’ you’re like, how? And so then we all had to file for what we call purchase cards. And that took several months,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These slowdowns weren’t the only reason Myles set aside his next TSW study. In October, Shobnam, the initial paper’s first author, left the NIH for personal reasons, not political ones, with the idea of potentially collecting samples from her TSW patients in New Jersey and sending them back to her old place of work for analysis. But that wasn’t certain. “My new job is purely clinical, and I haven’t had any time for research yet,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TSW was also a side project for Myles. His main research on environmental factors and eczema dovetailed with what he saw as the priorities laid out under health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He doesn’t blame the new administration or take it personally. It would not have been impossible for him to pursue more TSW research; it just would’ve been slower. With competing demands on his time, he chose the sort of science he was best at, uncertain that whatever would emerge from the follow-up trial he’d planned would warrant the hurdles involved. “The juice-to-squeeze ratio has shifted,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He’s philosophical about the fact that this is the nature of his job as a government scientist. Priorities change. Cancer moonshots come and go. Agency budgets fluctuate. Staffing numbers rise and fall. “If Secretary Kennedy came down and said, ‘Oh my God, I can’t believe a pharmaceutical is doing all this, we’ve got to research this, give this man $10 million and go do it,’ I’m not going to tell him no,” Myles said. “So I have to deal with the reality of the flip side of that. If they want to make it harder to do research, that’s also part of our existence. The administration’s priorities change, and we adapt. But it is true that part of the adaptation in this particular case is that we just can’t commit to starting an entire trial again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To a mind bent on smaller government, such refocusing might be a cause for celebration. It’s not as though all TSW research would stop. The two U.K. researchers who’d critiqued Myles’ study were &lt;a href="https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN49789010" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recruiting&lt;/a&gt; patients to try to look for biological patterns among this patient population. They would be taking saliva samples in addition to skin and blood, to figure out whether long-term topical steroids had suppressed the body’s own production of such chemicals, which might be at the root of some of these symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Barta has, herself, a healthy suspicion of the federal bureaucracy. She’d long thought that agencies needed to be better held accountable to taxpayers. But as someone who’d spent years pushing to understand TSW, this slowdown in Myles’ lab felt like a blow. “I understand the need for a shake-up,” she said, “but it really has set things back and pushed pause and been super frustrating.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The steroids at the center of the whole controversy had emerged from a sense that biomedical science was a patriotic public good — a boon for the war effort and for the U.S. as a whole. That in turn became a midcentury surge in research, symbolized by the behemoth that is the NIH. Knowledge production, the thinking went, could boost economies, create jobs, reduce illness, and lengthen lives. In this grand sweep, a relatively small berberine trial for a potentially rare illness may seem insignificant. The supplement was hardly the surefire cure that the TSW community was hoping for, according to those who’d tried it. Yet these ongoing steroidal questions, some 75 years after these drugs were introduced, are just one example of how science builds upon itself — and of what might be lost in weakening the structure that undergirds it. Even Myles’ critics worry about the loss of momentum that his scrapped protocol represents. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s really quite sad, because science is just a tool to find the truth. Someone needed to publish this, and someone needed to critique it,” said Tan, of Myles’ initial study. The issues he’d raised were not an admonishment to stop but a reason to keep going, to look deeper. “Hopefully, he’ll respond by saying, ‘I am going to validate this, I am going to prove you wrong.’ I hope he succeeds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that day, at the &lt;a href="https://www.ctad-alzheimer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CtAD 2025&lt;/a&gt; meeting (CtAD stands for Clinical Trials in Alzheimer’s Disease), in the Sapphire Ballroom of the Hilton San Diego Bayfront hotel, Novo Nordisk would present to the assembly of scientists and biopharma executives the results of its &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04777409" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;EVOKE studies&lt;/a&gt;, two clinical trials testing whether semaglutide can treat people with early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. Semaglutide is, of course, the chemical name for the brand Ozempic, &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2023/209637s020s021lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;FDA labeled&lt;/a&gt; for the treatment of diabetes and to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, but widely known as &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/05/weight-loss-drugs-changing-obesity-narrative/?utm_campaign=morning_rounds&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9KN2JWKLzSKiD7sRYCvdv-qYG-yk9UCPvkV3ORcAgdmFdtdf46SeUuHJcZJaT7a6jmAsAL0zy2b-nIDUdeiHmTt0Zf7FMIVJG0lSw8-VBaDjhZ_IQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=389884444&amp;amp;utm_content=389884444&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;a drug for obesity&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

Their high efficacy and favorable safety profiles have made them essential in the management of potentially life-threatening conditions, including &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/181753-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;peptic ulcer disease&lt;/a&gt; and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their established role, PPI have been increasingly &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ajg/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2019&amp;amp;issue=02000&amp;amp;article=00017&amp;amp;type=Abstract" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;portrayed as harmful&lt;/a&gt;. Claims in both the scientific literature and general media have raised concerns about possible long-term adverse effects. This perception has become widespread, leading nearly 40% of individuals to discontinue PPI, most without informing their clinician, primarily because of the fear of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clinicians, the growing disconnect between evidence and perceptions has practical consequences. Distinguishing between speculative associations, confirmed adverse effects, and inappropriate prescriptions is essential to ensure rational use and maintain patient confidence in effective therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associations Without Proven Causality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the criticism directed at PPI in recent years has been based on retrospective studies, linking their use to outcomes such as dementia, fractures, kidney disease, and &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/278744-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;gastric cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most instances, these findings represent &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apt.13324" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;statistical associations&lt;/a&gt; rather than causal relationships and are strongly influenced by confounding factors, including advanced age, polypharmacy, and underlying comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their potent acid-suppressive effects are associated with &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apt.13324" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;structural and functional changes&lt;/a&gt; in the gastric mucosa, including enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apt.13800" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;fundic gland&lt;/a&gt; polyps. Evidence indicates that these findings are largely benign and do not warrant specific endoscopic surveillance in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association between PPI and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/6605024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;gastric cancer&lt;/a&gt; was initially suggested in studies published over a decade ago. However, subsequent meta-analyses have questioned these findings, highlighting the potential methodological biases. These include the failure to account for &lt;em&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/em&gt; infection, a &lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(16)30205-1/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;well-established&lt;/a&gt; and independent &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/55/11/1538" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;gastric carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defined Risks, Limited Magnitude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some adverse effects that are clearly associated with PPI use have been well described. The risk for &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ajg/abstract/2012/07000/risk_ofclostridium_difficileinfection_with_acid.11.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; infection increased modestly, with an odds ratio of 1.74 (95% CI, 1.47-2.85; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001). This risk is higher in hospitalized individuals and those receiving concurrent antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0024320518308592?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;osteoporosis and fractures&lt;/a&gt; is a frequently cited concern. Meta-analyses confirm a small increase in risk, with a relative risk of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.16-1.45). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is no convincing evidence of a clinically relevant long-term effect of PPI on &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(09)02030-7/fulltext?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;bone metabolism&lt;/a&gt; in humans. These findings suggest that residual confounding factors, such as frailty or advanced age, may account for much of the observed associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns regarding the interaction with &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1007964" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;clopidogrel now appear&lt;/a&gt; to be largely resolved. Randomized clinical trials have not shown an increased incidence of cardiovascular events in patients treated with PPI. Pharmacokinetic interactions are primarily limited to &lt;a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/prilosec-omeprazole-341997" class="cl_ref_drugs"&gt;omeprazole&lt;/a&gt; and can be avoided by using alternative agents such as &lt;a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/prevacid-solu-tab-lansoprazole-341991" class="cl_ref_drugs"&gt;lansoprazole&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/aciphex-rabeprazole-342002" class="cl_ref_drugs"&gt;rabeprazole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Central Issue: Inappropriate Prescribing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most tangible and clinically relevant risk associated with PPI use is their unnecessary prolonged use. Treatment should be reviewed periodically, particularly after the eradication of &lt;em&gt;H pylori&lt;/em&gt; infection or the discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When no clear ongoing indication exists, gradual dose reduction or withdrawal should be considered to minimize the risk for rebound acid hypersecretion following &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(09)00522-8/fulltext?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;abrupt discontinuation&lt;/a&gt;. Deprescribing should not be understood as depriving patients of effective therapies. Rather, it should reflect an ongoing individual assessment of benefits and risks over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PPI remains one of the most reliable pillars of digestive therapies. Their introduction has fundamentally altered clinical outcomes, prognosis, and mortality in conditions that, until recently, lacked effective treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portraying these drugs as inherently dangerous risks causes more harm than benefit by fostering fear and undermining trust in life-saving interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The priority should not be restriction driven by media alarm, but to ensure that each prescription is clinically justified with an appropriate duration and responsible follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conflicts of interest of the authors of the cited studies are available in their original publications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was translated from&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.univadis.es/viewarticle/inhibidores-bomba-protones-un-riesgo-real-2025a1000y09" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Univadis Spain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, part of the Medscape Professional Network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 07:30:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNVWkzZDVzb2tINlowMHZCTkp3QVdvVVl2UWR5UnlzWGV4cndDdGpMc0lveWtfSVl1bElpVlMzMVFPMGRhT3VJb1VoNmh3bk5SVzAwbVBqcHZSVWdXQVVodEZlaWVSQ2ZSaTA4RnNreGpJQkd0aGVsRW1TWkZoNmxWT0hUTzI2UXctTkZqenRxS3V3NzI1VTY3N0FXVmptN3hKQXQw</guid></item><item><title>帕金森的突破改变了我们对多巴胺的了解- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251221043225.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;A new study led by researchers at McGill University is calling into question a long-standing idea about how dopamine influences movement. The findings suggest a shift in how scientists understand Parkinson's disease and how its treatments work.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, shows that dopamine does not directly control how fast or how forcefully a person moves, as many experts previously believed. Instead, dopamine appears to provide the basic conditions that allow movement to happen in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest we should rethink dopamine's role in movement," said senior author Nicolas Tritsch, Assistant Professor in McGill's Department of Psychiatry and researcher at the Douglas Research Centre. "Restoring dopamine to a normal level may be enough to improve movement. That could simplify how we think about Parkinson's treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Dopamine Does in Parkinson's Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine plays a key role in motor vigor, which refers to the ability to move with speed and strength. In people with Parkinson's disease, the brain cells that produce dopamine gradually break down. This loss leads to hallmark symptoms such as slow movement, tremors, and problems with balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levodopa, the most common treatment for Parkinson's, helps restore movement by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. However, scientists have not fully understood why the drug is so effective. In recent years, improved brain-monitoring tools detected brief spikes of dopamine during movement. These rapid bursts led many researchers to think dopamine directly controlled movement intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings challenge that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine Acts as Support, Not a Speed Controller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study suggests dopamine does not act as a moment-by-moment controller of movement. Instead, it serves a more fundamental role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Rather than acting as a throttle that sets movement speed, dopamine appears to function more like engine oil. It's essential for the system to run, but not the signal that determines how fast each action is executed," said Tritsch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking Dopamine in Real Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the researchers monitored brain activity in mice while the animals pressed a weighted lever. Using a light-based method, they were able to switch dopamine-producing cells "on" or "off" during the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If rapid dopamine bursts were responsible for movement vigor, changing dopamine levels at that exact moment should have altered how fast or forcefully the mice moved. Instead, adjusting dopamine activity during movement made no difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers tested levodopa, they found that the drug improved movement by raising the brain's overall dopamine level. It did not work by restoring the short-lived dopamine bursts that occur during motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward More Targeted Parkinson's Treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 110,000 Canadians are currently living with Parkinson's disease, and that number is expected to more than double by 2050 as the population ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, a better understanding of why levodopa works could guide the development of future treatments that focus on maintaining steady dopamine levels rather than targeting rapid dopamine signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings also encourage researchers to reexamine older treatment strategies. Dopamine receptor agonists have shown benefits in the past but often caused side effects because they affected large areas of the brain. The new insight may help scientists design safer therapies that act more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Subsecond dopamine fluctuations do not specify the vigor of ongoing actions" by Haixin Liu and Nicolas Tritsch et al., was published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, awarded through the Healthy Brains, Healthy Lives initiative at McGill University and the Fonds de Recherche du Québec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The study was carried out by scientists from the Federal University of Grande Dourados (UFGD), the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), and São Paulo State University (UNESP).&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph's Coat grows naturally along Brazil's coastline and has long been used in traditional medicine to treat inflammation, infections, and parasitic illnesses. Despite its widespread use, there had been little scientific research confirming whether these benefits were real or whether the plant was safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying Active Compounds and Testing Anti Inflammatory Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Ethnopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;, began with a detailed chemical analysis of the plant. Researchers examined the ethanolic extract made from the plant's aerial parts to determine which bioactive compounds it contained. This phase of the work was led by Marcos Salvador, a pharmacist from the Institute of Biology (IB) at UNICAMP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After identifying the compounds, the research moved to biological testing. A team led by pharmacologist Cândida Kassuya from the Faculty of Health Sciences at UFGD evaluated how well the extract reduced inflammation in experimental models of arthritis. Toxicological testing followed to assess safety. "Finally, we performed the toxicological analyses under my coordination," explains Arielle Cristina Arena, associate professor in the Department of Structural and Functional Biology at the Institute of Biosciences at UNESP's Botucatu Campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laboratory Results Show Reduced Inflammation and Joint Damage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments revealed that the ethanolic extract of A. littoralis significantly lowered inflammation in laboratory animals. "In the experimental models, we observed reduced edema, improved joint parameters, and modulation of inflammatory mediators, suggesting antioxidant and tissue-protective actions," says Arena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that the plant does more than reduce swelling. The results also suggest that it may help protect joint tissue and limit damage associated with inflammatory conditions like arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising Safety Profile With Limits on Immediate Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Arena, the results strengthen the scientific case for the plant's medicinal value and provide a foundation for future preclinical studies. The findings also point to a favorable safety profile at therapeutic doses, which could be encouraging for eventual human use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers caution that the extract is not ready for clinical application. Additional toxicological testing, human clinical trials, and standardized preparation methods are still required to confirm safety, effectiveness, and quality. Regulatory approval would also be necessary before any therapeutic use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting Biodiversity Through Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research is part of an ongoing line of investigation developed by UFGD, UNESP, and UNICAMP, and our purpose is to value Brazilian biodiversity and traditional knowledge, but with a rigorous scientific basis, promoting the safe and rational use of natural products," says Arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research received funding from FAPESP (projects 06/06079-4, 09/05992-6, 15/03726-8, 16/06407-3, 17/19523-4, and 21/09693-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db521.htm"&gt;leading cause of death in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since researchers first established the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14364826/"&gt;link between diet, cholesterol and heart disease in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;, risk for heart disease has been partly assessed based on a patient's cholesterol levels, which can be routinely measured via blood work at the doctor's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.97.20.2007"&gt;accumulating evidence over the past two decades&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates that a biomarker called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/23056-c-reactive-protein-crp-test"&gt;C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt; – which signals the presence of low-grade inflammation – is a better predictor of risk for heart disease than cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-finds-inflammation-could-be-a-core-feature-of-depression"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poor-oral-hygiene-could-be-taking-a-toll-on-your-heart-expert-says"&gt;Poor Oral Hygiene Could Be Taking a Toll on Your Heart, Expert Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, in September 2025, the American College of Cardiology published &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.047"&gt;new recommendations for universal screening of&lt;/a&gt; C-reactive protein levels in all patients, alongside measuring cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186417" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186417" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/GlowyGoldLiverInBlueTorsoOutline.jpg" alt="Glowy gold liver in blue outlined torso" class="wp-image-186417 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/GlowyGoldLiverInBlueTorsoOutline.jpg 683w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/GlowyGoldLiverInBlueTorsoOutline-642x481.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/GlowyGoldLiverInBlueTorsoOutline-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186417" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The liver produces C-reactive protein.

Essentially, it is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2206346"&gt;marker of inflammation&lt;/a&gt; – meaning &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-inflammation-two-immunologists-explain-how-the-body-responds-to-everything-from-stings-to-vaccination-and-why-it-sometimes-goes-wrong-193503"&gt;immune system activation&lt;/a&gt; – in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C-reactive protein can be easily measured with blood work at the doctor's office. A low C-reactive protein level – under 1 milligram per deciliter – signifies minimal inflammation in the body, which is protective against heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elevated C-reactive protein level of greater than 3 milligrams per deciliter, signifies increased levels of inflammation and thus &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11092444"&gt;increased risk for heart disease&lt;/a&gt;. About 52 percent of Americans have an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM200504143521525"&gt;elevated level of C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt; in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that C-reactive protein is a better predictive marker for heart attacks and strokes than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2405182"&gt;"bad," or LDL cholesterol, short for low-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt;, as well as another commonly measured genetically inherited biomarker called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2405182"&gt;lipoprotein(a)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study found that C-reactive protein &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61717-7"&gt;can predict heart disease just as well as blood pressure can&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does inflammation matter in heart disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation plays a crucial role at every stage in the development and buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, which causes a condition called &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; that can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/hc0902.104353"&gt;lead to heart attacks and strokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment a blood vessel is damaged, be it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.71433"&gt;from high blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2613.2000.00162.x"&gt;cigarette smoke&lt;/a&gt;, immune cells immediately infiltrate the area. Those immune cells subsequently engulf cholesterol particles that are typically floating around in the blood stream to form a fatty plaque that resides in the wall of the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-mouth-and-your-heart-are-connected-gum-disease-linked-to-heart-risks"&gt; 'Your Mouth And Your Heart Are Connected': Gum Disease Linked to Heart Risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process continues for decades until eventually, one day, immune mediators rupture the cap that encloses the plaque. This triggers the formation of a blood clot that obstructs blood flow, starves the surrounding tissues of oxygen and ultimately causes a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, cholesterol is only part of the story; it is, in fact, the immune system that facilitates each step in the processes that drive heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can diet influence C-reactive protein levels?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle can significantly influence the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487319885458"&gt;amount of C-reactive protein produced by the liver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous foods and nutrients have been shown to lower C-reactive protein levels, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3109/09637486.2014.959898"&gt;dietary fiber from foods like beans, vegetables, nuts and seeds&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.110922"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2025.2525446"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2019.08.019"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-024-00847-3"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2024.106868"&gt;flaxseeds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.167.1.31"&gt;Weight loss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2016-095999"&gt;and exercise&lt;/a&gt; can also reduce C-reactive protein levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does cholesterol still matter for heart disease risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though cholesterol may not be the most important predictor of risk for heart disease, it does remain highly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's not just the amount of cholesterol – or more specifically the amount of bad, or LDL, cholesterol – that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people with the same cholesterol level don't necessarily have the same risk for heart disease. This is because risk is determined more so by the number of particles that the bad cholesterol is packaged into, as opposed to the total mass of bad cholesterol that's floating around. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.068885"&gt;More particles means higher risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why a blood test known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24992-apolipoprotein-b-test"&gt;apolipoprotein B&lt;/a&gt;, which measures the number of cholesterol particles, is a better predictor of risk for heart disease than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2021.5083"&gt;measurements of total amounts of bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like cholesterol and C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B is also influenced by lifestyle factors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/a-2580-0722"&gt;like exercise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-019-1094-4"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and diet. Nutrients like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954422416000147"&gt;fiber, nuts and omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; are associated with a decreased number of cholesterol particles, while &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9030211"&gt;increased sugar intake is associated with a larger number&lt;/a&gt; of cholesterol particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/genetic-conditions/lipoprotein-a"&gt;lipoprotein(a)&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that lives in the wall surrounding cholesterol particles, is another marker that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/ATV.0000000000000147"&gt;can predict heart disease more accurately than cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;. This is because the presence of lipoprotein(a) makes cholesterol particles sticky, so to speak, and thus more likely to get trapped in an atherosclerotic plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, unlike other risk factors, lipoprotein(a) levels are purely genetic, thus not influenced by lifestyle, and need only be measured once in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-finds-inflammation-could-be-a-core-feature-of-depression"&gt;Huge Study Finds Inflammation Could Be a Core Feature of Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What's the best way to prevent heart disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, heart disease is the product of many risk factors and their interactions over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, preventing heart disease is way more complicated than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/128.2.449S"&gt;simply eating a cholesterol-free diet, as once thought&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing your LDL cholesterol level alongside your C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a) levels paints a comprehensive picture of risk that can hopefully help motivate long-term commitment to the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/how-to-help-prevent-heart-disease-at-any-age"&gt;fundamentals of heart disease prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include eating well, exercising consistently, getting adequate sleep, managing stress productively, maintaining healthy weight and, if applicable, quitting smoking.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271143/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
