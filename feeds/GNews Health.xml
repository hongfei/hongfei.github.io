I’ve been through surgery and radiation treatments. According to the oncologists, I should now consider myself a “survivor.” Since I have scars, I’m taking medication for the next 10 years that has potentially really bad side effects, and the chance of reoccurrence is a definite possibility, I don’t feel like a “survivor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XD4BJ2HF3FBZ5J2CPP5JQHI7O4"&gt; I readily admit that I’m depressed. I maintain that this is a perfectly reasonable reaction to something bad that has upended and changed my whole life for the foreseeable future. I’m not suicidal, and although some mornings are hard, I get up every day, shower, brush my hair and teeth and maintain my usual schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XERLV72NB5EBJH7PYWHXBBWHNQ"&gt; The worst thing to me about cancer is that I can’t talk to anyone because I’ve gone from an actual person with thoughts and interests to people only wanting to know about the cancer. It’s all anyone asks about. That being the case, I tried to talk to people about how I feel, but the word “depressed” freaks people out more than “cancer.” Now I just say I’m fine or OK to make others feel comfortable, which applies to my doctors as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EVCETBQZUBDAVCVRLFHY22F5KE"&gt; I don’t need medication, and I tried online and in-person group discussions a few times, and they aren’t for me. I’ve noticed the same thing with people who lose a loved one or have something else bad happen -- they aren’t allowed to be depressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4KTRIQBNONECLLFFZOFPZ2XSEA"&gt; When did it become shameful and something that needs to be fixed when people have a true human emotion to events? Sad things should understandably make us sad -- and maybe depressed? Please note, I’m not talking about people with real diagnosed clinical depression or other mental issues. -- Sad “Survivor”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NSUUG75AIVF2RC2CHTH3J7C6CE"&gt; Dear Sad “Survivor”: The word “survivor” may sound triumphant, yes, but it doesn’t cancel out the fear, pain and lifelong change you’ve endured to get here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XBLJEFBKRFHXZCPE2QWRGL3XAE"&gt; It is a victory to be where you are today, and there’s nothing troubling about feeling conflicted. What is troubling is feeling you have to hide it -- especially from your doctors, who need the full picture, whether it’s pretty or not. You’re allowed to say, “I’m getting through it, but it’s still hard,” and you deserve people in your corner who can hear that without panicking or minimizing it, no matter how uncomfortable it may make them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AKRN73MG2VE67LXA5ZZLBRXBWA"&gt; Healing doesn’t happen overnight. Give yourself permission to feel whatever comes and ask honestly for the support you need. A survivor isn’t someone who feels strong all the time; it’s someone who keeps going despite hardship. By that measure, you absolutely are one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:SFE3ARRPA5AV7LDCAUW5LN3ZYY" data-fusion-component="SFE3ARRPA5AV7LDCAUW5LN3ZYY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:SFE3ARRPA5AV7LDCAUW5LN3ZYY" data-fusion-component="SFE3ARRPA5AV7LDCAUW5LN3ZYY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KBS5BB2UAFFXZAS3VFHZOZ5FEI"&gt;Dear Annie: After 15 years, my wife says she is filing for divorce. I’m disabled and don’t drive. I work part time and receive disability money. My wife has always helped me get to and from work because I don’t drive myself, and she also handles our bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YY5ND5DMORFBBCNY37KUMJE2JM"&gt; I still love her, and I need to know why she has become so bitter toward me. And why did she wait till now, after I sank so much money into this life we’ve been building? What changed? -- Stunned Spouse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LWPUFL55R5HGLFOQWTESK55EQE"&gt; Dear Stunned Spouse: I’m so sorry. The end of a marriage is always sad, but when you don’t see it coming, it can feel especially blindsiding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4XDI4BKEQBCCLNTPVGL63RHRTE"&gt; Perhaps the question isn’t what suddenly changed but what has built up over a long time. From what you describe, your wife has carried a lot of the day-to-day -- transportation, paying bills, keeping everything afloat -- which can wear a person down. That doesn’t mean this is your fault, but it might explain some of the “bitterness” you’ve picked up on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E7SMOALE6JECLG2L3WDDCOEMCU"&gt; If she’s willing, ask for an honest conversation. You might not be able to change her mind or salvage the relationship, but getting some answers can help you at least make sense of its ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4CW6RMWCIVCHPAVGLW7QR4VF5Q"&gt; In the meantime, focus on building independence where you can -- transportation alternatives, financial management, legal advice. It’s important to start planning how you’ll take care of and protect yourself going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3NZ6WOLDINBPHLN7MMXO3DMGXU"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Send your questions for Annie Lane to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:dearannie@creators.com"&gt;&lt;i&gt;dearannie@creators.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6ECHFSPXGNGLHONECDZRWKCEIY"&gt;COPYRIGHT 2023 &lt;a href="http://creators.com/"&gt;CREATORS.COM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>OregonLive.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 00:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>加拿大神秘脑部疾病之战-英国广播公司</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c623r47d67lo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;'The answer cannot be nothing': The battle over Canada's mystery brain disease&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline" class="sc-573fa0e8-0 bWRWzH"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors" class="sc-573fa0e8-11 cOQNNv"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 ciiGlA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 kdBCdE"&gt;Joel Gunter,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 eDNgSC"&gt;senior international reporter, New Brunswick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-9 keGieE"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-1" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 ciiGlA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 kdBCdE"&gt;Nadine Yousif,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-1-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 eDNgSC"&gt;senior Canada reporter, New Brunswick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5804/live/de44b020-ed77-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5804/live/de44b020-ed77-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5804/live/de44b020-ed77-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5804/live/de44b020-ed77-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5804/live/de44b020-ed77-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5804/live/de44b020-ed77-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5804/live/de44b020-ed77-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5804/live/de44b020-ed77-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Graphic showing a photograph of Dr Marerro against a stylised black, white and yellow background.

What would it mean for the patients if the disease was never real?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In early 2019, officials at a hospital in the small Canadian province of New Brunswick noticed that two patients had contracted an extremely rare brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;CJD is both fatal and potentially contagious, so a group of experts was quickly assembled to investigate. Fortunately for New Brunswick, the disease didn't spread. But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. "I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying," he recalled. "And an image of a cluster became more clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Many of the cluster patients believe industrial poisoning has affected New Brunswick's environment. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Over the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a "house of cards".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was "degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated," said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. "There's all these different levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called "original 48".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps," Lucas recalled. "We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Jillian Lucas and her stepfather Derek Cuthbertson. Both were diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. "He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important," Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was "the only one listening to them," said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He's an incredible human and physician," said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough," Nicholson said. "But he was such a pillar of support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's like reading a movie script," emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We are all in the movie!", a senior federal scientist replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Dr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. "I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying," he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And the mystery disease got a name: the "New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it "one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We all owe you a debt of gratitude," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling "flabbergasted" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a "diarrhea of symptoms".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"All available evidence and logic" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was "not expected to pose risks" to human health or the environment.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. "I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full "boots-on-the-ground" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. "Everybody received that email like a cold shower," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking," Lanteigne said. "Full stop."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Taking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;A protest sign in New Brunswick. Some residents are angry about pesticide use in the province.

The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. "He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero declined to discuss it. "Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. "Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations," wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. "When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum," Lucas said. "And I choose him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Jillian Lucas at home with one of the family's 15 parrots.

Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, "What now?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email," said Lucas. "He just has so many patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that," Strickland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Kevin Strickland at home with his rescue dog. His partner April was diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. "I think I waited four months for that letter," Strickland recalled. "I kept phoning and asking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero "did nothing for April," Strickland said. "I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches and balance issues. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. "It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero," she recalled. "Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. "Those were the words he used," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Sandi Partridge in a park near her home. "It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero," she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms with a psychological root. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero. "As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND," Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. "And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me," she said. "I hit every single marker."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Partridge is now on a multi-faceted FND treatment programme involving neurology, neuropsychology and occupational health. And she is at peace with her diagnosis. "The stigma is difficult," she said, "but I've accepted it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Gabrielle Cormier, the youngest patient in Marrero's cluster, would also receive a diagnosis of FND, but her journey would follow a different path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Cormier has featured heavily in the media coverage of the cluster, becoming a kind of poster child for the mystery disease. She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she "just needed to find a boyfriend", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Gabrielle Cormier was diagnosed by Marrero at just 18. "I've done nothing with my life since I got sick," she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet," stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. "He told her that she wasn't alone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems," said her father Andre, angrily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Global News Jillian Lucas and other patients stand in front of a government building holding signs saying 'We are not a mystery, 'We stand by Doctor Marrero' and other slogans.

Marrero had never crossed "any kind of line," Stacie said. "He's pristine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"That's why all his patients like him," Andre said. "Love him, maybe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Lang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people "co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Dr Lang was the leading author on a paper casting doubt on the cluster.

Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"They are trying to present me as it," he said, dejectedly. "I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. "As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly," he said. "But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Dr Marrero in his home office. "I was part of it, but I was not it," he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;An upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. "Lives hang in the balance," read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. "It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them," the letter said. "Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. "I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families," Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I would even go further," Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. "I would say they are being abused."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It has to be a patient complaint," they said. "And all his patients love him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. "She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom," her stepmother said. "It's a very limited life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero "deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people." But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. "The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Jillian Lucas in her back garden. "I don't want to be in a nursing home, or be a burden," she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Jillian Lucas has now seen a second doctor, but only because she has pushed ahead with her decision to explore medical assistance in dying, which requires two physicians to sign off. Canada has among the world's most permissive laws for assisted dying, allowing people to pursue it without a terminal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When Lucas told Marrero her plan, he became "choked up", she said. "It eats him up, he's fighting back tears."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And yet, Marrero agreed to support her application, despite her not having a concrete diagnosis or testing positive for any known condition. (Marrero told the BBC he "took the utmost care to abide by" the laws around Maid and had "never proposed it" to a patient.) After all the years of uncertainty with the unknown neurological syndrome, the option of dying gave Lucas some sense of control. "I have a limit in my mind of how far I can go," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sitting in his garden office, the sun streaming in, Marrero had no such limits in mind. "I keep going because I know," he said, confidently. He had been able to meet "with some of the best scientists in the country," he said. He had more than 500 cluster patients now, and every week the number was going up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 00:23:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE00b0FrMWhDd2xNaUZfZG10SW5WeWxkMk10UWVhb0pGQnZJcmJQazJNeDBlMDY0S3hHVTJJOGg3Qm1UbW1EakFOWkZEdkd5ZjFmdmphMU5MV2ZZUdIBX0FVX3lxTE1oWXM1LWw5WExGVkczRlM0WWNoUXhxcndjNWZ4akFxVXVIcVdvdU1DMENQUXdfWV9TS2RkUlo4LTAyb0V1cEJ6VnhLanQ0VUdTWWtIaTl1Uko2QV83emVj</guid></item><item><title>“Super-K”流感变种正在澳大利亚蔓延。以下是它“不寻常”的原因- SBS澳大利亚</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-super-k-flu-variant/tdpgmr6b2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleBodyLayout_articleContentBody__bS_cb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new strain of influenza known as 'Super-K', or the subclade-K variant, could be responsible for an unusual spring and summer boost in flu cases, epidemiologists say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The unusual thing here for Australia is the timing," WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza director Patrick Reading told SBS News.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The not unusual thing is probably the symptoms," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBodyAdContainer_adContainer__fvTT2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reading recalls the subclade-K variant emerged towards the end of Australia and New Zealand's typical flu season, circulating in September rather than the winter months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"That was responsible for elevated influenza cases throughout the spring and actually throughout the start of our summer in December as well."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), the total lab confirmed cases of subclade-K in Australia so far currently sits at 1,083.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new report by the Australian Centre for Disease Control (ACDC) stated that subclade-K's rapid spread has the potential to put increased pressure on Australian health care services over the summer and into the 2026 influenza season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Current case numbers for influenza are higher than usual for this time of year compared to previous seasons," an ACDC spokesperson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So far this year, over 4,100 cases of influenza have been confirmed by laboratories, with the true number of flu cases likely to be higher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By comparison, in the first quarter of last year, an average of around 3,300 cases were confirmed weekly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;What was the cause of the subclade-K flu variant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Every few decades, a flu virus can undergo a much larger genetic change called antigenic shift, which can lead to a pandemic, but this is not what has happened with super-K," University of South Australia epidemiology professor Adrian Esterman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Instead, super-K is best understood as a drifted version of the familiar H3N2 virus, with enough changes to allow it to spread more widely in populations with existing immunity."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ACDC report noted Australian subclade-K viruses may have originated in or been imported from the US, following detections in the US in June and July last year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reading said there's no current evidence that the variant is more severe than a regular flu. What experts are seeing, however, is that it easily transmits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It appears that it's probably going to have an ability to at least be slightly less sensitive to antibody or vaccine-mediated protection," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deakin University epidemiology professor Catherine Bennett told SBS News: "This new subvariant of the H3N2 is that bit more immune evasive with these latest mutations in the part of the virus that allows it to invade our cells, making us more susceptible."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bennett said the 2025 flu vaccine included H3N2, but not this specific class.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Flu vaccines wane in effectiveness, so people vaccinated back in April-May and only getting infected now won't have the same benefit," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the 2026 flu vaccine for the southern hemisphere has already been updated to include this variant, and will likely be available around April, Bennett said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Esterman said the flu vaccine remains worthwhile and provides important protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It still significantly reduces the risk of severe disease."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;What does a typical flu season look like in Australia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When we get seasonal influenza every year in Australia, or anywhere, it's a combination of three viruses," said Reading. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are two influenza A viruses — a H3N2 and H1N1 — and one influenza B virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the Australian Centre for Disease Control, there were 365,261 reports of the flu in 2024. Cases spiked between May and August, and drastically dropped following the winter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;"As we move into spring, flu generally comes down in Australia, and then it's very low during summer," said Reading.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last year there were 502,493 reports of influenza, with cases clearly continuing until the end of the year following those winter months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to GISAID, H3N2 subclade-K is driving an estimated 90 per cent of cases in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What we saw around September [in Australia] onwards is the H1N1s and B viruses decreased, but we saw an increase in H3N2 viruses," Reading said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rich-text override-heading-font MuiBox-root mui-exul89"&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="embed-heading" id=""&gt;How can I avoid catching the flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"People who are unwell should consider testing and should avoid mixing with other people as much as possible," Bennett said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Keep homes well-ventilated, hold gatherings outdoor if possible, and wear a mask in busy public indoor spaces if susceptible to more severe respiratory infections."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;NSW Health advises getting the annual flu vaccine, as well as practising good hand hygiene — including handwashing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SBS Australia</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 00:13:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQLXl5ZzdBT2hYWkVncFVCanlhVEw4M25RRHYwYnlWNDZvRjlxS1B6TUxoc2NyZUFnOWwzM0lRZEotYjdCdjFFbHowRlFfOXVtazJ0LXVuenZLWUFJeDJUdDZPcGFFV1cyYjhIZWJCc24tVzBzUktPT0NYY0MtZWRCN0JOUGxtVUJCQ1UycW55VE9MUlNrVWozV2lsMTlkUQ</guid></item><item><title>60年代和70年代的7种常见做法今天是非法的（或可耻的） - VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/r-t-7-common-practices-from-the-60s-and-70s-that-would-be-illegal-or-scandalous-today/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;The 1960s and 70s are often remembered as decades of freedom, rebellion, and experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were loud, expressive, and full of cultural shifts that still influence how we live today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they were also surprisingly casual about things we now see as dangerous, unethical, or flat-out unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back isn’t about moral superiority, it’s about noticing how quickly norms change once we understand the consequences of our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you zoom out, it becomes a lesson in psychology more than history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we tolerate says less about right and wrong, and more about what we’ve collectively agreed not to question yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are seven everyday practices from that era that would never make it past today’s laws or social standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Smoking everywhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to overstate how normal smoking once was. Cigarettes weren’t just common, they were embedded into the physical design of public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could smoke on airplanes, in offices, in restaurants, and in hospital waiting rooms. Ashtrays were built into desks and armrests, and nobody thought twice about lighting up indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s striking is that the issue wasn’t just people choosing to smoke. It was everyone else being forced to participate whether they wanted to or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10644-secondhand-smoke-dangers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Secondhand smoke&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t widely discussed, and the idea that it could seriously harm others hadn’t yet entered the mainstream conversation. If you didn’t like it, that was your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-bt-9-things-boomers-did-in-their-30s-that-would-get-someone-fired-arrested-or-divorced-today/"&gt;smoking indoors&lt;/a&gt; in most public places is illegal, and socially it’s often frowned upon even outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift feels obvious now, but at the time it required a complete reframing of what personal choice actually means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great example of how cultural blindness works. When a behavior is everywhere, it fades into the background and stops registering as harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Corporal punishment in schools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when physical punishment in schools wasn’t controversial. It was policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers openly hit students with paddles, rulers, or straps as a form of discipline. Parents often supported it, believing it built character and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we now understand about child psychology tells a very different story. Fear may produce compliance, but it also produces &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, shame, and long-term stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most schools today ban &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/z-if-you-survived-these-9-parenting-styles-from-the-70s-youre-either-incredibly-resilient-or-deeply-traumatized/"&gt;corporal punishment&lt;/a&gt; outright, and where it still exists, it’s heavily criticized. The idea of striking a child in the name of education now feels deeply unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s uncomfortable is realizing how confident adults once were that this was the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authority plus tradition created a shield that protected the practice from scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a reminder that just because something is common doesn’t mean it’s healthy, especially when the people affected have no voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Drinking and driving as a social norm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 60s and early 70s, drunk driving wasn’t treated as a serious crime. It was often brushed off as bad judgment or even a funny story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movies played it for laughs, and police responses were inconsistent at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, officers would simply follow a driver home to make sure they got there safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that you should not drive after drinking simply hadn’t solidified yet. Alcohol and cars coexisted with little friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, this behavior is both illegal and socially condemned. DUI laws are strict, and public awareness campaigns have made the risks impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What changed wasn’t just legislation. It was perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once society collectively agreed that drunk driving wasn’t normal or funny, behavior shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/k-bt-if-youve-ever-said-no-to-these-5-types-of-invites-psychology-says-youre-mentally-stronger-than-most/"&gt;Social pressure&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be just as powerful as legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Casual prescribing of powerful drugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-78422" src="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly.png" alt="" srcset="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly.png 1600w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-300x158.png 300w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-1024x538.png 1024w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-768x403.png 768w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-1536x806.png 1536w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-1200x630.png 1200w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-857x450.png 857w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-900x473.png 900w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-420x221.png 420w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sickly-840x441.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical culture of the 60s and 70s was shockingly relaxed by today’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors regularly prescribed amphetamines, tranquilizers, and sedatives with minimal oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulants were given to boost productivity. Sedatives were handed out to help people &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/r-lc-7-behaviors-that-seem-normal-but-are-secretly-stress-responses-according-to-psychology/"&gt;cope with stress&lt;/a&gt; or boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was enormous trust in medical authority, and very little emphasis on informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients rarely questioned prescriptions, and doctors rarely explained long-term risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, that level of casual prescribing would raise serious red flags. We now require clinical trials, disclosures, and ongoing monitoring for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a decision-making perspective, this shows how power imbalances work. When one side holds all the knowledge, the other side is unlikely to push back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also shows how good intentions can still lead to harm when systems lack accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Workplace behavior with no boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office culture in the 60s and 70s operated under rules that would be unacceptable today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual &lt;a href="https://thinkhumanrights.ca/know-your-rights/what-is-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;harassment&lt;/a&gt; laws were minimal or nonexistent, and power dynamics were largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unwanted comments, inappropriate touching, and relationships between bosses and employees were often dismissed as normal office life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complaints, if they were voiced at all, were rarely taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, much of that behavior would result in immediate disciplinary action or legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift didn’t happen overnight, but it happened once language caught up to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once people had words for harassment and coercion, they could finally name what felt wrong. And once something is named, it becomes much harder to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologically, this matters because &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-t-8-signs-youre-intelligent-enough-to-see-problems-everywhere-but-not-emotionally-equipped-to-enjoy-anything/"&gt;naming a problem&lt;/a&gt; is often the first step toward dismantling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Children roaming freely without supervision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people feel nostalgic about how free childhood once was. In the 60s and 70s, kids often left the house in the morning and came back at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They played far from home, rode public transportation alone, and sometimes hitchhiked. Parents trusted that things would work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, that level of freedom would likely trigger concern or even legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents can now be accused of negligence for situations that were once routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our perception of risk has shifted dramatically. We are far more aware of worst-case scenarios, and that awareness shapes how we parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an ongoing debate about whether we’ve &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/dna-8-quiet-behaviors-that-suggest-you-dont-trust-easily-no-matter-what-you-say/"&gt;become too cautious&lt;/a&gt;. But regardless of where you land, the contrast between eras is undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows how fear and safety evolve alongside information, media, and cultural narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Advertising that openly manipulated or lied&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising in the 60s and 70s played fast and loose with the truth. Cigarettes were marketed as healthy, and sugary foods were framed as essential to a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender stereotypes were blatant, and &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/nat-8-signs-someone-is-emotionally-manipulative-but-doesnt-realize-it-according-to-psychology/"&gt;emotional manipulation&lt;/a&gt; was unapologetic. Regulations were limited, and accountability was rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, advertising laws are stricter, and consumers are more skeptical. Companies are still persuasive, but outright false claims are more likely to be challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really changed was media literacy. People slowly learned how persuasion works and how easily emotions can be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand framing and repetition, you don’t consume messages the same way. That awareness has forced brands to evolve, even if reluctantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the 60s and 70s isn’t about shaming the past. It’s about understanding how flexible our sense of normal really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What feels obvious today once required decades of debate, research, and resistance. And what feels acceptable now may one day be questioned just as intensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real takeaway is simple. Staying curious and willing to reexamine our assumptions is one of the most practical skills we can develop.&lt;/p&gt;

It can form in the eyes. Rarely, it can happen inside the body, such as in the nose or throat. Tanning beds are also responsible for the development of the malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-3" class="article-default-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it can appear anywhere – including palms, soles, or under nails – the major signs involve changes in moles or new spots with irregular shapes, borders, colors, or slowly developing bleeding or itching – so early detection is crucial as it’s more likely to spread than other skin cancers. &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-879904"&gt;Treatment&lt;/a&gt; usually involves surgery, potentially followed by immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or radiation if it has spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-6" class="article-paragraph-wrap"&gt;&lt;p class="article-paragraph-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;Although Israel has a relatively high incidence of melanoma compared to many countries – partly due to frequent sun exposure (intentional when getting a sunburn) or unintentional, and the prevalence of unprotected fair skin among many residents – the mortality rates are relatively low thanks to early detection and good treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-8" class="article-paragraph-wrap"&gt;&lt;p class="article-paragraph-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;According to the Health Ministry, there are between 1,700 and 2,000 new diagnoses of this type of skin cancer in Israel every year.

They discovered a mechanism that allows melanoma cancer cells to paralyze immune cells by secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are tiny, bubble-shaped containers secreted from a given cell. The research team believes that this discovery has far-reaching implications for possible treatments for melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-14" class="article-default-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dramatic breakthrough was led by Prof. Carmit Levy of the human genetics and computational medicine department at TAU’s Gray Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences – in collaboration with research teams from the Weizmann Institute of Science, the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Hadassah-University Medical Center, Rabin Medical Center, Wolfson Medical Center, &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-882606"&gt;Sheba Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Liège (Belgium), Massachusetts General Hospital, Paris-Saclay University, and the University of Zurich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-15" class="article-default-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings have just been published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; under the title “HLA export by melanoma cells decoys cytotoxic T cells to promote immune evasion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-17" class="article-default-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levy, who received a master’s degree in pharmacy and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the Hebrew University, plus post-doctoral studies at Harvard University, has worked on this project for almost six years. She said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Jerusalem Post&lt;/em&gt; that it was known that there are immune cells in metastases biopsies of melanoma, but it was not known if and how they could kill the immune cells that attack. “When we made our discovery, it was very surprising to us and everybody in the field,” she said. She and her lab team start working on other cancers as well. “It will take time to reach the bedside, but we are eager to take a step forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-18" class="article-paragraph-wrap"&gt;&lt;p class="article-paragraph-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;In the first stage of the disease, melanocytic cells divide uncontrollably in the epidermis, which is the skin’s outer layer. In the second stage, the cancer cells invade the inner dermis layer and metastasize through the lymphatic and blood systems. In previous studies, Levy discovered that as they grow in the epidermis, melanoma cells secrete large EVs called melanosomes, which penetrate blood vessels and dermal cells, forming a favorable niche for the cancer cells to spread. The new study found that these vesicles also enable cancer cells to paralyze the immune cells that attack them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-19" class="article-default-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We began studying these vesicles,” Levy told the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, “and I noticed that on the vesicles membrane there was a ligand – a binding molecule that is supposed to bind to a receptor found only on immune cells called lymphocytes that can kill cancer cells when coming into direct contact with them. I thought that this ligand latches onto lymphocytes that come to kill the melanoma. This was an innovative and odd idea and we started investigating it in the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-20" class="article-paragraph-wrap"&gt;&lt;p class="article-paragraph-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;When the TAU team collected more evidence that this idea was correct, she contacted colleagues around the world. All came together in a joint effort to decipher the cancer’s behavior – and the achievement is enormous. “We discovered that the cancer essentially fires these vesicles at the immune cells that attack it, disrupting their activity and even killing them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-21" class="article-paragraph-wrap"&gt;&lt;p class="article-paragraph-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;Levy’s research focuses on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the development, progression, and microenvironment interactions of melanoma and other cancers, including the role of microRNAs, particularly in melanocyte differentiation and malignant transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-22" class="article-paragraph-wrap"&gt;&lt;p class="article-paragraph-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;She received her doctorate from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, completed post-doctoral studies at Harvard University, and in 2019 was awarded with the Young Investigator Award by the Society of Melanoma Research Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-23" class="article-paragraph-wrap"&gt;&lt;p class="article-paragraph-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;Levy stressed that the extraordinary discovery is promising, but that more work is needed to translate it into a new therapy. “We still have a great deal of work ahead of us, but it is already clear that this discovery can have far-reaching therapeutic implications,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-24" class="article-paragraph-wrap"&gt;&lt;p class="article-paragraph-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;“It will enable us to strengthen immune cells so they can withstand the melanoma’s counterattack. In parallel, as we successfully did in a mice model, we can block the molecules that enables vesicles to cling to immune cells, thereby exposing the cancer cells and making them more vulnerable. Either way, this study opens a new door to effective immunotherapeutic intervention. “Our study highlights a novel immune evasion mechanism,” she concluded, “and proposes a therapeutic avenue to enhance tumor immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Jerusalem Post</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 21:41:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5ySk1YQVRIVnllVHdxZk4tLUdYYmo0QTJsNkoxS0JWWFUtZVJsbmlGdlFDT0R1STlfRDNMaHc4cHRDb3Vody1BWXJVaThrRXJPQkV0MmRWM0UyRDdFZlduQk4xMDBlbmc</guid></item><item><title>根据心理学，在这8项日常任务中挣扎的人通常比95%的人更聪明- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/r-t-people-who-struggle-with-these-8-everyday-tasks-are-often-more-intelligent-than-95-of-people-according-to-psychology/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;There’s a quiet shame that comes with struggling at things everyone else seems to do without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You miss deadlines, forget small details, or feel oddly out of place in situations that look simple on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve felt that shame before, especially in my twenties when I was working in luxury food and beverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment demanded polish, speed, and social ease, and yet some of the sharpest minds I met were the ones quietly wrestling with basic, everyday stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology backs this up in a way that feels almost comforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence doesn’t always show up as efficiency, smoothness, or consistency, and in many cases it shows up as friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wondered why your brain seems to trip over things others breeze through, this list might explain more than you expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Making small talk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-if-small-talk-makes-you-want-to-scream-you-probably-have-these-7-rare-personality-traits/"&gt;Small talk&lt;/a&gt; is one of those social skills that’s treated like a basic requirement for adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you struggle with it, people assume you’re awkward, unfriendly, or lacking confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for highly intelligent people, the issue usually isn’t social fear. It’s boredom mixed with a hunger for substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that people with higher &lt;a href="https://www.happyneuronpro.com/en/info/what-are-cognitive-abilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive ability&lt;/a&gt; tend to seek meaning, patterns, and depth in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an interaction offers none of that, their brains disengage almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve sat through countless dinners where the conversation revolved around weather, surface-level work complaints, or recycled anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind would drift not because I disliked the people, but because my brain was itching for something more nourishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some minds, small talk feels like empty calories. It fills time but leaves no mental satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Sticking to rigid routines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a popular idea that discipline looks like doing the same thing at the same time every day. Wake up early, follow a strict schedule, repeat forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly intelligent people often struggle with this kind of rigidity. Their minds crave novelty, variation, and flexibility more than repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological studies have linked higher intelligence with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2937090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;openness&lt;/a&gt; to experience and sensitivity to stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That combination makes rigid routines feel mentally suffocating over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried hyper-optimized &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/d-bt-8-morning-routines-that-give-you-an-unfair-advantage-in-life/"&gt;morning routines&lt;/a&gt; more times than I care to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They work for a short burst, then my brain starts rebelling and asking why everything has to happen in the same order every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean you lack discipline. It often means your mind is wired to adapt rather than repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Finishing simple tasks quickly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the task should take five minutes. Somehow, it takes thirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly intelligent people &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/k-t-you-can-tell-someone-was-raised-by-emotionally-distant-parents-if-they-do-these-8-things-in-relationships/"&gt;tend to overanalyze&lt;/a&gt; even the smallest decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their brains naturally explore multiple possibilities, outcomes, and implications before settling on action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists sometimes call this &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/mental-health/how-can-i-stop-overthinking-everything?srsltid=AfmBOoq8lTC3kABWsWxXDcSxluyiK_NG9O-viqLMtDd_RBaP3Qs0jmoR" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;overthinking&lt;/a&gt;, but that label misses the point. It’s not anxiety driving the process, it’s depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve caught myself spending way too long choosing what to order at a restaurant, thinking through flavor combinations, portion sizes, and regret minimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the server is just trying to move the table along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your brain is built for complexity, simplicity doesn’t come naturally. Even basic tasks get upgraded into mini thought experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Letting go of mistakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90934" src="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Thinking-.png" alt="" srcset="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Thinking-.png 1600w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Thinking--300x158.png 300w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Thinking--1024x538.png 1024w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Thinking--768x403.png 768w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Thinking--1536x806.png 1536w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Thinking--1200x630.png 1200w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Thinking--857x450.png 857w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Thinking--900x473.png 900w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Thinking--420x221.png 420w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Thinking--840x441.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people mess up and move on instantly. Others replay the moment in their head for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly intelligent people are far more likely to struggle with this. Their brains &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/z-lc-8-signs-youre-not-a-perfectionist-youre-just-terrified-of-being-seen-failing/"&gt;treat mistakes as data&lt;/a&gt; that needs to be analyzed and integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a psychological standpoint, this makes sense. Intelligence is closely tied to learning, and learning depends on noticing errors and adjusting behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high-pressure kitchens, mistakes are expensive and visible. You either reflect on them deeply or repeat them and fall behind fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that the same mental habit that helps you grow can also trap you in self-criticism if you don’t consciously let the lesson end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Falling asleep easily&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your mind lights up the moment your head hits the pillow, you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly intelligent people often struggle to fall asleep because their brains don’t naturally slow down on command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1476840/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have linked higher cognitive engagement with increased nighttime mental activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When external stimulation disappears, internal processing ramps up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had nights where a single idea snowballed into a full mental outline for an article, a career plan, or a half-baked business concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great for creativity, terrible for rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a failure of discipline or routine. It’s a brain that’s &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-if-you-think-in-these-8-complex-ways-your-mind-operates-differently-than-95-of-people/"&gt;wired to think deeply&lt;/a&gt; whenever it has space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Remembering mundane details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly intelligent people often have &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-t-10-childhood-details-only-people-with-exceptional-memory-still-remember/"&gt;excellent memory&lt;/a&gt; for concepts, patterns, and ideas. Strangely, they tend to struggle with basic, everyday details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology suggests this comes down to &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-selective-attention-2795022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;selective attention&lt;/a&gt;. The brain prioritizes information it deems meaningful and filters out the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask me about a book I read years ago and I can recall its core argument with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask me where I put my keys an hour ago and I’ll need to retrace my steps like a detective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean your memory is bad. It means it’s optimized for meaning, not logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Staying present in boring environments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long meetings, repetitive lectures, or conversations that go nowhere can feel physically uncomfortable for highly intelligent people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their minds disengage quickly when stimulation drops below a certain threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research links intelligence with a tendency toward &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374102703_Intentional_mind_wandering_is_objectively_linked_to_low_effort_and_tasks_with_high_predictability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mental wandering&lt;/a&gt; in low-engagement environments. The brain seeks complexity when none is provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentally planned meals, workouts, articles, and entire trips while sitting in painfully dull settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the outside, it might look like disinterest, but internally the brain is just staying busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trait can be a liability in structured environments. It can also be a powerful source of creativity if you learn how to channel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8) Finally, turning off self-criticism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one of the most overlooked struggles of highly intelligent people is their relationship with themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence brings awareness, and awareness often brings harsh self-evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice gaps others miss. You see inefficiencies, flaws, and missed opportunities with uncomfortable clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology has long noted the connection between intelligence and heightened &lt;a href="https://paradigmpersonality.com/resources/self-monitoring-psychology-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;self-monitoring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same mind that analyzes the world with precision turns inward with equal force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve met incredibly capable people who &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/n-t-8-behaviors-of-people-who-have-lost-their-self-worth-without-realizing-it/"&gt;downplay their achievements&lt;/a&gt; while obsessing over minor missteps. Externally impressive, internally relentless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to soften that internal voice isn’t about lowering standards. It’s about recognizing when analysis has stopped being useful and started becoming noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggling with everyday tasks doesn’t automatically mean you’re failing at life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, it means your brain is optimized for depth, complexity, and meaning in a world that rewards speed and surface-level competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand this, the shame starts to dissolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You stop trying to force yourself into systems that don’t fit and start building ones that actually support how your mind works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence isn’t always visible. Sometimes it shows up quietly, in the friction between a deep mind and a shallow world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you recognized yourself in this list, you’re not broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re just wired differently, and that difference can become a strength once you learn how to work with it instead of against it.&lt;/p&gt;

																										&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/category/archaeology/"&gt;Archaeologists&lt;/a&gt; have made an unexpected discovery within a 2,000-year-old grave in Ukraine that may reshape our existing knowledge of ancient &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/burial-pits-in-france-reveal-grisly-evidence-of-brutality-during-warfare-and-captivity-in-neolithic-europe/"&gt;burial traditions&lt;/a&gt; in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a red pigment within a grave located at Chervony Mayak, an ancient &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/scientists-analyzing-ancient-scythian-artifacts-have-made-a-gruesome-discovery/"&gt;Scythian&lt;/a&gt; cemetery in the southern part of the country, has revealed the presence of cinnabar, according to researchers who say the &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/60000-year-old-projectiles-are-the-worlds-first-poison-arrows-extending-earliest-use-in-africa-by-thousands-of-years/"&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt; mineral has never been previously identified within burial sites associated with the Late Scythian period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pigment was found to be a thin layer covering sediment composed of quartz, microcline, albite, and calcite,” report the authors of a recent study that appeared in &lt;em&gt;Antiquity &lt;/em&gt;describing the discovery, who note that the sample was comprised of small, sharp-edged particles amid “chemical compounds present in the grave fill” at the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery is significant because it illustrates what appears to be a previously undocumented aspect of burial customs from the period. Presently, researchers believe the use of cinnabar at the location was intentional, possibly with &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/ancient-ritual-sacrifice-archaeologists-are-unraveling-the-enigma-of-an-ancient-ecuadorian-burial/"&gt;ritual&lt;/a&gt; significance that has yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Study in Scarlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinnabar, sometimes also known as “cinnabarite” or “mercurblende,” bears a striking bright red coloration. A form of mercury sulfide, it is also the most abundant ore used in the refinement of elemental mercury. Past discoveries already recognize the mineral as having been used prevalently in the &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/mysterious-figurines-from-sardinias-bronze-age-reveal-an-unexpected-discovery-about-the-ancient-world/"&gt;ancient world&lt;/a&gt; for its bright scarlet coloration, which was incorporated into a variety of pigments used in the ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its striking appearance that attracted its use in colorful pigments, people in the ancient world also knew about the toxic properties of cinnabar, with some theories even suggesting that &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/love-of-wine-leads-to-chance-discovery-of-widespread-mercury-poisoning-in-copper-age-180979091/"&gt;it may have been intentionally ingested&lt;/a&gt; under some circumstances as part of ritual ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archaeological team behind the recent discovery in Ukraine says the toxic mineral was found in grave 155, a location at Chervony Mayak where the remains of two women had been found. Evidence indicates their burials occurred at different times, and near the skull of the older of the two women, three small deposits of red material were found, alongside other items that included beaded jewelry and items made from copper alloy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyzing a Toxic Discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the appearance of red substances in graves from the period is not particularly unusual, past testing of their composition—if it occurs at all—had never previously identified the toxic mineral in question, according to study lead author Olena Dzneladze of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance, the presence of cinnabar was confirmed following testing that included examination of the substance using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is not currently possible to determine precisely the function(s) of cinnabar and the other red pigments found in Late Scythian graves, but their deposition in graves appears intentional,” Dzneladze and colleagues write in their paper. “Different pigments may have had distinct functions, although more broadly they likely had a ritual, germicidal, as well as cosmetic and pharmaceutical role,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracing Ancient Scythian Cinnabar &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the location from which the cinnabar may have originated has not yet been determined, the team says that it is known to be found in southern Ukraine, and that its origin may be determinable through future studies, which may help to provide context for its appearance in the burial at Chervony Mayak, as well as how it might have been used in trade during this period in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results highlight the vital role of archaeometric analyses in examining and correcting the interpretation of mineral substances discovered at some archaeological sites,” Dzneladze and the team conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The application of such analyses is still rare, and further discussion of the function and provenance of pigments can proceed only with additional analyses and when the reference database is extended,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team’s &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/mysterious-red-cinnabar-from-the-chervony-mayak-burial-ground-ukraine/99A5ECFAA469E559488E1736BC694AEB"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, “Mysterious red: cinnabar from the Chervony Mayak burial ground, Ukraine,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Antiquity &lt;/em&gt;last year.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s that time of year again, but this time it’s particularly bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Respiratory illnesses, especially influenza, are tearing through Northern Virginia, accounting for 22% of ER visits in the week ending Jan. 3, &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/respiratory-diseases-in-virginia/data/"&gt;according to the Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A particularly nasty strand of influenza A, subclade k, is driving this flu season, which peaks from December to February. The mutated strand emerged after the 2025 flu vaccine was developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; there have been at least 11 million cases of flu this season nationwide. The CDC also estimates 120,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths. The spread is rated at high or very high in 48 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dr. Meredith Porter, medical director for Inova-GoHealth Urgent Care in Northern Virginia, said there are “very high acute respiratory illness levels” across the region. The urgent care system is a joint venture between Inova and GoHealth and operates 23 centers across the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-nvm_instory_ad" data-unit="/22545743209/insidenova/news/fairfax/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"nvm_instory"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The urgent care system is increasing support staff and extending virtual visit hours to midnight to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We’re trying our best to avoid people going to the emergency room,” Porter told InsideNoVa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There might be a light at the end of the tunnel, Porter said. Statewide, the number of respiratory-related cases at ERs dropped from the week ending Dec. 27 to the week ending Jan. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This flu season started picking up after school was out and people started traveling for the holidays, Porter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-nvm_instory_ad" data-unit="/22545743209/insidenova/news/fairfax/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"nvm_instory"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“When you are around a lot of people, you may not yet know that you’re starting to get sick,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Porter said the typical flu symptoms start, and “you almost feel like you’ve been hit by a bus.” That includes body aches, fever, cough and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Unless you’re having difficulty breathing, chest pain, dehydration or changes to your lucidity, Porter recommended going to a primary care or urgent care first. Those providers can provide early testing and antiviral treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you’ve got the flu, rest as much as possible and stay hydrated. If you’ve got to go out into the world, Porter recommended wearing a mask and staying as far from others as possible. The first three days after the onset of symptoms are when people are the most contagious, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-nvm_instory_ad" data-unit="/22545743209/insidenova/news/fairfax/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"nvm_instory"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For everyone else, Porter recommended using hand sanitizer, washing your hands frequently, wipe down things like grocery store carts and keep your distance from people who look symptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“If you’re standing in that check out line,” she said, “give yourself a bit of space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When it comes to your health, your thoughts may already be preoccupied with figuring out &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/heres-how-to-get-enough-protein-a-day-1"&gt;more ways to get protein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-sleep-better-according-to-sleep-experts-1"&gt;how to get more sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/cardio-before-or-after-weight-lifting-1"&gt;whether you should do cardio before or after lifting weights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2811350"&gt;a 2023 study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, more than 40% of U.S. adults with high LDL cholesterol didn’t know they had it. This means that there are a whole lot of people out there who are at &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470561"&gt;an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of having a heart attack, stroke, or getting heart disease, and they don’t even know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that your cholesterol levels are something you can control. We asked cardiologists about how to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is LDL cholesterol?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/cholesterol-explained"&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; is typically referenced generally and almost always negatively, but it’s actually a bit more nuanced. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/utilities/our-experts/ethan-korngold.html" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/utilities/our-experts/ethan-korngold.html"}' href="https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/utilities/our-experts/ethan-korngold.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ethan Korngold, MD,&lt;/a&gt; an interventional cardiologist who works with the health company Abbott, explains that cholesterol, which is a waxy fat-like substance found in the body, is essential to build cells and produce vitamins and hormones. “However, too much cholesterol can cause problems because it narrows the arteries, blocking blood flow, which increases the risk of heart disease,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470561/"&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; is transported through the blood by lipoproteins, including two types of lipoproteins: high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). HDL (often referred to as “good” cholesterol) transports cholesterol to the liver, where it’s then broken down and excreted. LDL transports cholesterol to cells, and as Dr. Korngold explained, too much of it can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries. That’s why LDL cholesterol is often referred to as “bad” cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do you know if you have high LDL cholesterol?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re relatively young and generally in good health, preventing high LDL cholesterol is still important. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason"}' href="https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jason Hoff, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a structural interventional cardiologist and assistant professor at Loma Linda University Health, says that cholesterol plaque buildup is something that can happen over time without you even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not something you can feel. It can eventually lead to a heart attack or stroke, and the process often starts decades before symptoms appear, even as early as your 20s and 30s,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://walkwithadoc.org/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://walkwithadoc.org/"}' href="https://walkwithadoc.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walk with a Doc&lt;/a&gt; CEO and cardiologist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1962401083/david-a-sabgir-md" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1962401083/david-a-sabgir-md"}' href="https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1962401083/david-a-sabgir-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="1962401083" data-aps-asc-tag="gqdailynl-20"&gt;Dr. David Sabgir, MD&lt;/a&gt;, says being proactive about your heart health is key to staying healthy. “Even if you feel great, cholesterol can climb quietly, especially if you have a family history of heart disease,” says Dr. Sabgir. “High LDL cholesterol builds up over time and raises the risk for heart attack and stroke. The fix is simple. If we know our numbers and stay ahead of them, we can make a huge difference in our health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since you can’t feel LDL cholesterol slowly creeping up, how do you know if yours is too high? All three cardiologists say that it requires a blood test from your doctor and it’s something Dr. Korngold recommends everyone 20 and older have regularly checked. &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/about-cholesterol/what-your-cholesterol-levels-mean"&gt;The American Heart Association says&lt;/a&gt; that optimal LDL cholesterol is at or below 100 mg/dL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sabgir explains that genetics play a big role in causing high LDL cholesterol. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2903789/"&gt;Research published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Lipid Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; estimates that 40 to 60% of high cholesterol is due to genetics. That means you could be working out regularly and hitting your nutrient goals and still have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something else that contributes to high LDL cholesterol that’s out of your control is aging. “As you age, your body becomes less efficient at clearing bad cholesterol from the bloodstream, which increases your risk,” Dr. Korngold says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 17:20:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFByMFQ2dEV5dDItNWNPd191Uy16RE9raW1LYmJxcTRNUnh6WXBNVmFGZWJaemljd3JBb1pDT0ZZZ3V1Ym5Ia0Q1em1BZmFISGRjamJRR1FwMWFTNUc2eFZMU0gyNmRQNUxvRW5zTld3b1FyYWVsNVFDS2dDS01GVGs</guid></item><item><title>人类卵子提前“恢复活力” ，可以提高试管婴儿成功率--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2026/jan/09/human-eggs-rejuvenated-in-advance-that-could-boost-ivf-success-rates</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists claim to have “rejuvenated” human eggs for the first time in an advance that they predict could revolutionise &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ivf" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;IVF&lt;/a&gt; success rates for older women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The groundbreaking research suggests that an age-related defect that causes genetic errors in embryos could be reversed by supplementing eggs with a crucial protein. When eggs donated by fertility patients were given microinjections of the protein, they were almost half as likely to show the defect compared with untreated eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If confirmed in more extensive trials, the approach has the potential to improve egg quality, which is the primary cause of IVF failure and miscarriage in older women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Overall we can nearly halve the number of eggs with [abnormal] chromosomes. That’s a very prominent improvement,” said Prof Melina Schuh, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Göttingen and a co-founder of Ovo Labs, which is aiming to commercialise the technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Most women in their early 40s do have eggs, but nearly all of the eggs have incorrect chromosome numbers,” added Schuh, whose lab has been investigating egg biology for the past two decades. “This was the motivation for wanting to address this problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings will be presented at the &lt;a href="https://www.fertilityconference.org/event/1ee53df6-56c5-4634-a9d6-30bbe6c9deec/home" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;British Fertility Conference in Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; on Friday and have been published as a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.08.698387v1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;preprint paper on the Biorxiv website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The decline in egg quality is the main reason IVF success rates drop steeply with female age and is why the risk of chromosome disorders such as Down’s syndrome increases with maternal age. For patients under 35, the average birthrate for each embryo transferred in IVF treatment was 35%, compared with just 5% for women aged 43-44, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.hfea.gov.uk/about-us/publications/research-and-data/fertility-treatment-2023-trends-and-figures/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;most recent UK figures&lt;/a&gt;. The average age of fertility patients starting treatment for the first time in the UK is now over 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Agata Zielinska, a co-founder and co-CEO of Ovo Labs, said: “Currently, when it comes to female factor infertility, the only solution that’s available to most patients is trying IVF multiple times so that, cumulatively, your likelihood of success increases. What we envision is that many more women would be able to conceive within a single IVF cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The latest approach targets a vulnerability in eggs linked to a process called meiosis, in which sex cells (eggs or sperm) jettison half their genetic material so they can join together to make an embryo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In eggs, this requires 23 pairs of X-shaped chromosomes to align along a single axis in the cell. On fertilisation, the cell divides causing the chromosome pairs to be – ideally – neatly snapped down their centres to create a cell with precisely 23 single chromosomes from the mother, the rest being delivered by the sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, in older eggs the chromosome pairs tend to loosen at their midpoint, becoming slightly unstuck or detaching entirely before fertilisation. In this scenario, the X-shaped structures fail to line up properly and move around chaotically in the cell, so when the cell divides they are not snapped symmetrically. This results in an embryo with too many or too few chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Schuh and colleagues previously found that a protein, Shugoshin 1, which appears to act as a glue for the chromosome pairs, declines with age. In the latest experiments in mouse and human eggs, they found that microinjections of Shugoshin 1 appeared to reverse the problem of chromosome pairs separating prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Using eggs donated by patients at the Bourn Hall fertility clinic in Cambridge, they found that the number showing the defect decreased from 53% in control eggs to 29% in treated eggs. When they looked only at eggs from women over 35 years of age, a similar trend was seen (65% compared with 44%), although this result was not statistically significant, which the scientists said was probably due to them only having treated nine eggs in this age range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What is really beautiful is that we identified a single protein that, with age, goes down, returned it to young levels and it has a big effect,” Schuh said. “We are just restoring the younger situation again with this approach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The approach would not extend fertility beyond menopause, when the egg reserve runs out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aside from intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), there are not currently any treatments involving microinjections into eggs, but the team does not anticipate safety issues and are in discussions with regulators about a clinical trial. An important question will be whether the apparent improvements in egg quality results in embryos with fewer genetic errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Güneş Taylor, of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the research, described the findings as “really promising”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is really important work because we need approaches that work for older eggs because that’s the point at which most women appear,” she said. “If there’s a one-shot injection that substantially increases the number of eggs with properly organised chromosomes, that gives you a better starting point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQdTA2SEdWU3NfV2NDc21mS1lqUW5OaER4QzY3dUJnRHFjdjVxQXdsbXFpbnZEbHotQ2FpWjAtNlZ0dkxxMjJfQnFFc2dvZWZJYlMzNW9yRTdIR1k3bTBpNUJFZEp4aDAzWDMzZ1BxdUFlM1F4YWVwc2EwWENrTWhZd1ZtV2ZyMWFJUWsxcG1fUnl6NkZmU2hnYW1EeUdIOTh1MklUTklnNUctcl9fQTQ2YXcxTElLYUk</guid></item><item><title>尊敬的Annie ：肿瘤学家告诉我，我是“幸存者” ，但我不觉得自己是“幸存者” - NJ.com</title><link>https://www.nj.com/advice/2026/01/dear-annie-oncologists-tell-me-im-a-survivor-but-i-dont-feel-like-a-survivor.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KWC4BU7SJNCJLKPO75DZQV7ZMY"&gt;DEAR ANNIE: I was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months ago. I’ve been through surgery and radiation treatments. According to the oncologists, I should now consider myself a “survivor.” Since I have scars, I’m taking medication for the next 10 years that has potentially really bad side effects, and the chance of reoccurrence is a definite possibility, I don’t feel like a “survivor.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HOESMRSVMFG5ZC2LOUMOI2RTHA"&gt;I readily admit that I’m depressed. I maintain that this is a perfectly reasonable reaction to something bad that has upended and changed my whole life for the foreseeable future. I’m not suicidal, and although some mornings are hard, I get up every day, shower, brush my hair and teeth and maintain my usual schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FF26BAMBO5DINFIHNXYLVOVGP4"&gt;The worst thing to me about cancer is that I can’t talk to anyone because I’ve gone from an actual person with thoughts and interests to people only wanting to know about the cancer. It’s all anyone asks about. That being the case, I tried to talk to people about how I feel, but the word “depressed” freaks people out more than “cancer.” Now I just say I’m fine or OK to make others feel comfortable, which applies to my doctors as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XIYAEA7KDVENPHBBP7UWUY5SJ4"&gt;I don’t need medication, and I tried online and in-person group discussions a few times, and they aren’t for me. I’ve noticed the same thing with people who lose a loved one or have something else bad happen -- they aren’t allowed to be depressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7YJRC56AINEV7OAKKAREX3R7ZI"&gt;When did it become shameful and something that needs to be fixed when people have a true human emotion to events?

What is troubling is feeling you have to hide it -- especially from your doctors, who need the full picture, whether it’s pretty or not. You’re allowed to say, “I’m getting through it, but it’s still hard,” and you deserve people in your corner who can hear that without panicking or minimizing it, no matter how uncomfortable it may make them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UZORQBPD3NGXNKHFJDA4DSTYZM"&gt;Healing doesn’t happen overnight. Give yourself permission to feel whatever comes and ask honestly for the support you need. A survivor isn’t someone who feels strong all the time; it’s someone who keeps going despite hardship.

				&lt;p&gt;A Massachusetts mother is sharing her family’s frightening experience with the flu after her 4-year-old daughter developed a rare but potentially deadly complication of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlin Lyons of Ashland &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/massachusetts-flu-brain-swelling/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; CBS News that her daughter, Althea, came to her in the middle of the night, complaining of dizziness. She was taken to Mass General Hospital, where doctors became concerned after diagnosing her with acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though rare, ANE is linked to common viral infections such as the flu and causes rapid brain swelling that can lead to lasting brain damage or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-treatments/acute-necrotizing-encephalopathy-ane"&gt;Boston Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms of ANE can develop quickly and often begin with signs similar to the flu, including fever, congestion, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. As the condition progresses, symptoms may become severe and life-threatening, with some patients losing consciousness, experiencing seizures, or developing serious breathing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://answers.childrenshospital.org/ane-flu/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Boston Children’s Neuroimmunology Center found that ANE has a mortality rate of about 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just remember [the doctor] saying, ‘She’s very sick, I’m very concerned,’” Lyons told CBS. “And my only question was, ‘Is she going to live?’ And he said, ‘I hope so.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons said her daughter’s age may have helped her survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thank God she’s the age that she is — old enough to fight the flu, which she had to get over before the swelling could come down, but young enough to have the time to heal, for her brain to heal, because there was damage done,” she told the news station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Althea is now recovering, Lyons said, but she chose to share her family’s story to raise awareness about the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I understand they are seeing more cases of this disease, but I think overall it’s still pretty unknown,” Lyons told CBS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her story comes as flu cases continue to surge across Massachusetts this winter. State health officials have reported 66 flu-related deaths so far this season, &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2026/01/06/4th-massachusetts-child-dies-of-flu/"&gt;including four children&lt;/a&gt; — two of whom were under the age of 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Boston, confirmed flu cases increased by 126 percent between Dec. 14 and Dec. 27, &lt;a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/two-flu-related-deaths-among-children-under-two-years-old-boston"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to city health officials, with hospitalizations nearly tripling. Flu-related emergency room visits also rose by 135 percent during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flu cases are surging in Boston, and we are seeing an uptick in serious cases involving children, including the tragic deaths of two very young children,” said Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, commissioner of public health for the City of Boston. “While the flu is usually mild, it can cause hospitalization and death. Children under the age of 2 are at higher risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ojikutu urged parents to vaccinate children ages six months and older and to seek immediate medical care if a child with flu symptoms shows signs of severe illness, including trouble breathing, decreased urination, persistently high fever, or extreme lethargy.&lt;/p&gt;
