						&lt;p&gt;What began as a routine breast reduction surgery led to a potentially life-saving discovery. When 45-year-old Kim Burris was recovering at home in Chapel Hill, she received a call that changed her life.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; For most of her adult life, Burris thought about getting a breast reduction. She struggled with back pain, clothing that didn’t fit well and constant discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Three years after having her daughter and going through the journey of breastfeeding, she decided it was time.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; “I felt like an imposter in my own body, in many ways,” she said. “I felt like I wanted to do something for myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; During the surgery, Raleigh plastic surgeon Dr. Heather Levites noticed something abnormal. She removed the tissue and sent it out for testing. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Any piece of breast tissue that comes out of your body should be sent to a pathologist,” Levites said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The results came back as ductal carcinoma in situ, also known as DCIS, the most common form of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/raleigh-surgeon-spots-early-stage-breast-cancer-october-2025"&gt;
								&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/raleigh-surgeon-spots-early-stage-breast-cancer-october-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;DCIS starts in the breast ducts and can spread to surrounding tissue. Early signs include painless lumps in the breast or armpit, redness, changes to the nipple, one breast being larger than the other and a red rash. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I think for a moment I had one of those out of body experiences,” Burris said when she first received the news. “I was numb, very numb, and shocked because I wasn’t anticipating that. But she did a really great job at putting me at ease and giving me all the facts. I’m a very fact-driven person.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; Burris’ grandmother had breast cancer. She had been getting routine mammograms, which are the best tool for early breast cancer detection. However, the screenings did not pick up the DCIS. The only symptom Burris had was a clogged milk duct, which she associated with breastfeeding. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Levities connected Burris to Dr. Jennifer Plichta, a surgical oncologist at Duke Cancer Center. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Early detection of breast cancer increases survival rates, reduces the risk of cancer spreading to other areas of the body and allows for less invasive treatment options. In addition, it empowers women to take control of their health and provides a sense of control, and reduces anxiety, according to the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/raleigh-surgeon-spots-early-stage-breast-cancer-october-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Levites said being proactive is the first step in preventive treatment, and self-exams are usually the first indication something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We are our own best advocates. We know our bodies best,” Levites said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Due to the early detection of DCIS, Burris does not require additional treatment. She said she will continue to take preventative measures and schedule routine check-ups. &lt;/p&gt;

Brown eggs vs. white eggs—which is healthier? Some choose the brand or type of eggs they want regardless of the color, while others stick to the same hue every time they buy a new dozen. But does the difference on the outside extend to its contents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://nutrition-wise.com/about-vicki-koenig/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vicki Koenig, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vicki Koenig, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a masters level registered dietitian at Nutrition-Wise; Emer Delaney, R.D., P.T., a registered dietitian and founder of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="http://www.myprivatediet.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:My Private Dietitian;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;My Private Dietitian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, dietitians explain the difference between brown eggs vs. white eggs, plus which you should be buying to get the most nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brown eggs vs. white eggs: What’s the difference?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The color of eggs has to do with the breed of the chicken,” says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://nutrition-wise.com/about-vicki-koenig/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vicki Koenig, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vicki Koenig, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a masters level registered dietitian at Nutrition-Wise. “Whiter colored chickens lay white eggs.” Brown eggs, on the other hand, are laid by hens that have red or brown feathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the color difference, you may have noticed that brown eggs tend to be more expensive than white. “The breeds that lay brown eggs are usually larger and consume more food and energy, which means they're more expensive for the farmer to produce,” says Emer Delaney, R.D., P.T., a registered dietitian and founder of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="http://www.myprivatediet.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:My Private Dietitian;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;My Private Dietitian&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/uploads/234/69325/Chicken_Breed_Chart_to_Help_Choose_Your_Chicken.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hens that lay brown eggs;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hens that lay brown eggs&lt;/a&gt; are larger, most over seven pounds, while the chicken breeds that lay white eggs are smaller, typically weighing less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brown eggs vs. white eggs: Which is healthier?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nutritionally, brown and white eggs are identical. There is no difference,” says Koenig. That means that regardless of the color eggs you choose, you’ll get nutrients like 6 g of complete &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a68067521/signs-not-getting-enough-protein/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; per egg, plus vitamins A, D, E, K, and others, choline, antioxidants, and healthy fats. These deliver benefits like energy and satiety, support for mood regulation and muscle control, and reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.incredibleegg.org/nutrition/articles/what-are-the-nutritional-differences-for-different-types-of-eggs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Egg Board;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Egg Board&lt;/a&gt;, brown and white eggs will still contain the same nutrient profiles, whether they are cage-free, free-range, conventional, or organic. They explain that these labels refer exclusively to the way the eggs are farmed and that the only way to change the nutrient content of the eggs themselves is to feed the hens a fortified diet (the increased levels of fortified nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids or &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a66133153/best-time-take-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, would be noted in the nutrition facts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9102658/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Molecules;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;compared the nutritional components of organic and conventional eggs, finding that organic eggs actually had higher levels of nutrients needed for infant and child growth and development, and conventional eggs had more that were beneficial for fat metabolism and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65628846/foods-to-lower-cholesterol-naturally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reducing cholesterol;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reducing cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, despite both containing cholesterol. Though ultimately, both had plenty of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The color of the eggshell reflects the color of the hen that laid the egg. “It’s as fun and as simple as that,” says Delaney.

            Humans are living 20 years longer than they were in 1950, according to new research with all 204 countries and territories studied reporting declines in their mortality rates since then. But vast inequities remain, and there is an “emerging crisis” of rising death rates among adolescents and young adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n00043b6nygi8gdbo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2023, life expectancy was 76.3 years for women and 71.5 years for men, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01330-3/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;analyses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;published Sunday in the journal The Lancet by the University of Washington School of Medicine’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) – returning to pre-pandemic levels after falling during the height of Covid.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n00053b6ng2q2cp7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Covid-19 fell from the leading cause of death in 2021 to 20th place in 2023, with heart disease and stroke rising to again become the leading causes of death globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Deaths worldwide have generally been shifting away from infectious disease, with sharp declines in deaths from measles, diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flancet%2Farticle%2FPIIS0140-6736(25)01917-8%2Ffulltext&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ce46539032fd94f627b5908de081ff30c%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638957130480695273%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=O3XV4oJjSMU2XHU4VyGS7XofJf6XMtXSiGOqaDVWMFw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;according to IHME&lt;/a&gt;.

            Noncommunicable diseases now account for about two-thirds of global mortality and morbidity, including both deaths and broader burden from disease. Although mortality rates for heart disease and stroke have declined since 1990, rates have increased for diabetes, chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n00083b6nchela7zu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The rapid growth in the world’s aging population and evolving risk factors have ushered in a new era of global health challenges,” IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray said. “The evidence presented in the Global Burden of Disease study is a wake-up call, urging government and health care leaders to respond swiftly and strategically to the disturbing trends that are reshaping public health needs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n00093b6nzcei6u5u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About half of the world’s disease burden is preventable, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01637-X/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;, attributable to dozens of modifiable risk factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000a3b6nwwcl3gra@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity are among the 10 risk factors with the greatest effect, IHME found. Between 2010 and 2023, there was an 11% greater burden of disease due to high body mass index – measured by years of life lost due to disability or premature death – and a 6% increase due to high blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000b3b6nn64luxc9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Environmental factors such as particulate matter pollution and lead exposure were also among the most significant risk factors, along with those related to newborn health including low birthweight and short gestation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000c3b6ni77hsxvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, mental health plays a significant role in global mortality, according to the new research, with burden from anxiety and depression surging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000d3b6ncwalv4fx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the global population is growing and aging, death rates among children and young adults have increased in some parts of the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000e3b6nk0tpiggk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among adolescents and young adults, the largest increase in deaths over the past decade or so was among those ages 20 to 39 in high-income North America, mainly due to suicide, drug overdose and high quantities of alcohol, according to the IHME research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000f3b6nwqi3t8lw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deaths among those ages 5 to 19 also increased in Eastern Europe, high-income North America and the Caribbean, and among adolescents and young adults in sub-Saharan Africa, due to infectious diseases and unintentional injuries.

            Globally, for children 5 to 14, iron deficiency was the leading risk, followed by others related to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene and malnutrition. For the 15 to 49 age group, the top two risks were unsafe sex and occupational injuries, followed by high BMI, high systolic blood pressure and smoking.

            Overall, life expectancy ranged from as high as 83 years in high-income regions to as low as 62 years in sub-Saharan Africa, IHME found.

            This new research highlights an “urgent need for policymakers to expand health priorities,” IHME researchers said – especially among adolescents and young adults – rather than limiting resources.

            “Decades of work to close the gap in low-income regions with persistent health inequities are in danger of unraveling due to the recent cuts to international aid,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, senior author of the new studies&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and professor at IHME. “These countries rely on global health funding for life-saving primary care, medicine, and vaccines. Without it, the gap is sure to widen.”

For the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, researchers recruited 450 healthy volunteers in Germany. Of those, more than 99% had received the COVID-19 vaccine at least once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The participants were split into two groups: One used an azelastine nasal spray in each nostril at least three times a day for about 56 days.

Everyone was tested for COVID-19 twice a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The researchers discovered that people in the azelastine group were about three times less likely to contract COVID-19 compared to those in the placebo group. Ultimately, just five people in the azelastine group (or 2.2%) tested positive for the virus, while 15 (6.7%) tested positive in the placebo group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;People in the azelastine group also had a positive test for less time than their placebo-using counterparts (3.4 days compared to 5.14 days). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It doesn’t stop there: People in the azelastine group were also less likely to get any type of virus, including the common cold. The researchers discovered that 8.4% of people in the azelastine group contracted a virus compared to 18.8% in the placebo group.

You might reduce your risk of RSV and influenza as well,” he says. “There seems to be no risk to using the medications.” Though, more research is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Alan agrees, noting that there’s likely no harm to using azelastine as long as you’re not allergic to any of the ingredients in the nasal spray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Dr. Russo points out that it’s tricky to use a nasal spray several times a day. “The data suggest that if you use this three to five times a day, it may be similar to decreasing the likelihood of contracting COVID as getting the vaccine,” he says. “But it’s really hard to take a medication once a day, let alone five times a day.” For many people, it’s ultimately easier—and cheaper—to just get the vaccine, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Schaffner agrees. “Getting people to be compliant with this over the entire COVID season is substantial,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Dr. Russo says there may be some benefit in using azelastine before a big event. “You may think, ‘I’m going to a wedding and it’s going to be a high-risk situation.’ So, you might start taking this a few days beforehand and a few days afterward as extra protection,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;AS there’s no data comparing azelastine to more traditional methods of preventing COVID-19, like getting the vaccine and wearing masks, doctors recommend doing those first. “This should not be a substitute for vaccination,” Dr. Schaffner says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Adalja agrees. “In the best-case scenario, it will likely have a complementary role to vaccines—especially if shown to block infection, which vaccines against COVID are not able to do durably—and possibly provide protection against viruses for which there are no vaccines,” he says.

Drawing from more than 14 million website visits, researchers found that AI-related browsing made up less than one percent of online activity for most people. The study also indicates that individuals who use AI more often tend to exhibit certain aversive personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is growing public and academic interest in artificial intelligence, particularly its expanding role in education, work, and entertainment. While many surveys have asked people whether they use AI and how they feel about it, these self-reports are often unreliable. People tend to misjudge or misremember how often they use technology, especially newer forms like AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move beyond self-reported data, the researchers set out to directly measure AI use through people’s actual web browsing histories. Their goal was to determine how often AI tools are used in everyday life, identify who uses them the most, and examine what types of online activities are typically associated with AI use. Understanding the psychological traits linked to higher levels of AI interaction could help researchers and policymakers anticipate how different groups may adopt or resist AI technologies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been enormous public discussion about AI and its societal impact, but surprisingly little objective data on how people actually use it in their everyday browsing,” said study author &lt;a href="https://emilykmckinley.scholar.st/" target="_blank"&gt;Emily McKinley&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite widespread concerns and excitement about tools like ChatGPT, we had almost no baseline understanding of actual usage patterns. We wanted to measure what’s really happening, examining not just usage frequency, but also the psychological profiles of AI adopters and how AI integrates into their broader digital behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project included two separate studies. The first involved 499 university students from two institutions, while the second focused on 455 members of the general public. In both cases, participants shared their web browsing history over a period of up to 90 days. Only those who used Google Chrome were included, as this browser allowed for the necessary data export. Participants also completed surveys measuring their personality traits, attitudes toward AI, and demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a list of well-known AI websites, such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, the researchers identified which browser visits were AI-related. Other websites were categorized using a content classification system powered by a large language model. The researchers then analyzed the data to understand the proportion of AI visits relative to total browsing, what kinds of websites were visited immediately before and after using AI, and which psychological traits correlated with AI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the student sample, AI use made up just 1 percent of all website visits on average. Most participants rarely used AI at all, and only a small number accounted for the majority of the traffic. The most commonly visited AI site by far was ChatGPT, representing over 85 percent of all AI-related visits. While this use rate was higher than visits to web versions of some social media platforms like Instagram, it was far below the rate of search engine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were genuinely surprised by how infrequent AI use was, even among students who typically serve as early adopters of emerging technologies,” McKinley told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students who used AI more often were slightly more likely to score high on personality traits associated with narcissism and psychopathy. These individuals also tended to have more positive attitudes toward AI in general. There were some weak associations between AI use and demographics, such as income and gender, but age and ethnicity were not significantly related to AI use in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the general public sample showed even lower rates of AI use, with an average of just 0.44 percent of website visits being AI-related. Once again, ChatGPT was the most visited AI platform. Fewer significant correlations between personality and AI use were observed in this group, but there was a modest relationship between Machiavellianism and AI browsing. Those who expressed more favorable views of AI were also somewhat more likely to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers paid particular attention to individuals they called “prolific users,” defined as those whose AI browsing accounted for more than 4 percent of their total website visits. Among the student group, these prolific users scored much higher on measures of Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy compared to their peers. These patterns were less clear in the general public sample, possibly because AI use was less frequent overall, reducing the ability to detect meaningful differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, people who use AI more tend to score higher on aversive personality traits, particularly Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy, though these patterns were stronger among students,” McKinley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both groups, the researchers also analyzed what participants were doing online in the seconds before and after visiting an AI website. Before using AI, many were on internet and telecom sites, such as search engines and login pages. After AI use, participants were more likely to visit websites related to education, computers, or professional tasks. These patterns suggest that AI tools are often used as part of a workflow, especially in academic or job-related contexts. The researchers argue that this may point to AI being seen more as a productivity tool than a source of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding involved the gap between self-reported and actual AI use. In the general public sample, participants were asked how often they believed they used AI. The correlation between their estimates and their actual browsing data was moderate, suggesting that self-reports alone are not a reliable way to assess AI use. This result aligns with previous research on other forms of media, where people often underreport or overreport their habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study provides rare objective data on AI use, there are still some limitations. First, the analysis was limited to web-based interactions. Mobile app use, which may be more common for some users, was not included. Similarly, only Google Chrome users could participate, which may have influenced the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also focused primarily on a narrow set of individual traits, such as personality and basic demographics. Other factors, such as emotional well-being, motivations, or social environments, could play an important role in AI adoption but were not examined here. The team suggests that future studies should explore how these additional psychological and social variables relate to AI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note the importance of understanding what people are doing during their time on AI platforms. While this study captured how often users visited AI websites, it could not track whether they were writing essays, solving problems, or simply exploring out of curiosity. Capturing the content of interactions could shed light on the goals and intentions behind AI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, as AI becomes more integrated into daily life, usage patterns may change. The researchers plan to continue this line of inquiry by examining whether AI use is linked to specific outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to understand not just how often people use AI, but what they’re using it for and how that content relates to their individual characteristics,” McKinley explained. “We’re also interested in examining the downstream consequences of AI use: for example, does actual usage predict outcomes like academic integrity, information-seeking behaviors, or work performance?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research represents one of the first attempts to objectively quantify AI use in naturalistic settings using months of actual browsing data. While AI currently dominates many of our cultural conversations, the data suggest most people are still using it quite sparingly. The methodological approach we developed, combining passive digital trace data with psychological measures, offers a valuable template for future technology research, helping us move beyond the limitations of self-report and understand how individual differences shape technology adoption in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/21522715251379987" target="_blank"&gt;Evaluating Artificial Intelligence Use and Its Psychological Correlates via Months of Web-Browsing Data&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Emily McKinley, David M.

			&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-signal-of-dementia-risk-may-keep-you-up-at-night-study-says"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; can lead to improvements in care and in treatments, and a new study identifies a link between changes in brain shape and declines in cognitive functions – such as memory and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that some of the wear and tear that eventually leads to dementia can also alter the brain's structure and shape, and looking out for these shifts could be a relatively simple way of revealing dementia early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These new findings are from researchers at the University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine) and the University of La Laguna in Spain, and they build on what we already know about how the brain naturally shrinks &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/archneur.60.7.989"&gt;as we get older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-neuron-that-whispers-to-real-brain-cells-created-in-amazing-first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial Neuron That 'Whispers' to Real Brain Cells Created in Amazing First&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most studies of brain aging focus on how much tissue is lost in different regions," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/10/01/brain-shape-changes-could-offer-early-warning-signs-of-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Niels Janssen, from the University of La Laguna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we found is that the overall shape of the brain shifts in systematic ways, and those shifts are closely tied to whether someone shows cognitive impairment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176711" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176711" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BrainChart.jpg" alt="Brain chart" class="wp-image-176711 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BrainChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BrainChart-526x415.jpg 526w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BrainChart-600x474.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176711" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study charted brain structure changes across specific regions. (Escalante et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat.

A lot more data is going to be required to establish these relationships more precisely, but this study suggests they exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are further implications for neurodegenerative diseases &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, where brain damage accumulates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose that a crucial memory hub called the entorhinal cortex may be put under pressure by age-related shape shifts – and that's the same region where toxic proteins linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="176708" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; typically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/bjbs.2024.13169"&gt;start congregating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-177073" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could help explain why the entorhinal cortex is ground zero of Alzheimer's pathology," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/10/01/brain-shape-changes-could-offer-early-warning-signs-of-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Michael Yassa, from UC Irvine. "If the aging brain is gradually shifting in a way that squeezes this fragile region against a rigid boundary, it may create the perfect storm for damage to take root."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding that process gives us a whole new way to think about the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and the possibility of early detection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More brain scans and more precise measurements will help progress this research further. The team is keen to explore why some brain areas may expand with age and how this relates to cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway: it's evidence that it's not just the brain volume that matters in health and aging, but also the 3D shape of the brain – made up of many different regions all working together to keep our minds &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-many-crosswords-each-week-could-benefit-our-brains-as-we-age"&gt;sharp and active&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're just beginning to unlock how brain geometry shapes disease," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/10/01/brain-shape-changes-could-offer-early-warning-signs-of-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Yassa. "But this research shows that the answers may be hiding in plain sight – in the shape of the brain itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63628-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C is necessary for a healthy immune system, joints and disease prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average adult needs 75 mg to 90 mg per day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits, bell peppers and cruciferous veggies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It may take a sniffly nose, sneezing or a pesky cough to bring vitamin C to mind. Getting sick reminds us of our immune function, which may leave you wondering whether you should take vitamin C daily. Vitamin C is a well-known vitamin in citrus fruits that many people turn to when under the weather. That's because it can enhance immune health and may reduce the length of a cold.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But immune function isn't the only thing vitamin C is necessary for. It's also a crucial nutrient and antioxidant that aids in producing compounds that support different body functions. So, can you benefit from taking a regular vitamin C supplement? Read on to learn more about what happens when you take vitamin C every day.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it's common to find bare shelves of vitamin C during flu season, how it impacts immunity is unclear. That said, we do know the skin needs normal levels of vitamin C to maintain a healthy barrier to keep harmful pathogens from entering the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is also present in immune cells, so having sufficient levels is vital. Low levels of vitamin C could make you more susceptible to sickness. As an antioxidant, vitamin C protects cells from oxidative damage and regulates anti-inflammatory pathways, helping reduce inflammation and, therefore, the risk of chronic health conditions.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consuming vitamin C may help alleviate lead exposure. Lead is a heavy metal found in some paint, jewelry, soil and other products that is poisonous in high concentrations. Even the most minor blood levels of lead can impact how well a child performs in school. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, routinely eating foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin C may help keep lead out of the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, more research is needed to understand the beneficial effects.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to one small study, iron deficiency is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Populations most at risk are infants, young children, pregnant people and females of reproductive age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The CDC recommends improving iron absorption by pairing an iron-rich food with a vitamin C-rich food, such as mandarin oranges with salad greens.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And some studies have seen significant differences in iron levels when supplementing with vitamin C and iron compared to iron alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is especially true of non-heme iron, the type of iron found in plants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is necessary to form collagen, a vital part of connective tissue, which helps mend wounds. While research is mixed on this topic, many studies support vitamin C supplementation for reducing pain and inflammation related to osteoarthritis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is partly due to vitamin C's role in collagen formation, as well as its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to vitamin C's powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, there is evidence that it may act as an anti-tumor agent.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers note that vitamin C is not a replacement for traditional cancer treatment, but an adjunct to it. When used in this way, it may improve treatment results.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is evidence that vitamin C protects neurons (brain cells) against oxidative stress and may be helpful to mental health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, one study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that older adults with higher vitamin C intake had lower rates of cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers note that these benefits plateaued at about 500 mg/day of vitamin C, suggesting that more than this offers no further brain benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people have sufficient vitamin C intake because many consume foods naturally rich in vitamin C or fortified with it. Yet, others may need more. According to the National Cancer Institute, 7% of people in the U.S. have scurvy, a condition where vitamin C levels fall below normal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Scurvy happens from eating too few vitamin C sources or impaired absorption in the digestive tract. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Symptoms of vitamin C deficiency include:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How much vitamin C you need depends on your age, sex and whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding. The average adult male needs 90 mg per day, while the average adult female needs 75 mg per day. If you're pregnant, you need 85 mg per day, and if you're breastfeeding, shoot for 120 mg per day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While oranges tend to be the go-to for vitamin C, this nutrient hangs out in lots of nourishing sources, with many of them &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052728/6-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;having more vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; than an orange.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The recommended daily amount of vitamin C for adults is 90 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Overloading yourself with vitamin C is unlikely, since our body rids what it can't use in urine, but it is still possible to overdo it. For example, digestive upset, including stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea, commonly occurs when unabsorbed vitamin C is in the intestines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High vitamin C levels can cause increases in oxalates, which make you more prone to kidney stones, especially for people with poor kidney function. For example, one review reports that vitamin C doses greater than 1 gram may increase the chances of stone formation by 41%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The same review reported that women taking too much vitamin C during pregnancy could result in rebound scurvy in newborn babies. Excess vitamin C may also affect vitamin B12 and copper levels and cause dental enamel erosion. Because of these health risks, an upper limit for adults ages 19 and up is 2,000 mg daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, some people may be taking more under the supervision of a medical provider.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vitamin-c-supplements-8686368" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C supplements&lt;/a&gt; in various forms, such as powders, gummies, chewable tablets, non-chewable tablets and capsules. When looking for one, consider what form of vitamin C will help you be consistent. If mixing powdered vitamin C with water isn't for you, you might choose chewable. If you dislike swallowing pills, you may enjoy gummies, but if you are sensitive to added sugar, you might opt for a capsule. Choose the form that works best for your lifestyle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Take a close look at supplement ingredient lists to pinpoint any additives it may have, such as artificial colors, added sugars, preservatives or fillers. And while the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;doesn't regulate supplements&lt;/a&gt;, you can still take steps to ensure your supplement is reliable, safe and effective. Independent labeling can help identify a trustworthy supplement. USP, NSF and ConsumerLabs are examples of independent labels to seek on the packaging or bottle to help ensure you're getting honest ingredients.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements can be costly, and a routine daily dose of a vitamin C supplement isn't necessary for healthy people, since most people have healthy vitamin C levels. Talk to your healthcare provider first if you're considering taking a vitamin C supplement. Otherwise, if you're concerned about getting enough vitamin C foods, simply turn to your local market and stock up on vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables. Whether fresh, frozen or canned, produce like pineapple, potatoes and bell peppers are plentiful in vitamin C, and enjoying more of them can meet your everyday needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C can be safe to take daily; however, it's helpful to know that you can meet your daily needs by eating vitamin C-rich foods. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-kiwi-8650515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a half-cup of kiwi&lt;/a&gt; offers 134 mg of vitamin C, which provides 148% to 178% of the recommended daily needs. Before taking any new supplements, it's best practice to speak with your medical provider and stay below the upper limit for vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing beats getting vitamin C from whole foods, which is the ultimate form. Many foods are brimming with vitamin C, like citrus fruits, cruciferous veggies and potatoes. If you're still interested in a vitamin C supplement, the best form to take is synthetic ascorbic acid and the presentation you can easily ingest, which for some could be a mixable powder and, for others, an easy-to-swallow capsule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

"With so few new drug candidates in the first place, we need a significant investment in antibiotic development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found a preponderance of Gram-negative bacteria causing infections in newborns at these hospitals. Due to the structure of their cell envelope, Gram-negative bacteria have an in-built resistance to some antibiotics, and are generally &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25061340"&gt;more likely to develop antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt; than Gram-positive species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="alignnone wp-image-177073 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction arises from their different responses to the Gram staining test, which is used to divide bacterial species into these two broad groups based on properties of their cell walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abundant Gram-negative bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter&lt;/em&gt; were responsible for nearly 80 percent of infections studied, the authors report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176832" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176832" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/BacteriaFoundInBloodSamples.jpg" alt="Graph showing proportion of infections caused by different types of bacteria and fungi.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A recent study out of the University of Padua in Italy found microplastics in nearly all dairy products tested — including milk, fresh cheese, and ripened cheese.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The researchers found an average of 1,857 particles per kilogram in ripened cheese, 1,280 in fresh cheese, and about 350 in milk, likely from processing and packaging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the study didn’t evaluate health effects, previous research links microplastics to heart and liver issues, raising concerns about plastic contamination in the food supply.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Microplastics are turning up just about everywhere in the global food supply, including in &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-in-seafood-study-8773102" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, cups of &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-in-tea-bags-study-8770478" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt;, and even in &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-detected-in-vegetable-tissue-university-of-plymouth-study-2025-11816039" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt; freshly plucked from the ground. And now, a recent peer-reviewed study published in the journal&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-025-00506-8" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;em&gt;NPJ&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Science of Food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says they're swirling around in our milk, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Italy’s University of Padua shared their findings after analyzing microplastics in dairy products, including milk, fresh cheese, and ripened cheese. The team examined 28 retail samples, including cartons of milk, 10 fresh cheeses aged less than one month, and 14 ripened cheeses aged more than four months. The researchers minimized cross-contamination risk by conducting their tests in a "Class 7 cleanroom" and using cleaned glassware, ensuring that any microplastics detected were present from the start.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team then separated the dairy from any potential microplastic particles and used a powerful infrared microscope to identify each piece, scanning them repeatedly to confirm the results. Unsurprisingly, they found microplastic particles in 26 out of 28 products tested, most often identifying polyethylene terephthalate, also known as&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polyethylene-terephthalate#:~:text=Polyethylene%20terephthalate%20%28PET%29%20is%20a%20polymer%20produced%20through%20the%20polymerization,environmental%20impact%20of%20PET%20packaging." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; PET&lt;/a&gt;, a plastic commonly used in food packaging and plastic bottles, along with&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/polyethylene#:~:text=In%20subject%20area:%20Materials%20Science,How%20useful%20is%20this%20definition?" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; polyethylene&lt;/a&gt;, the most widely used plastic, and&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/polypropylene#:~:text=Polypropylene%20%28PP%29%20is%20a%20common,would%20occupy%20landfills%20during%20disposal." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; polypropylene&lt;/a&gt;, a thermoplastic polymer also frequently used in food packaging.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team found significantly more microplastics in cheese than in milk. Ripened cheese had the highest levels, about 1,857 particles per kilogram, followed by fresh cheese at 1,280 particles per kilogram, and milk with around 350 particles per kilogram. The researchers noted that the difference between cheese and milk was substantial enough to be considered meaningful. Their findings suggest the additional microplastics are likely introduced during processing, due to the additional steps involved in pressing, aging, and packaging cheese, including everything from feed bags to retail wrappers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As the authors noted, this study merely documented the presence of microplastics; it did not analyze or seek to understand the health effects on people consuming them. However, a growing body of research is pointing to the potential harm of microplastics to human health. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Food &amp;amp; Wine has reported on numerous microplastic studies, including one that showed microplastics can&lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-found-in-arteries-linked-to-cardiovascular-disease-11808981" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; build up in the arterial plaque&lt;/a&gt; of patients with cardiovascular disease. The researchers in that study noted that these micro- and nanoplastics can trigger "toxicologic effects" when they enter the human body through "ingestion, inhalation, and skin exposure." They added that the microscopic particles pose a risk factor for various conditions, including "altered heart rate, cardiac-function impairment, myocardial fibrosis, and endothelial dysfunction," along with general oxidative stress and inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;

Using a mouse model, researchers observed that male mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 before mating produced offspring who exhibited higher levels of anxiety-like behaviours. These changes were linked to alterations in non-coding RNA in sperm, which play a key role in regulating gene expression. Female offspring also showed significant changes in gene activity in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for anxiety and mood regulation.

While further studies are needed in humans, these results suggest the pandemic could have long-lasting effects on future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How COVID-19 affects sperm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that COVID-19 infection can alter various RNA molecules in sperm, including non-coding RNAs that regulate how genes are expressed. These RNAs act as molecular instructions, guiding offspring development and brain function. Changes in these molecules due to viral infection can potentially influence neurological development and behaviour in offspring. According to Professor Anthony Hannan, the study is the first to show that SARS-CoV-2 infection before conception can directly impact sperm in ways that affect the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evidence from mouse studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In controlled experiments, male mice were allowed to recover from COVID-19 for several weeks before mating with healthy females. The resulting offspring consistently displayed increased anxiety-like behaviours compared to offspring from uninfected fathers. Detailed analysis revealed significant gene activity changes in the hippocampus, the brain’s region responsible for regulating emotion, stress response, and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female offspring showed particularly strong alterations in genes linked to affective behaviours. First author Dr. Elizabeth Kleeman explained that these findings demonstrate how viral infections in males can indirectly shape brain development in their children. The research has been published in Nature Communications, emphasizing its contribution to epigenetic science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implications for future generations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study raises important questions about the long-term consequences of COVID-19 beyond those directly infected. Professor Hannan noted that if similar effects occur in humans, millions of children could be impacted worldwide, with potential implications for mental health and development. These findings underscore the importance of understanding COVID-19 not just as an acute illness but as a factor that may influence reproductive health and the well-being of future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of epigenetics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research highlights the concept of epigenetic inheritance, where environmental factors, including viral infections, can alter molecular information in sperm. Such changes can influence the next generation without altering the DNA sequence itself. Dr. Carolina Gubert, co-senior author, explained that modifications in sperm RNA can transmit instructions that shape brain development, stress response, and behavioural traits in offspring. This finding builds on previous knowledge that factors like diet and stress can have similar transgenerational effects, showing that COVID-19 may add another layer of influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;br&gt;Next steps in research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study provides compelling evidence in mice, further research is needed to understand if the same mechanisms occur in humans. Researchers aim to examine sperm from men who have recovered from COVID-19 and study any potential behavioural or neurological impacts on their children. Understanding these effects could help shape public health guidelines, reproductive advice, and early interventions to mitigate long-term consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 08:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgJBVV95cUxNZWZ5c3VRNjVEX3BFbjBEejRpZ05fUmwzSm42MC1ndXNucXBZSlduMzQtNDBqdjN3ZDkwczhHaUJOeUM5bUg4UlJWa29oUDFOak54ZmhXQV9MN2FpempOek1DbXBLVndZN3VXamFON1B0OHBQS1J4eWVrNHBlX2Q2Wk5DalgySk9jV3NTTDM3ejFxYVowMmRNNzVwV0tMUVgzUzhtWkZaMWJzTW5QRHdyTER0YW85d1FNUFJseGZzQTVMc3ZaT1FiVlI0VVp1LUdjenlVOHNQVS1ibFhudHZUbWJpNGFWZnozQmNWcy1WWlRzbkhvY0RZbTQwc2tZdkpQbE9yRWM3cE1HTURWa2FnU21TSXNmMzBpbWJ6ZFN0d0JKWndHd2c</guid></item><item><title>美国心脏病专家说，这是将心脏病风险降低一半的最强大工具！ -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/want-to-cut-heart-disease-diabetes-and-cognitive-decline-risk-by-half-us-cardiologist-says-this-is-the-most-powerful-tool/articleshow/124496519.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered if we can somehow reduce the risk of lifestyle diseases like heart, diabetes, and cognitive decline, by as much as half? No, there is no magical pill, but the answer lies in your very own body. Yes, that is right! Movement is one of the most powerful tools for anti-ageing, and reducing the risk of major chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline. Dr. Sanjay Bhojraj, a US cardiologist with 20 years of experience, emphasises that how we move daily is more important than complex health fads or medicine cabinets. Let’s dig deeper…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why movement is the most powerful anti-ageing tool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bhojraj highlights that over 80% of chronic diseases are driven by lifestyle factors - how we move, eat, sleep, and manage stress. Among these, intentional movement is the “most powerful anti-ageing tool” we have. It does not mean intense workouts only; any movement that challenges your muscles and lungs teaches your cells to stay strong and alive. This sets the foundation for healthier ageing. He says, “How you move, eat, sleep, and manage stress determines far more about your longevity than what’s in your medicine cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Why are women more at risk for heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet… most people start at the pharmacy instead of with their physiology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How movement cuts disease risk by 50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Bhojraj, regular strength and aerobic exercises can lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline by up to half. This is huge because no medicine can come close to providing these benefits. The movement signals to the mitochondria in your cells - your energy engines to thrive on oxygen and sunlight, powering your longevity naturally. According to Dr Bhojraj, “Studies show consistent strength and aerobic training can lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline by up to 50%. No pill comes close to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Walking: A simple yet powerful step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need fancy equipment or a gym membership. Dr. Bhojraj points out that consistent daily walking can bring remarkable heart benefits. Walking 10,000 steps or even 20 to 30 minutes daily helps regulate blood pressure, improves circulation, and supports healthy heart rhythms. A study shows that walking daily can reduce heart disease risk by nearly 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Movement is key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movement is not just physical; it also lowers cortisol, the body’s main stress hormone. High cortisol harms the heart and brain. Regular movement eases stress, improving mood and cognitive function. Slower walking pace or lack of movement correlates with higher risks of depression, anxiety, and memory issues, while regular movement protects brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Movement is for everyone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bhojraj encourages integrating movement into daily life in any form—walking, yoga, swimming, or strength training. The message is clear: “To age well, start here, not at the pharmacy.” He further added, “That’s not a hack—it’s how your body was designed to heal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswJBVV95cUxPc1Z6ZVh6eU5UOFlZS0JGU0dfWmswcklxNnNTZUFibGM1TDRKV3E5Q1BjZzEwRE5UTHVYaEt1QzBicXNoOWlEZFo4aEx3SVh1d1NJRFlZSVJwYU9MMXhRWms5MUp6YzJMOWRDYTB4YmtTYjlEaE9RTDdWWnBKbWNwTEphMno2ZDc2QWR6SG1VelZQT2NsRjRQWWd4NVRQaktYUzRKZzd1RE40bFRmUW5RbFVGNzNPTXV5LWh1d0Y4RXdzWFVQZUdUTFp5Tnh6M1lSOUl3c25pTDM5NHNCS2FndG5YRkNZTjNuUE5PRzdieGtVRDcyRkhkOEY2NHFEeF9Ib0JJcG9Kc1RKbUNSR1ZHVnRfdnBmMWh1ZGloZWN6OVd6c2NkbFZ5eE9QVkdDTlpHOEdj</guid></item><item><title>更年期可能对您的眼睛产生的惊人影响- HuffPost UK</title><link>https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/menopause-dry-eyes_uk_68e7b0f2e4b0b4458cb736f2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might associate menopause with a few symptoms: hot flushes, disrupted sleep and changes to your libido, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/62-menopause-symptoms-explained_uk_6756fb9ee4b0a775f3921f26" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="other side effects" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68e7b0f2e4b0b4458cb736f2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6756fb9ee4b0a775f3921f26" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;other side effects&lt;/a&gt;, like a frozen shoulder, tinnitus, and a burning mouth, are lesser-known side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that’s because &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2023/apr/nine-ten-women-were-never-educated-about-menopause" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="more than 90% of women" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68e7b0f2e4b0b4458cb736f2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2023/apr/nine-ten-women-were-never-educated-about-menopause" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;more than 90% of women&lt;/a&gt;

– Over-the-counter eye drops can relieve dryness.

Here are the six worst grocery store hot dogs, according to shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gwaltney Great Dogs Original&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwaltney claims these are &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gwaltney-Original-Chicken-Hot-Dogs-Bun-Size-3-lb/10452733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“America’s No. 1 chicken hot dog,”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;“America’s No. 1 chicken hot dog,”&lt;/a&gt; and their main selling point is that they have 40% less fat than regular beef hot dogs. They’re marketed as a lighter, affordable option, and you’ll usually find them at places like Walmart, Food Lion, and other big grocery chains for about $1.50 to $2 a pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you’re actually getting is a hot dog made mostly of mechanically separated chicken, with some pork, water, corn syrup, and generic “flavorings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re not big in the flavor department either — and judging by Reddit, people have some strong feelings about that. “They are absolutely horrific and the way they look in the frying pan is disturbing me to my core,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/1fujwa2/comment/lpzzhrr/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said one Redditor.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said one Redditor.&lt;/a&gt;“They’re the second worst hot dog I’ve ever had the displeasure of biting into and then promptly spitting into a napkin and throwing away,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/1fujwa2/comment/lpzx4t8/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adds another.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adds another.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;FUD Hot Dogs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll mostly find them at Walmart and select grocery stores, especially in areas with a large Hispanic customer base. They’re priced in the low-to-mid range, usually around $2.50 to $3 a pack, but you’re mostly paying for disappointment. These are made from mechanically separated chicken and pork, with salt, flavoring, and sodium lactate to round out the flavorless parade. Reddit users have roasted FUD consistently for years — many say they couldn’t even finish the pack. The texture is rubbery, the taste is bland and off-putting, and even boiling doesn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bar-S Classic and Beef Franks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bar-S is an ultra-budget brand owned by Sigma (yes, same as FUD), and it’s one of the top-selling hot dog brands in America, not because it’s good, but because it’s dirt cheap. You can find it everywhere from Walmart to Dollar General, usually under $1.50 per pack. It’s also one of the most hated hot dog brands out there. The classic franks are made with mechanically separated chicken and turkey, with a little pork thrown in and beef hearts for flair. Ingredients include corn syrup, sodium nitrite, and potassium lactate. On Reddit and Chowhound, they’re called “possessed,” “mushy,” “too sweet,” and “unsettling in texture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bar s dogs of all flavors are like eating marshmallow meat and they don’t get plump when you cook them”&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kg2waog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one Redditor said.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one Redditor said.&lt;/a&gt; “Mystery meat dogs at their worst.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oscar Mayer Classic Wieners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oscar Mayer proudly claims their hot dogs have “no fillers,” which feels a bit rich when you flip the package over and see what’s actually in them. The ingredient list starts with mechanically separated chicken and turkey, plus some pork, which translates to mystery meat and a long scroll of additives like sodium phosphate, sodium benzoate, and sodium nitrite. This isn’t exactly a clean label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find these just about everywhere — Target, Kroger, Safeway — for around $3.50 to $5 a pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do have a nostalgic fan base, but they are also wildly roasted on Reddit for being the “default bad hot dog.” ​​I sometimes think about buying Oscar Mayers hot dogs then I see them on the shelf and I look at their color and then always pass,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kg9k6hj/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one user sums it up.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one user sums it up.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ball Park Franks (Regular and Grillmaster)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ball Park is everywhere — Costco, CVS, your neighbor’s Fourth of July cookout. Owned by Tyson Foods, the brand has been around forever and sells a dizzying number of varieties. The regular franks are made from a blend of mechanically separated chicken and pork, corn syrup, and a long list of preservatives. They’re soft, overly sweet, and don’t grill particularly well. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kgglubl/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one Redditor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one Redditor&lt;/a&gt;. “They taste like what you imagine hot dog water tastes like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beef versions, especially the Grillmaster line, get noticeably more respect. They’re made with actual beef — no mystery meats — and they cook up with better texture and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jennie-O Turkey Franks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennie-O is known for turkey, but these franks don’t do the brand any favors. They show up in most grocery stores — Safeway, Meijer, Albertsons — for around $3 to $4 a pack, and they’re sold as the “healthier” option. But low fat doesn’t mean much when the end result is dry, dense, and painfully bland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ingredients aren’t great either — mechanically separated turkey, water, corn syrup, and not much else. No real seasoning to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More Hot Dog Stories From Cheapism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 06:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5PbnZ3OVNkT21YS3F6dml2OW1zYXFaeWZxck9aSVI4bnI3VV8tUjY1MVVWeDBTajUxcnBWMENneU9CQjFqSXhoUEoyMWhyVUZWWi1xemRJS3RNbXZaUTNhY1p5R0dZdzFoYjAtTUhmOWxsdm8</guid></item><item><title>一位长寿专家说，压力会加速您的衰老速度-这是他为降低压力水平而做的两件事- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/wellness/a-longevity-expert-says-stress-accelerates-how-fast-you-age-these-are-the-two-things-he-does-to-reduce-his-stress-levels</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

This is the type of stress you experience consistently, for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kaeberlein, it’s not uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people have chronic stress, and it’s really the chronic stress that is detrimental to your health,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-figure-out-if-you-have-chronic-stress" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-figure-out-if-you-have-chronic-stress"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to figure out if you have chronic stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="ea64ce5f-4bb9-4fb6-8ea0-c28207e9e25d"&gt;Knowing whether or not you have chronic stress is simply a matter of identifying whether or not you’re regularly stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need complicated devices. I think most people, if they are in touch with themselves, can tell if they are stressed or not,” Kaeberlein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling to identify your emotions, some devices can help you keep tabs on your stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a growing number of tools [and metrics] that we can use to estimate whether somebody is experiencing an unhealthy level of chronic stress. Heart rate variability is a good example,” Kaeberlein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="190a0464-bfcf-4614-9741-3626074089be"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images/ andreswd)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="7f91da29-251c-4d9f-b6d6-24c92ea477a0"&gt;Fitness trackers from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/apple" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Oura and Garmin offer heart rate variability tests. These aren’t 100% accurate, but they can show you trends in your heart rate variability and give you a general indication of stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a more sophisticated test, Kaeberlein recommends a device called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://trainwithmorpheus.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://trainwithmorpheus.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Morpheus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can measure it well, [heart rate variability] is actually a really powerful biomarker for understanding whether somebody is experiencing chronic stress at a level that is unhealthy for them,” says Kaeberlein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-two-ways-that-dr-matt-kaeberlein-reduced-his-stress-levels" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-two-ways-that-dr-matt-kaeberlein-reduced-his-stress-levels"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two ways that Dr Matt Kaeberlein reduced his stress levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="f15d2c6d-b820-4b6f-b259-d5498c1f1783"&gt;If you are experiencing stress, it's a good idea to speak to a healthcare professional. But there are also things you can do in your daily life to reduce stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anything that we can do to learn how to manage that stress will have a positive impact on our health going forward,” says Kaeberlein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaeberlein says there are two key things he's done to reduce his stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="90e4c41d-888e-4ea8-b375-b950ce3d9019"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images/ FG Trade Latin)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-exercise" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-exercise"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="4a956172-4724-4c8c-a98d-cf374bdb56b5"&gt;Regular exercise has lots of benefits, but many people don't realise it's also a great stress-buster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lifting weights is a great stress management tool,” says Kaeberlein, revealing that this is the main form of exercise he does. “I exercise regularly. That's something that I obviously believe is very important for health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-limit-social-media" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-limit-social-media"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Limit social media &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="9f93f325-1138-4c7e-9792-4d8cd30f3772"&gt;“In our daily lives, in the world that we live in today, we are overwhelmed with information and stimuli,” says Kaeberlein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's a variety of aspects to how social media can cause stress. One is how much negative information is on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The constant underlying negative feelings or negative information that you’re experiencing drives chronic release of hormones like cortisol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, Kaeberlein says that he tries to limit the amount he uses social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tend to stay off of social media, and I tend not to consume a lot of news right now,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

Drinking methi water every day for a month can be extremely powerful due to the rich nutrients and bioactive compounds, present in fenugreek seeds. Here are 5 important changes that can occur in the body with regular methi water consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Better digestion and gut health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soluble fiber in methi water absorbs water to create a stomach gel that slows down digestion, and treats bloating and acidity and constipation. The prebiotic properties of methi water support beneficial gut bacteria, which leads to better nutrient absorption and improved overall gut health. The digestive system of many people improves after using methi water for several weeks which leads to reduced stomach problems and regular bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to reduce your sugar intake without feeling deprived: 9 foods for managing diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Stable blood sugar levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8344183/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; has shown that methi water effectively controls blood sugar levels in the body. The galactomannans and 4-hydroxyisoleucine compounds in fenugreek seeds, work together to decrease sugar absorption rates while enhancing insulin receptor sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes along with those who have diabetes risk factors can benefit from this remedy because it helps control blood sugar levels and reduces peak blood sugar values. Doctor-supervised patients who use methi water regularly, might need to take their medication at lower doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Weight management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiber content in methi water creates a feeling of fullness which helps people eat less and control their food cravings. The combination of natural appetite suppression and metabolic enhancement through methi water consumption, leads to weight management by stopping excessive eating and enhancing fat breakdown. The combination of healthy eating and exercise with regular methi water consumption, leads to steady weight reduction during a thirty-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Healthier skin and hair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in methi water work to enhance skin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-of-fenugreek" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by fighting acne while creating a radiant and clear complexion. The liquid from methi water provides essential nutrients to hair follicles, which helps control dandruff and strengthens hair to stop hair loss. Users who drink methi water regularly experience decreased skin problems and improved hair quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart health and lower cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking methi water daily has been proven to decrease levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, which benefits heart health. The beneficial effects of methi water consumption work to clear arteries while decreasing the chances of developing cardiovascular diseases. Regular consumption of methi water as part of a balanced lifestyle helps create better cholesterol numbers which protects against heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Precautions and side effects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methi water provides various health advantages yet some users experience adverse reactions including stomach problems and allergic responses and diarrhea. Women who are pregnant should stay away from drinking methi water, since it increases the chances of miscarriage. People with low potassium levels or specific medical conditions need to consult their doctor before using methi water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How to prepare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People need to soak 1-2 teaspoons of fenugreek seeds in water throughout an entire night before straining the liquid in the morning for an empty stomach consumption.

Dr Saurabh Sethi, MD, MPH, a gastroenterologist and &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fortis-vasant-kunj-hepatologist-warns-1-in-every-3-people-suffer-from-fatty-liver-shares-best-foods-for-liver-health-101760161645355.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="hepatologist"&gt;hepatologist &lt;/a&gt;trained at AIIMS, Stanford and Harvard Universities, highlighted the 5 early signs that indicate an unhealthy gut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5 early signs of an unhealthy gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an Instagram post dated October 12, Dr Sethi shared the 5 signs of having an unhealthy gut, with the caption, “Board-certified &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/gastroenterologist-shares-5-healthy-morning-drinks-better-than-coffee-or-tea-from-amla-juice-to-jeera-water-101759997240419.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="gastroenterologist"&gt;gastroenterologist &lt;/a&gt;shares 5 Early Signs of an Unhealthy Gut. Which of these signs have you noticed in yourself?” Let's find out:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Funhealthy gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the gastroenterologist trained at AIIMS, if you're always feeling gassy or bloated after meals, it could mean your gut bacteria are imbalanced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Irregular bowel movements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stating irregular bowel movements as a sign of an unhealthy gut, the gastroenterologist said, “Chronic constipation or diarrhoea is often your gut's way of signalling trouble.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Unexplained fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor gut health affects nutrient absorption, leaving you tired even after proper rest,” Dr Saurabh Sethi pointed out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Food intolerances&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If certain foods trigger discomfort, according to the gastroenterologist, your gut microbiome may be struggling to process them properly, which can be an early sign of compromised gut health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Weakened immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a weakened immunity is also an early sign of an unhealthy gut. Dr Sethi noted, “70 percent of your immune system lives in your gut. Frequent colds or infections can mean your gut needs attention.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

This number is projected to increase by 73% by 2040, resulting in approximately 1.6 million deaths per year, according to the WHO. This type of cancer is becoming increasingly common in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;young people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, and factors including lifestyle play a crucial role. While certain foods can increase the risk of colon cancer, some others can reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine eating some delicious snack and protecting yourself from colon cancer. Yes, you read it right. An indulgent snack and its key ingredient are linked to reduced risk and recurrence of colon cancer. An observational study found that the chance of colon cancer recurrence was nearly cut in half in people who eat nuts and nut butter. The findings are published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5891130/#s8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in India and it’s fully treatable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basic healthy eating can often be overlooked during cancer treatment. This study demonstrates that a simple dietary change, such as eating tree nuts, may have a significant impact on a patient's long-term survival. Nut consumption and a healthy diet are generally factors that clinicians and patients should perhaps pay attention to as they design the approach to treatment for colorectal cancer," ASCO President Daniel F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes, MD, FACP, FASCO, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observational study examined 826 patients with stage III colon cancer. They found that nuts, especially peanuts, had a profound impact on colon cancer. In patients who consumed two ounces or more of nuts per week, they saw a 42% lower chance of cancer recurrence and a 57% lower chance of death than those who did not eat nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the benefit of nut consumption was limited to tree nuts in a secondary analysis. These include almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews, and pecans, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Numerous studies in the fields of heart disease and diabetes have shown the benefits of nut consumption, and we felt that it was important to determine if these benefits could also apply to colorectal cancer patients," Temidayo Fadelu, MD, a clinical fellow in medicine at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and lead author, said. "Patients with advanced disease who benefit from chemotherapy frequently ask what else they can do to reduce their chances of recurrence or death, and our study is an important contribution to the idea that modifying diet and physical activity can be beneficial," Fadelu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed no associated reduction in cancer recurrence and death among patients who consumed peanuts or peanut butter. It could be because being legumes, peanuts have a different metabolic composition than tree nuts, the authors said. Also, peanuts are by far the most widely consumed nut in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with stage III colon cancer have up to a 70% chance of surviving three years after treatment, which typically includes surgery and/or chemotherapy. Though previous studies have looked at the role of diet as a potential cancer prevention role, this is the first to examine the benefits of nuts in treating colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, the researchers analyzed a questionnaire from a CALGB clinical trial of patients with stage III colon cancer that began in 1999. They asked about the patients’ dietary intake, including whether or not patients ate nuts and what types of nuts they consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were eager to know about nut consumption, as it is already linked to lower incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and a reduction in insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on the associations between overall nut consumption and just tree nut consumption and the risk of cancer recurrence and death. They found that patients who consumed two or more ounces of all types of nuts per week (19% of all patients in the study) had a 42% lower chance of cancer recurrence and a 57% lower chance of death than those patients who did not eat nuts after completion of their cancer treatment. In people who reported tree nut consumption, the chance of recurrence was 46% lower and the chance of death was 53% lower in those who ate at least two ounces per week, compared to those who didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Trump Undergoes Mystery Health Checkup At Walter Reed Amid Growing Speculations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the experts saying?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree nuts consumption can be crucial in both preventing and cutting the risk of recurrence of colon cancer. "It should be emphasized that the authors are not suggesting that eating nuts should be considered a substitute for standard chemotherapy and other treatments for colon cancer, which have dramatically improved survival. Rather, patients with colon cancer should be optimistic, and they should eat a healthy diet, including tree nuts, which may not only keep them healthier, but may also further decrease the chances of the cancer coming back," Dr. Hayes said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to look at the potential positive impact of nut consumption on survival at other stages of colon cancer, particularly stage IV. Ultimately, we need to understand how nuts confer this protective effect, as well as possibly conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial where diet recommendations are given at the start of the study to prove that tree nuts can reduce recurrence and death after treatment for colon cancer," Dr. Fadelu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 01:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxQck1lTDdRN25kdm1MT3pNQWR3NUZsaTB3NTd0UVU2ajJJSHZPN0M4aWE0SkJFQUpUekFYbnBZYzdNaEM1Q2pEeVdLQlVKblIzd1JOcEgtNEdMNmVvY0laZVdnR3RiM0tjcGc5NkJ3eG9ROFlXZzFwb2NMOFZPV3YzLU9uSWxZMTN1UXhPS1dUWnVFMnlZSXgxQkRiTFpZXzJ0azZHUDVnMVM1M0p1emVwV2FSSG5JSUVHMl9uemxYYi1iTHVXazNkVUdtcFV5UnZuTlRRT09TbDhXSzF2OXNHOFl1cFlxRHNUaDBwOFdDQzc</guid></item><item><title>又一场大流行即将来临？致命疾病袭击日本，超过4000人住院，学校因...而关闭，最高- india.com</title><link>https://www.india.com/news/world/another-pandemic-coming-deadly-disease-hits-japan-over-4000-hospitalised-due-to-influenza-schools-kindergartens-childcare-centres-closed-highest-case-reported-in-okinawa-prefecture-8127388/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="expandheight"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The world has not yet moved on from the deadly COVID-19 pandemic that caused global shutdowns, left lives in disarray, and millions dead across the planet. Now, as countries continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan is facing another health crisis: a sudden outbreak of seasonal influenza.  Reports suggest that over 4,000 people have already been infected, and the numbers will likely continue to climb as the temperature decreases daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s Ministry of Health announced an epidemic on October 3 after 4,030 people were treated for influenza at country-designated medical institutions in the week starting September 22 – an increase of 957 cases from the previous week. Citing Japan’s Ministry of Health, Japan Today reported that this is the second time in 20 years that an early seasonal change has led to a widespread outbreak of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;According to the Japan Today report, approximately 3,000 hospitals nationwide reported a combined 4,030 flu patients during the seven-day period through Sunday. The highest number of flu patients per hospital is reported in Okinawa Prefecture. Tokyo and Kagoshima have also witnessed higher numbers of flu patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-india-v0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, the number of patients exceeds the epidemic threshold, with an average of 1.04 patients per medical institution. The infection spread rapidly among children. In that same timeframe, 135 schools, kindergartens, and childcare centres were closed due to outbreaks among children, which was three times the number reported in the same week last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PreferredSources-content"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Add India.com as a Preferred Source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i class="google-preferred-source-btn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=https://www.india.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="lazy" data-src="https://static.india.com/wp-content/themes/icommobile/images/google-preferred-source-btn-mobile.png" src="https://static.india.com/wp-content/themes/icom/images/cwv-icon/1x1.svg" alt="Add India.com as a Preferred Source"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="cre_render_news" class="cre_render_news"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the flu season in Japan occurs from December to March. Last season began in early November, peaked just before New Year’s, and was called over by April. Due to the rising cases, the Ministry has urged the public to exercise caution and practice preventive behaviors, which include handwashing and wearing masks. The specific strain has not been identified yet, and officials have suggested vaccination for young children, the elderly, and/or those with comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While speaking to the South China Morning Post, Professor Yoko Tsukamoto from the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido said, “The flu season has started really early this year, but in the changing global environment this might become a more common scenario.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;According to health officials and scientists, there are several reasons behind the surge. One important factor has been the return of mass international tourism in the post-pandemic environment, which has greatly increased the movement of people, and therefore, the movement of viruses, across national borders.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing a greater circulation of people, both in Japan and globally, with people taking the virus to new places, which is another factor behind the virus adapting to new environments,” she further added. With the height of flu season predicted to come earlier than typical, Tsukamoto urged the community to get vaccinated early.&lt;/p&gt;

Immunity has waned and people are getting ill." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are actually more than 100 different viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections, plus some bacterial infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Is there more illness than normal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;Data collection from the UK Health Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (UKHSA) shows Rhinovirus – what many of us would call the common cold – has been on the increase in recent weeks and seems to be the most common cause of illness at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Covid is also doing the rounds, driven by two new variants – XFG, called Stratus by some, and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. But there is already a high degree of immunity built up in the population meaning, for most, it's a fairly mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are signs flu may be on the rise too – there has been an increase in the 15-25 age group over the past week - while RSV, which can cause serious illness in young children, also tends to take off in the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"There is often, although not always, a pattern," says Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"You tend to see Rhinovirus take off first and then RSV," he explains. "Flu tends to come later in December and January. But that's not always the case – and certainly the pandemic disrupted the traditional seasonal trends. What we've seen in the last year or so is those trends return to something like normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He says the levels of illnesses at the moment are not particularly high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Covid is above baseline and there's a lot of Rhinovirus around. The uptick in flu in that younger age group has perhaps come a little bit earlier than we would expect, but it is still at a low level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Is it a cold, flu or Covid?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The most common symptoms, according to the NHS, are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="colds" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Colds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Symptoms appear gradually&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Mostly affect nose and throat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Early sign - pressure in your ears&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Chestier, mucus cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="flu" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Flu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Comes on suddenly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Feel wiped out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Fever, muscle aches, exhaustion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Need bed rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Dry cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="covid" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Covid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Typical flu symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Loss of taste of smell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Diarrhoea or tummy upset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Many of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;How can you protect yourself?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Respiratory infections can, of course, be really dangerous for vulnerable people - in a bad winter tens of thousands of people can die of flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But there is nothing to suggest the respiratory viruses circulating now are causing more serious illness this year in otherwise healthy people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We all react in different ways – and we don't really understand why," admits Prof Ball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Of course, age and fitness have a lot to do with it, but sometimes it is just your individual genetics or how tired and rundown you may be, or when you were last exposed to that particular virus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In terms of protecting yourself, the most important step to take, if you are eligible, is to get vaccinatinated. Shots are being offered for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/vaccination-and-booking-services/get-a-free-rsv-vaccination/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;flu, Covid and RSV&lt;/a&gt; to protect those who are most at-risk of serious illness, which includes older people and those with certain health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;If you are ill, UKHSA says you can help protect others by washing your hands regularly, especially after coughing or sneezing, staying at home if you can and consider wearing a mask if you do have to go into public places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Ball says it is right to take precautions to try to protect vulnerable people, but adds if you are healthy and young or of working age, getting the odd respiratory illness is pretty inevitable and not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Most people will get one or two respiratory infections every year. In some ways, it's a good thing when you are a child or healthy adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"By getting exposed you are building up your immunity through natural infection - so when you are older you hopefully have enough immunity to not get severely ill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 23:07:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1SMWdvdzItbTc5T2lXdml6VERIN25XUHR2YU92NGxNVExPSmg0cEVnMDFRcWYzOVFTYnFPQWwxaWFxUEFvM3VoS0FJOXhwTW5nNHV2eFZFRDZuQdIBX0FVX3lxTE1uTkUtSEVldXB3NTJ0WVR1MVJ4Vml2RW1HNDNUWDl4aXBYZ1NMN24zLTVEWXNfX1NEZzNaODNEQjlVQzFIcmhqWFotUVRMZDU4WDlqclZxaWRiWW5KQ0l3</guid></item><item><title>由哈佛大学训练有素的医生推荐的5种抗衰老补充剂-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/5-anti-aging-supplements-recommended-by-a-harvard-trained-doctor/photostory/124472716.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PectaSol is a pure citrus pectin for increased absorption.

Signals from rods are relayed by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775947/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rod bipolar cells&lt;/a&gt; to downstream neurons, while cones use multiple &lt;a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/cellguide/CL:0000752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cone bipolar cell&lt;/a&gt; types to carry daytime signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new work, the rod pathway’s relay neurons began taking input from cones once many rods were lost. That is a rerouting of signals inside a circuit that is normally kept separate in healthy eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that the retina adapts to the loss of rods in ways that attempt to preserve daytime light sensitivity in the retina,” said A. P. Sampath, Ph.D..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-experimenting-on-the-retina"&gt;Experimenting on the retina&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used rhodopsin knockout mice, a model in which rod photoreceptors first stop responding to light and then gradually die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers recorded electrical signals from single rod bipolar cells in retinal slices to test whether those cells were now driven by cone inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also measured whole retina signals using an &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11554/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;electroretinogram&lt;/a&gt;, a test that sums activity from many cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2023.1153934/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;photopic b-wave&lt;/a&gt; rose in a way consistent with stronger cone driven bipolar cell responses, that evaluates how bipolar cells and Müller glia contribute to this signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the usual connections between rod bipolar cells and rods are lost, these cells can rewire themselves to receive signals from cones instead,” said Sampath. The authors then looked for what event triggers that switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-degeneration-flips-the-switch"&gt;Why degeneration flips the switch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To separate causes, the group tested mice that lacked rod light responses but did not undergo rod death, and mice that lacked the normal rod to rod bipolar synapse. In those models, rod bipolar cells did not show strong cone driven responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26402607/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; shows that the synapse between rods and rod bipolar cells requires &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/392617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ELFN1&lt;/a&gt;, a cell adhesion molecule that helps create the primary rod pathway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This background makes it notable that when rods disappear, the relay neurons appear to reach for new cone inputs rather than stay idle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterns across the data suggest that degeneration itself signals circuits to reconfigure. The switch did not follow from silent rods alone, and it did not follow from a broken rod synapse in the absence of actual cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-second-thread-from-2023"&gt;Second thread from 2023&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another line of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36977418/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; reported that even after severe structural changes, cones and their pathways can still function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work showed degenerating cones retain the key ion channels needed to respond to light and keep useful output to later retinal stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine that result with the new rerouting and a picture emerges. Cones can still respond, and the inner retina can shift to listen to them, which helps explain why many people retain usable daytime &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/clean-air-may-hold-the-key-to-sharper-vision-in-children/"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; well into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the studies point to stepwise adaptation. As rods fail, cone signals carry more of the load, and downstream neurons adjust their wiring to keep those signals moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-could-mean-for-patients"&gt;What it could mean for patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/retinitis-pigmentosa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is rare but not trivial in scale, and families often navigate decades of uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding that circuits can sustain daylight vision by reconfiguring suggests a practical window for treatments that boost or stabilize cone function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a window could matter for gene therapy, optogenetic strategies, or small molecules that increase cone sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If inner retina neurons are already poised to pass on cone signals, preserving the remaining cone responses may translate into more real world sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical tests already capture the mass signals that reflect bipolar cell activity. Tracking the b-wave under bright light could help scientists see whether a medicine or genetic therapy strengthens the rerouted pathway over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-next-steps"&gt;Limits and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results come from mice, and that matters. Human retinas share core circuitry but differ in ratios of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-eyes-retina-sync-everything-they-see-before-sending-visual-signals-to-the-brain/"&gt;rods and cones&lt;/a&gt; and in the way daytime signals are pooled, so translation will require careful testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team plans to examine other mutations that cause rod loss to see if the same circuit shift appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the pattern holds, it would support the idea that degeneration triggers a broader program of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3021747/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;homeostatic plasticity&lt;/a&gt; in the retina that favors preserving daylight function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next challenge is to identify the signals that tell rod bipolar cells to change partners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clues point to &lt;a href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/brain/brain-physiology/what-are-glia"&gt;glia&lt;/a&gt; and to factors released by dying cells, and those ideas can now be tested with interventions and noninvasive readouts in living tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982225006736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 21:15:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPVmV5Z19oaVJpNkxHYkhCbzFoZ0s0SFVtWmlob1YxTGw1MzU2ZnZsT2tTaktwbUdtV09VeDJoUk9VTGFmdXdLZnVCWkMyeVlHckw3eTZHMXdsTjYxcWl5SkFaVzdDbUwtdE94d0FNd29ielZtNlJSblRzNk5RZ0xDZmZtWFo2b2J4blVRMl8xY1NDekdzUFVyNUNwR0huQzR4WXJlZ00tNXczdE5Y</guid></item><item><title>专家透露，阿尔茨海默氏症实际上可能不是脑部疾病- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-reveals-expert</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of a cure for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="177204" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is becoming an increasingly competitive and contentious quest, with recent years witnessing several important controversies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt; reported that a key &lt;a href="https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature04533"&gt;2006 research paper, published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which identified a subtype of brain protein called beta-amyloid as the cause of Alzheimer's, may have been based on fabricated data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year earlier, in June 2021, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/aducanumab-marketed-aduhelm-information"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration had approved aducanumab&lt;/a&gt;, an antibody-targeting beta-amyloid, as a treatment for Alzheimer's, even though the data supporting its use were incomplete and contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some physicians believe aducanumab never should have been approved, while others maintain it should be given a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/learning-one-word-could-help-prevent-a-third-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;Learning One Word Could Help Prevent a Third of Alzheimer's Cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With millions of people needing an effective treatment, why are researchers still fumbling in this quest for a cure for what is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg" alt="Clumps of yellow forming among purple neurons" class="size-medium wp-image-142437" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642.jpg 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of beta-amyloid plaques (yellow) amongst neurons.

The need for a new "out-of-the-clump" way of thinking about Alzheimer's is emerging as a top priority in brain science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My laboratory at the Krembil Brain Institute, part of the University Health Network in Toronto, is devising a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/trc2.12283"&gt;new theory of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our past 30 years of research, we no longer think of Alzheimer's as primarily a disease of the brain. Rather, we believe that Alzheimer's is principally &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1567205018666211202141650"&gt;a disorder of the immune system within the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system, found in every organ in the body, is a collection of cells and molecules that work in harmony to help repair injuries and protect from foreign invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="alignnone wp-image-177073 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person trips and falls, the immune system helps to mend the damaged tissues. When someone experiences a viral or bacterial infection, the immune system helps in the fight against these microbial invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact same processes are present in the brain. When there is head trauma, the brain's immune system kicks into gear to help repair. When bacteria are present in the brain, the immune system is there to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144645" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg" alt="Bright green cells with orange spots in between them" class="size-full wp-image-144645" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;White blood cells of the immune system, activated to fight a bacterial infection.

It is supposed to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain trauma occurs or when bacteria are present in the brain, beta-amyloid is a key contributor to the brain's comprehensive immune response. And this is where the problem begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of striking similarities between the fat molecules that make up both the membranes of bacteria and the membranes of brain cells, beta-amyloid cannot tell the difference between invading bacteria and host brain cells, and mistakenly attacks the very brain cells it is supposed to be protecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leads to a chronic, progressive loss of brain cell function, which ultimately culminates in dementia – all because our body's immune system cannot differentiate between bacteria and brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When regarded as a misdirected attack by the brain's immune system on the very organ it is supposed to be defending, Alzheimer's disease emerges as an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which autoantibodies play a crucial role in the development of the disease, and for which steroid-based therapies can be effective. But these therapies will not work against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is a very special and distinctive organ, recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234155/#"&gt;the most complex structure in the Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144646" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg" alt="A senior man and woman looking at a book together" class="size-full wp-image-144646" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind.

For example, some scientists believe that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2022.05.001"&gt;Alzheimer's is a disease of tiny cellular structures called mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; – the energy factories in every brain cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria convert oxygen from the air we breathe and glucose from the food we eat into the energy required for remembering and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some maintain that it is the end-result of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.339476"&gt;particular brain infection&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/prd.12429"&gt;bacteria from the mouth often being suggested as the culprit&lt;/a&gt;. Still others suggest that the disease may arise from an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom12050714"&gt;abnormal handling of metals within the brain&lt;/a&gt;, possibly zinc, copper, or iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying to see &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2021-327370"&gt;new thinking about this age-old disease&lt;/a&gt;. Dementia currently affects more than 50 million people worldwide, with a new diagnosis being made every three seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children or even their spouse of more than 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a public health crisis in need of innovative ideas and fresh directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg" alt="A young person kissing an older lady on the cheek" class="size-full wp-image-144650" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children.
