	&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles continues to spread in West Texas and New Mexico, with more than 250 people infected — many unvaccinated school-age children. &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;Two cases in Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, for which state officials have not provided a location, have also been linked to these outbreaks. Eleven other states have reported isolated measles cases, typically linked to  international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz g-has-leadin"&gt;Measles cases by county in 2025&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class="g-leadin svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;/span&gt; Isolated cases   &lt;span&gt;●&lt;/span&gt; Outbreaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt; &lt;p class="g-source svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Source: State health departments; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Note: Reported measles cases as of March 11.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The Texas outbreak began in late January,  when local health officials reported two cases in Gaines County, a rural agricultural area on the western edge of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The outbreak quickly escalated. Measles has spread into neighboring counties and infected at least &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;223 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; as of Tuesday, including 29 people who have been hospitalized and an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html"&gt;unvaccinated young child who died&lt;/a&gt;, the first such death in the United States in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;New Mexico also &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;declared an outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Lea County, which borders Gaines County. While the cases in New Mexico have not officially been connected to the Texas outbreak, officials have said they are “undoubtedly related.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;p class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz "&gt;Measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt;  &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Reported measles cases for Texas and New Mexico counties as of March 11.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Last week, an unvaccinated resident of Lea County who &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/health/measles-death-new-mexico.html"&gt;tested positive for the virus died&lt;/a&gt;, though officials have not yet confirmed that measles was the cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;In both states, most measles cases have spread among people who are unvaccinated or with unknown vaccine status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;For years, Gaines County has had low childhood vaccination rates, largely because of the area’s large Mennonite community. While there is no religious doctrine that explicitly forbids vaccines, the insular Christian group has historically avoided interacting with the health care system and has a long tradition of using home remedies and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Roughly 82 percent of the kindergarten students in the county had received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination, or M.M.R., last year, which is far below the 95 percent coverage needed to prevent outbreaks in a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Texas public schools require children to have received certain vaccines, including the M.M.R. shot, but parents can apply for an exemption for “reasons of conscience,” including religious beliefs. Last year, Gaines County had one of the highest exemption rates in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Vaccination rates can vary widely by school district. The Loop Independent School District in Gaines County is a small district with one school and the lowest rate of measles vaccination in the affected Texas counties. Only 46 percent of kindergarten students had received their M.M.R. vaccine in the 2023 school year, down from 82 percent in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz g-has-leadin"&gt;Change in measles vaccination rates in affected Texas counties&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class="g-leadin svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;By county, for public school districts and private schools, since 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt; &lt;p class="g-source svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Source: Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Chart shows the change in reported vaccination rates among kindergarten students in public school districts and private schools from 2019–20 to 2023–24. Homeschooled children are not included in this data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;In Lea County, N.M., the M.M.R. vaccination rate for children and teens is relatively high, at about 94 percent. But the rate among adults is much lower: 63 percent have received one shot of M.M.R., and only 55 percent have received both shots, according to local health officials, though they noted that there may be vaccinated adults whose records have not been added to the system. Adults make up more than half of reported cases in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious known infections. In a hypothetical community where nobody had immunity from the virus and each infected person infected 18 others, a small outbreak would quickly grow out of control:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Every vaccinated person would help slow the spread of the virus and limit the outbreak:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;For the outbreak to end quickly, each infected person would need to infect fewer than one other person, on average. In this example, 17 of 18 people would need to be vaccinated — more than 94 percent of the community:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;And while measles symptoms often resolve on their own within a few weeks, the virus can be extremely dangerous in rare cases. It may cause pneumonia, making it difficult for children to get oxygen into their lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The infection can also lead to brain swelling, which can cause lasting damage, including blindness, deafness and intellectual disabilities. For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The virus also causes “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/health/measles-vaccine-immune-system.html"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;,” making the body unable to defend itself against illnesses it has already been exposed to and leaving patients more susceptible to future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Once someone is infected with the virus, doctors have little control over how serious a measles infection becomes — there is no antiviral for measles to stop its spread in the body, only “supportive care” to help manage symptoms. That’s why experts recommend that people get two doses of the M.M.R. vaccine, which are 97 percent effective at preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles was officially declared eliminated — which means the virus is not continually spreading — in 2000, in large part because of aggressive vaccination campaigns. Experts now fear that status may be at risk, as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;childhood vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; have been falling nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

"As this investigation is ongoing, potential other exposures are also being assessed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's first two measles cases this year have been in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was unvaccinated but did not attend daycare or school while infectious, according to the Suffolk County Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials said the child had recently traveled "outside of the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials declined to give the age of the infected child, other than to say they were under 5. Since children generally receive their first measles vaccination between the age of 12 and 15 months, babies are usually unvaccinated for their first year of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, a child under 5 from Nassau County was also treated at Cohen's for measles. It wasn't clear how that child contracted the disease and they had not been traveling overseas, where measles is more common. The child recovered and was released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, the most recent Long Island measles cases were in 2019, when there were three in Nassau and one in Suffolk, according to state health department data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new Suffolk case has not been linked to measles outbreaks elsewhere in the United States, the health department said. The majority of cases have been reported in Texas, where 223 people have tested positive for measles, including one school-aged child who died from the disease. That child had not received a measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen Children’s Medical Center is working with health officials "under established exposure protocols to ensure no further cases arise from this incident," according to a hospital statement emailed to Newsday on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles can be very serious. It’s much more than just a rash as complications can include pneumonia and inflammation of the brain, and often results in hospitalization," New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a statement. "The most important thing people can do to protect themselves is to ensure they've been properly immunized against measles and immediately get a shot if they are not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can live up to 2 hours in the air even after an infected person leaves, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms, such as high fever, cough and red eyes start 7 to 14 days after a person is infected, followed by a distinctive red rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One dose of the measles vaccine, which is given between 12 and 15 months, gives you about 93% protection," said Dr. Matthew Harris, who works in emergency medicine at Cohen Children's Medical Center. "The second dose, which is given between 4 and 6 years, gets it up to about 97%."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris said a very small percentage of children who are fully vaccinated get measles and if they do it is a much more mild form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no treatment for measles, the best we can offer is supportive care," Harris said. "It can cause a devastating pneumonia, it can cause a form of encephalitis that is irreversible and we also know that measles has longstanding impact on your immune system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told NewsdayTV Tuesday: "Measles was nearly eradicated in the early 2000s. The emergence of measles here in New York and in many states around the country is highly concerning because there are many children who are at extraordinarily high risk for complications of measles, namely those under the age of 1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before a measles vaccine became available in 1963, about three to four million Americans were infected with measles every year, 400 to 500 people died and 48,000 were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With David Olson and AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Lisa L.

County Department of Public Health announced Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a viral infection that spreads through the air and via droplets. It can potentially lead to serious health complications, including death. The virus can spread when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, or a person can contract it by touching an infected surface, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines#:~:text=A%20measles%20outbreak%20in%20the,may%20only%20become%20more%20common." target="_blank"&gt;John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is so contagious, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says, you can get measles just by being in a room where an infected person has been — even up to two hours after that person has left the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second recent case of a measles-infected person exposing others at LAX. Last month, an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-28/first-confirmed-measles-case-in-los-angeles-county-since-2015-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;infected infant&lt;/a&gt; returning home to Orange County arrived at the airport on a Korean Air flight in Terminal B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials listed the following locations the infected person visited after their flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are at risk of exposure to the recent measles case include: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Travelers who were at the Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX the evening of March 5 between 7 and 10:40 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who visited Cloud 9 Nail Salon in North Hollywood on March 7 between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. The salon is at 5142 N. Lankershim Blvd.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customers of Superior Grocers at 10683 Valley Blvd. in El Monte who visited on March 10 between 8:15 and 10:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;California now has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx#:~:text=As%20of%20February%2022%2C%202025%2C%20three%E2%80%8B%20confirmed%20measles%20case,provisional%20and%20subject%20to%20change." target="_blank"&gt;five reported cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; as of March 11 amid an expanding measles outbreak in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 222 cases across the nation in states that include Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All measles cases diagnosed in California thus far were of infected people who traveled internationally, the county health department stated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 17% of cases nationwide have required hospitalization for management of measles complications or for the purpose of isolation, and two people have died from complications of the disease; most of the cases have been among individuals who were not immunized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best way to protect against the measles is with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting the first dose of the MMR vaccine at ages 12 to 15 months and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-to-do-if-youve-been-exposed-to-measles" class="subhead"&gt;What to do if you’ve been exposed to measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were on the flight or at the terminal, nail salon or grocery store where the infected traveler visited, you should:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review your immunization and medical records to determine if you’re protected against measles. If you have not had measles in the past or have not yet obtained the measles vaccine, you are at risk of contracting the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact and notify your healthcare provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if you are pregnant, have a weakened immune system or haven’t been immunized against the disease. Parents or guardians of infants who were possibly exposed should contact their pediatrician.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor yourself for symptoms, specifically a fever or unexpected rash from seven to 21 days after the potential exposure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, stay home and do not enter a healthcare facility before calling first to make them aware of your exposure and symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-long-it-takes-for-measles-symptoms-to-appear" class="subhead"&gt;How long it takes for measles symptoms to appear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can develop from seven to 21 days after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposed individuals who have been free of symptoms for more than 21 days are no longer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-symptoms-of-measles" class="subhead"&gt;The symptoms of measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between seven and 14 days after exposure, your symptoms could include high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From seven to 18 days after exposure, you may develop a rash on your face and upper neck. The rash can spread to your hands and feet over the course of three days.

                                        &lt;p&gt;As the U.S. grapples with its first measles deaths in nearly a decade, health officials are urging Southern Californians to verify their vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two unvaccinated people have died of measles in the past two weeks — including a &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;child in rural Texas&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5320352/measles-rfk-west-texas-outbreak" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;adult in a New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; — part of an outbreak that has infected more than 200 people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far,  there have been more than 220 measles cases reported in 12 U.S. states this year, compared with 285 throughout last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, L.A. County officials confirmed a case in a resident who recently had traveled through LAX. Passengers "assigned to specific seats" on China Airlines flight CAL8/CI8 arriving March 5 will be notified that they may have been exposed, according to a news release from Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. Local officials said they're working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, people at the following locations are cautioned of possible exposure:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wednesday, March 5, from 7 p.m. to 10:40 p.m. at Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Friday, March 7, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.: Cloud 9 Nail Salon, 5142 N. Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monday, March 10, from 8:15 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.: Superior Grocery Store, 10683 Valley Blvd., El Monte.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no active outbreak in California, there are now &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;five confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in the state since January, according to the California Department of Public Health. That includes an infected &lt;a class="Link" href="https://laist.com/news/health/health-officials-warn-of-potential-measles-exposure-at-lax" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;infant who traveled through &lt;u&gt;LAX&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Feb. 19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of 2024, there were 15 confirmed measles cases in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has strict student &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/School/laws-california-law.aspx" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vaccination laws&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and an average vaccination rate above 96% among kindergartners, but health officials warn that the region remains vulnerable because of international travel connections and pockets of under-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mem-embed mem-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine provides the best protection against the disease. According to the CDC, 94% of reported cases have been in unvaccinated people or those with unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have questions about measles and your risks in Southern California? We have answers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What’s causing the current spike in U.S. measles cases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary cause is declining vaccination rates, experts say. Outbreaks are most likely to occur when the vaccination rate&lt;a class="Link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html__;!!Iwwt!WOht7WM-b65xhcncf6ZyqjlBqbKTRaIxWB-NlqKDVH0JWldhrMa3FkN8ikXMnavEP7uPA4dFvFvxPawOGro$" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt; in a community dips below 95%&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rural west Texas county where the current outbreak is centered has an 82% MMR vaccination rate among kindergarteners, according to &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;state health records&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason we are seeing measles outbreaks is solely because some parents are not protecting their children from this highly contagious disease by immunizing them,” said John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And in some cases, it’s because adults who have not been vaccinated are choosing to remain unvaccinated," Swartzberg continued. "There is no other explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many communities have fallen below the 95% threshold in recent years, health experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The primary reason for lower vaccination rates has been misinformation spreading through the internet and social media about potential harms of vaccination,” said Saahir Khan, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at USC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent example is a scientific paper from the early 1990s that claimed to find a link between vaccination and autism — the study was later debunked and &lt;a class="Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2831678/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;retracted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As of last week, the CDC is planning a study to revisit that topic, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-plans-study-into-vaccines-autism-sources-say-2025-03-07/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reuters reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How common is measles in the U.S.?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles was &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;officially eliminated from the United States in 2000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which means there is no continuous transmission of the disease originating within the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New cases typically begin when travelers bring measles from abroad. Local outbreaks can occur when the disease reaches communities with pockets of unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, the number of people reported to have measles each year has ranged from a low of 37 people in 2004 to a high of 1,282 in 2019, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s the likelihood of a measles outbreak in Southern California?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An outbreak in the Los Angeles area is much less likely than in rural Texas because Southern California counties have generally maintained vaccination rates above 95% among school-aged children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kern County, which borders L.A. County, had an MMR vaccination rate below 92% during the 2022-23 school year. That year, 12 Northern California counties also had vaccination rates below the threshold for herd immunity, according to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/2022-23KindergartenFirstGradeSummaryReport.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;California Department of Public Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if there are pockets of people who have not been vaccinated within Southern California, an outbreak could occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are likely specific communities within Los Angeles that have lower vaccination rates and are at risk of outbreaks, as we have observed in other areas as with the Somali community in Minnesota or the Orthodox Jewish community in New York,” Khan said. “Unfortunately, vaccine misinformation has been targeted at these communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community-level data on vaccination rates are available through annual school reporting audits conducted by the California Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data provided for the 2021-22 academic year shows more than 200 schools in Los Angeles County with less than 95% of students vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check out recent MMR vaccination rates at your child’s school or childcare facility (or schools in your ZIP code) in an &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/School/HowDoing.aspx" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;interactive map and database&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained by state health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Has Southern California had a measles outbreak before?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Southern California has experienced several measles outbreaks in recent years. The most significant was a 2014-15 outbreak associated with Disneyland, which infected at least 131 California residents and spread to other states and countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, there were 73 confirmed measles cases in California, including 41 cases associated with six outbreaks. Five of those outbreaks were linked to patients who traveled internationally, according to state health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I safe if I was vaccinated as a kid?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you received two doses of the measles vaccine as a child, you are considered protected for life and do not need a booster dose, according to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re exposed to the virus, two doses of measles vaccine are about 97% effective, according to the CDC. One dose is about 93% effective. In the rare cases when vaccinated people do contract measles, they typically experience milder symptoms and are less contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you received only one dose as a child and were born after 1957, you are generally considered protected. But the CDC recommends that people in some groups ensure they’ve had two doses, including college students, healthcare workers and international travelers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you received the killed measles vaccine (an earlier formulation used between 1963-1967), you should ask your doctor about getting revaccinated with the current MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are immunocompromised or pregnant should not get vaccinated, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone is unsure, has not been vaccinated, or does not think they completed the full series and may be at higher risk they should talk with their doctor about getting a booster dose,” said Scott Roberts, assistant professor of Infectious Diseases at Yale School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I safe if I've had the measles before?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. The CDC considers you protected from measles if you have medical records confirming you had measles at some point in your life. Natural immunity after measles infection is lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People born before 1957 are generally considered to have lifelong natural immunity because of widespread exposure to measles prior to the introduction of the vaccination program in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What if I don't have my vaccination records?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can’t find your vaccination records or other proof of measles immunity, the CDC recommends getting the MMR vaccine. There is no harm in getting another dose if you may already be immune, according to the health agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could have a healthcare provider test your blood to determine whether you’re immune, but this is generally not recommended, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The antibody test is less helpful since it waxes and wanes, is variable by lab, and doesn’t measure all arms of the immune system,” said Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should my baby get an early 'bonus dose'?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early doses of the MMR vaccine (before 12 months) are typically only recommended for infants traveling to countries with high measles rates or living in areas with active measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no active outbreak in Southern California currently, experts recommend sticking with the regular vaccination timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early "bonus doses" don't count toward the two-dose series needed for school entry, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Children who receive an early dose still need their regular doses at 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vaccine works best if you get it for the first time between 12 and 15 months,” said Swartzberg. “If you get it earlier than 12 months, you’ll need to get two more doses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerned parents should talk to their child’s pediatrician, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How contagious is measles? How serious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is extremely contagious. The virus is airborne and can live in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours. Each infected person can spread the disease to as many as 18 others who are not protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the vaccination program began in 1963, 3 million to 4 million people got measles each year in the United States, according to CDC estimates. Those cases resulted in 48,000 hospitalizations and between 400 and 500 deaths annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, for every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it, according to the CDC. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms typically develop one to two weeks after exposure and occur in several stages:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initial symptoms: High fever, cough, runny nose and conjunctivitis (red, watery eyes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two to three days later: Small white spots may appear inside the mouth. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;After three to 5 days: A rash breaks out, beginning on the face and spreading to the neck, torso, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What should I do if I think I've been exposed to measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe you've been exposed, federal health officials recommend the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call your doctor ASAP — don’t go straight to a medical facility without calling because you could put others at risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check your immunity status (vaccination history, past infection).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home and avoid public places for three weeks if you're unvaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor for symptoms even if you're vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, isolate yourself and call your doctor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mem-embed mem-end"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

Researchers found that compromised sleep quality leads to dysfunction in this crucial system, potentially increasing risks for memory decline and cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced brain imaging in 72 older adults, the research highlighted that poor sleep negatively impacts connections within brain networks linked to memory performance. These insights emphasize the importance of maintaining good sleep hygiene to support brain health and healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep and Brain Health:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor sleep quality impairs the brain’s glymphatic system, crucial for clearing harmful proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Dysfunctional glymphatic activity due to poor sleep correlates with memory decline in older adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep quality directly influences brain networks, affecting overall cognitive health and aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Hong Kong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor sleep among older adults is linked to disruptions in the brain’s “waste removal system”, according to researchers at The University of Hong Kong (HKU).  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study led by Professor Tatia M.C. Lee, Chair Professor of Psychological Science and Clinical Psychology and May Professor in Neuropsychology at HKU, offers valuable insight into how sleep quality impacts brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies have linked poor sleep with a decline in brain functioning. Professor Lee’s team focused on the glial-lymphatic (glymphatic) system, a fluid transport pathway that plays a vital role in clearing waste from the brain. The system’s efficiency is a critical determinant of brain health, particularly in ageing populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Lee and her team sought to understand the glymphatic-brain relationship in poor sleepers, which underlies memory decline. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system leads to the accumulation of toxic proteins, and this process has recently been implicated in several neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep quality, brain activities, and glyphamtic functioning are related. Understanding how sleep quality influences the glymphatic system and human brain networks offers valuable insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning age-related memory change,” Professor Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team studied 72 older adults using functional MRI scans and sleep recordings.  The findings indicate that poor sleep quality adversely affects normal brain function by deactivating the restorative glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results clearly reveal the effect of sleep on the human brain’s network through the glymphatic system, which in turn affects memory performance in older adults,” said Professor Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Therefore, maintaining efficient glymphatic functioning seems crucial for promoting healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study add important evidence that sleep quality affects cognitive health through the underlying neural relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Impaired memory is a common complaint among older adults with poor sleep quality,” Professor Lee noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results provide a novel perspective on the interplay between sleep, the glymphatic system and multimodal brain networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was recently published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; in an article entitled “Effects of sleep on the glymphatic functioning and multimodal human brain network affecting memory in older adults”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and sleep research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e6efe2e9f1e5ededc8e0e3fda6e0e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jaymee Ng&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hku.hk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jaymee Ng – University of Hong Kong&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02778-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of sleep on the glymphatic functioning and multimodal human brain network affecting memory in older adults&lt;/a&gt;” by Tatia M.C.

A proxy of the glymphatic functioning was obtained from the Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural and functional brain networks were constructed based on MRI data, and coupling between the two networks (SC-FC coupling) was also calculated. Correlation analyses revealed that DTI-ALPS was negatively correlated with sleep quality measures [e.g., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and apnea-hypopnea index].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding human brain networks, DTI-ALPS was associated with the strength of both functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) involving regions such as the middle temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, as well as with the SC-FC coupling of rich-club connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we found that DTI-ALPS positively mediated the association between sleep quality and rich-club SC-FC coupling. The rich-club SC-FC coupling further mediated the association between DTI-ALPS and memory function in good sleepers but not in poor sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest a disrupted glymphatic-brain relationship in poor sleepers, which underlies memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings add important evidence that sleep quality affects cognitive health through the underlying neural relationships and the interplay between the glymphatic system and multimodal brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 21:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5IN2JHNjd6dzlDRTV1V0RQVWZWUkVGUldGdTdTenVFRE5nUWJjRm92OWZVZ1FCMlRtMEJVeUotS1NNNEhMSXBpTVBfUUY0Q3BuOXkwM3Z3RjBocmZzam1tNHV2VHE4R1ZoN3A3SXlYbFlqVnM</guid></item><item><title>Man Whose Daughter Died From Measles Stands by Failure to Vaccinate Her: "The Vaccination Has Stuff We Don’t Trust" - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5aQmdLZ2M2dXNEUE4xeVlubWwzRnpjNmMxVWZhaHJuVHJMdmFzV193RDN1Qm5DdmdiNmp6XzZDUXlsNmlDTUdPdkJsNHg1c0ZMWWhjbHlTLVNJZVE5LVJiT3J0bXJwY3hEcjBwNDZxTXduQjZZZkQteQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus far, there's only been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;one confirmed death&lt;/a&gt; in the measles outbreak spreading across North America — and the father of the unvaccinated child who died of the preventable disease is expressing no regrets about failing to get her the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a startling &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the father of the six-year-old girl who became the first measles death in the United States &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/texas-measles-death/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;in 10 years&lt;/a&gt; discussed the beliefs that led up to her dying from an infectious disease that was essentially &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;eradicated at the turn of the last century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identified only as Peter, the father at the heart of this tragedy is, like many others in Seminole, the small West Texas town at the center of the outbreak, a member of the traditional-minded Christian sect known as Mennonites. There's apparently nothing in that group's doctrine barring modern medicine, but like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8858841/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;many other conservative religious groups&lt;/a&gt;, many Mennonites are vaccine skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vaccination has stuff we don’t trust," Peter told &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. "We don’t like the vaccinations, what they have these days. We heard too much, and we saw too much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter insists that measles is a normal part of life — although for much of the country, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/well/measles-outbreaks-texas-rfk-jr.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;it is not&lt;/a&gt;, and hasn't been for decades in the wake of generations of successful vaccination campaigns against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody has it," the man told the magazine. "It’s not so new for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those comments echo claims made by new Health and Human Services secretary Robert F.

More than 250  people have been infected and 29 have been hospitalized in the most recent outbreak that has spread from Texas to New Mexico and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oklahoma/index.html" id="mol-ef942a30-fec2-11ef-bd5e-dd3e735ad835"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 28-year-old Mennonite man named Peter in Seminole, Texas, revealed his six-year-old daughter was America's first measles death in a decade.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing his daughter was the first fatality to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;, Peter said he belongs to a Mennonite community in Seminole, Texas, where many of its residents are unvaccinated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing his daughter's illness, he said she had been sick for three weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family knew it was measles and took her to the hospital at one point, but doctors gave her cough medicine and told the family to 'go home.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They don't want to help us,' Peter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as the girl's condition deteriorated, the family brought her back to doctors who put her on a ventilator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peter explained: 'She just kept getting sicker and sicker. Her lungs plugged up. We were there Saturday ’til Monday, three days … and then it was worse, very bad.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That Tuesday, the girl died of pneumonia, which is common in severe measles cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most Texas cases, 156 in total, have been in Gaines county, where Seminole is located. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccination rate in the area is 82 percent, well below the 95 percent needed to maintain herd immunity. The national average was 93 percent last school year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows Seminole, in the west of Texas, where the outbreak was first reported. Seminole is located in Gaines county, which has reported the majority of cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Texas officials have set up a mobile unit to offer tests and vaccinations for measles to parents and children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many in Mennonite communities like Peter's are unvaccinated, though those figures are not reflected in official data, as the children are often homeschooled or enrolled in nonaccredited schools that don't have to collect data.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The religious doctrine does not forbid vaccines, though many residents, including Peter, have doubts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said measles is considered normal for the community and 'everybody has it. It's not so new for us.' He had also heard getting measles could strengthen the immune system against other diseases, a theory Robert F Kennedy Jr has promoted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peter also worries about the vaccine's potential effects on his children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The vaccination has stuff we don’t trust. We don’t like the vaccinations, what they have these days,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We heard too much, and we saw too much'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peter also insisted the Mennonite community, where most of the Texas cases are centered, has been unjustly singled out and that it's not just Mennonites spreading the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peter said his daughter's death was 'very hard' and that it left 'a big hole' in his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before telling reporters he had nothing else to say, he added: 'You probably know how it goes when somebody passes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's really hard to believe.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 21:25:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPSHlpZXhXcXhOc3RYRDRyS0ZwTzJQSjE3R3F6OGhodkw2X1FJWEYySTJ2bUxta2s0bXh4eFY1TWxoMTljUkJsUXhVTG93akhPa01LbFRKWFVpTWIwTURqWjA2dTBfYWUySDRSWWZGQnZUSW4tb2FRR3ZEX1E5c20wOFhla05wRkxhbjc5MVFZOVlRMzY4ZmJv0gGcAUFVX3lxTE9JdDAtTktLM0pMaXM0UUFvUzVzNUhsQk45OGRsU2o0T3c3dDhlZU1ZUUxQOE5hNDc1bmxvUUVjbEd0ZGk5VXQxSnlQRE9kTHVYbDB0c0Mwck9QT2tJbnJKc2pkZG5aeF8xVnlvcnIxYkhqd2VSLWFkYjhXbENLeTBvampCTUkzXzVUYkptTmZ0RFZnZTd2TmV1US01cA</guid></item><item><title>Vermont confirms first case of measles of year in school-aged child - The Guardian US</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTFBKM0ZKdWpYVmxsZy1GdUUzMlRNVkFGSmZxVTlnaE0wQ19TeXZiMlh4SHpjRi1UUkRPZndGaUVRemxUMnhSMVZzc3g3bWFKUF9acXNMUlpudmtKbEd3d3hnWnhTZ2tFZ1pUWF9tOVpFeGlDOWJjaExQZ0IteVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The first case of measles in Vermont in 2025 has been confirmed in a school-aged child in Lamoille county, the &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/media/current-news-releases/vermont-department-health-confirms-case-measles#:~:text=WATERBURY%2C%20VT%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Vermont%20Department,traveling%20internationally%20in%20recent%20days" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Vermontdepartment of health&lt;/a&gt; reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The child became sick in recent days after returning with their family from traveling internationally and has been isolated from most community settings while they have been contagious, according to the department.

Image via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vermont Department of Health has confirmed a case of measles in a school-aged child in Lamoille County — the first to be discovered in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unnamed child became sick after travelling internationally with family. The risk to the public is believed to be “low,” but Vermonters who may have been exposed to the child at the Copley Hospital emergency department may need to take action to protect others, according to a Tuesday press release from the department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child tested positive Monday after visiting Copley Hospital in Morrisville the day prior. Anyone who was inside the hospital’s emergency department between 3:15 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Sunday should confirm their immunity to measles through vaccination or previous infection, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/signs-symptoms.html"&gt;monitor for symptoms&lt;/a&gt; through March 30, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cannot confirm your immunity by contacting your health care provider or &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/stats/registries/immunization-registry#requests"&gt;requesting your immunization records&lt;/a&gt;, you should call the health department at 802-863-7240, option 2 for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this is the first case of measles reported in the state in 2025, there were &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2024/04/23/vermont-confirms-first-measles-case-since-2018/"&gt;two documented cases in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, one in 2018 and another in 2011, according to the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This most recent case has not been linked to ongoing outbreaks in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html"&gt;southern United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/measles/measles-outbreak"&gt;Québec&lt;/a&gt;, according to the department. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html"&gt;more than 200 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; so far this year, up from just 58 in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health department officials urged Vermonters to get themselves and their children vaccinated for measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials attribute the recent uptick in measles, in part, “to an increase in the number of unvaccinated people, which impacts community immunity,” the department said in the release. About &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/stats/surveillance-reporting-topic/school-vaccination-data"&gt;93% of school-aged children&lt;/a&gt; in Vermont are vaccinated for measles — below the 95% benchmark that experts believe is essential for herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;most contagious diseases worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and can be deadly, especially in children under 5. One in five unvaccinated people with measles end up hospitalized for the disease, according to the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a high fever, a cough, and a rash a few days after initial symptoms appear.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vyaem001s3b73l6a9b0lw@published"&gt;My partner of 10 years tested positive for HIV two years into our relationship. I’ve continued to test negative, but we haven’t been intimate for over two years now (we had some problems that included a separation; I was the one that initiated our getting back together). It was good, at first.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="209" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84xlnso002y3b73tdkrjr3f@published"&gt;But some of the issues that caused our breakup have resurfaced; without getting too deep, it’s largely his temper, an inability to admit faults, and what I perceive as a lack of respect for me. Frankly, I feel disinclined to take the risks involved with sex, regardless of how small they might be (as a child of the ‘80s/’90s, getting over my phobic level fear hasn’t been easy) for someone who hasn’t been treating me well. It’s also difficult to trust his claims that he never forgets his medication and has remained undetectable when I’m catching him in lies about other things. I’m also aware that a part of me is allowing him to get away with more than I should, or normally would, and maybe even staying with him out of a feeling of guilt or horror at the thought of him facing this alone. I don’t know what to do. Either way I look at it, this is impacting every aspect of my relationship. I don’t want fear to guide me but I also don’t want to stay with someone who’s not treating me right, simply because I feel obligated. I don’t even know what I want to do, or if I can trust my own feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vyajw001v3b73n86csdtp@published"&gt;Let’s take your partner’s HIV status out of the equation for a moment. You’re looking at a person who has a concerning temper, refuses to admit faults (and, therefore, probably refuses to work on them), and shows a lack of respect for you. You also don’t trust them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vyaln001w3b73swbdt9u3@published"&gt;Leave. It doesn’t matter how much you love a person, how badly you feel about their situation, or how much you want to support them. You need to protect yourself first, and being in a relationship with someone who has a temper, who disrespects you, and who you don’t trust is simply dangerous. Despite the messages we receive from our cultures, love does not actually mean we have to behave in any certain way. We can love someone and never see them again because that’s what’s best for one or both of us. We can love someone and limit our interactions with them. Love does not obligate us to tolerate unacceptable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vyaoh001x3b734mqaymd8@published"&gt;As far as the HIV layer of your situation, you’re correct that a person with undetectable status (and, therefore, what the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2018/july/undetectable-untransmittable"&gt;calls a clear inability to transmit the virus&lt;/a&gt; sexually) only remains that way if they’re taking their medication properly, which means taking the pills consistently and also keeping up with medical appointments and listening to their doctor’s advice. As much as the vestiges of ‘80s and ‘90s-era uncertainty, fear, and shaming are present in your reaction, your inability to trust your partner points to a very real risk. Sure, you could make sure condoms are also in the equation. But the line in your letter about being less inclined to take risks for someone who hasn’t been treating you well speaks to my earlier point.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vyavf001y3b736wfe8vgo@published"&gt;You do have a lot of feelings to work through—anyone would after a 10-year relationship—and a therapist would likely be a great support as you do so. If that kind of treatment isn’t an option, you might consider journaling, talking with trusted friends who are good with listening and empathy, or anything else that’s served you well while processing emotions over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm84vvoka003pejm4035dhcto@published"&gt;For most of our five-year relationship, my partner has considered not shaving her pubes. Besides finding it generally tedious, she has a common, non-STI-related skin condition that periodically flares up on different parts of her body (including her genital area), which shaving exacerbates. She continued shaving for most of our relationship due to struggles with her body image. After a recent flare-up, and me continuously reiterating my genuine support, she finally decided to stop shaving and grow out her pubes. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/08/girlfriend-bush-pubic-hair-sex-advice.html"&gt;However, I recently ate her out post-flareup, with a fully grown bush…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Conditions like narcissistic personality disorder, anorexia, and body dysmorphic disorder thrive on social platforms, allowing users to build and maintain distorted self-perceptions without real-world checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights how virtual environments enable users to escape social scrutiny, intensifying delusional self-images and potentially exacerbating existing mental health issues. Researchers emphasize that social media isn’t inherently harmful, but immersive virtual environments coupled with real-life isolation can significantly amplify unhealthy mental states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delusional Disorders:&lt;/strong&gt; High social media use strongly correlates with disorders such as narcissistic personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, erotomania, and anorexia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Presentation Issue:&lt;/strong&gt; Social media allows users to maintain unrealistic and self-enhancing identities without reality-based scrutiny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible Solutions:&lt;/strong&gt; Emerging immersive technologies like eye-contact interfaces, 3D interactions, and avatars may help mitigate harmful psychological effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Simon Fraser University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from Simon Fraser University researchers has found a close link between high levels of social media use and psychiatric disorders that involve delusions, such as narcissism and body dysmorphic disorder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the recently published study in &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; – a systematic review of all available academic literature including scrutiny of over 2,500 publications on social media use and psychiatric disorders – forms of delusions were by far the most prevalent type of psychiatric disorders related to high social media use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108110"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person and a phone." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/delusion-disorder-social-media-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They also point out that the features of many popular apps and platforms sustain and exacerbate mental and physical delusions, by enabling self-presentation in self-promoting but inaccurate ways. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These disorders include narcissistic personality disorder (delusions of superiority), erotomania (delusions that someone famous loves you), body dysmorphic disorder (delusions of flaws in some part of one’s body) and anorexia (delusions about body size).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Social media is creating conditions where delusions can more easily be generated and sustained due to the presence of platforms and apps that cater to the disorder’s causes, plus the absence of effective reality-checking,” says Bernard Crespi, a professor of biological sciences and Canada Research Chair in Evolutionary Genetics and Psychology at SFU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research has important implications for the causes and symptoms of mental illnesses, and how they can be exacerbated by online social platforms.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the authors, social media itself isn’t inherently problematic, but the virtual worlds – coupled with social isolation in “real life” – create environments where people can maintain a delusional sense of self identity without scrutiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While social media can have positive benefits through its ability to create communities and help people feel more togetherness, Crespi and his co-author Nancy Yang argue that higher-risk individuals are often negatively impacted by high social media use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They also point out that the features of many popular apps and platforms sustain and exacerbate mental and physical delusions, by enabling self-presentation in self-promoting but inaccurate ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The profound difference between online and in-person social interactions – where people are more likely to have their delusions kept in check by physical and emotional reality – exacerbate deviations from mental well-being, he adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study concludes that people with disorders involving high levels of delusionality would benefit from reducing their social media use. It also calls for more research to be done on the specific features of social media that encourage delusions and look for ways to make online social interactions more grounded and real life-like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To achieve this, the researchers cite the potential of eye-contact technology, 3D perspectives, avatars and other immersive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology and delusional disorder research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e984889d9db682808c859d908288a99a8f9cc78a88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matt Kieltyka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfu.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Simon Fraser University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matt Kieltyka – Simon Fraser University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-025-06528-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;I tweet, therefore I am: a systematic review on social media use and disorders of the social brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Bernard Crespi et al. &lt;em&gt;BMC Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tweet, therefore I am: a systematic review on social media use and disorders of the social brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With rapid technological advances, social media has become an everyday form of human social interactions. For the first time in evolutionary history, people can now interact in virtual spaces where temporal, spatial, and embodied cues are decoupled from one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What implications do these recent changes have for socio-cognitive phenotypes and mental disorders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have conducted a systematic review on the relationships between social media use and mental disorders involving the social brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main findings indicate evidence of increased social media usage in individuals with psychotic spectrum phenotypes and especially among individuals with disorders characterized by alterations in the basic self, most notably narcissism, body dysmorphism, and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings can be understood in the context of a new conceptual model, referred to here as ‘Delusion Amplification by Social Media’, whereby this suite of disorders and symptoms centrally involves forms of mentalistic delusions, linked with altered perception and perpetuation of distorted manifestations of the self, that are enabled and exacerbated by social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, an underdeveloped and incoherent sense of self, in conjunction with ‘real life’ social isolation that inhibits identify formation and facilitates virtual social interactions, may lead to use of social media to generate and maintain a more or less delusional sense of self identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delusions involved may be mental (as in narcissism and erotomania), or somatic (as in body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorders, encompassing either the entire body or specific body parts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, the virtual nature of social media facilitates the delusionality because the self is defined and bolstered in this highly mentalistic environment, where real-life exposure of the delusion can be largely avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current evidence also suggests that increased social media usage, via its disembodied and isolative nature, may be associated with psychotic spectrum phenotypes, especially delusionality, by the decoupling of inter and intra-corporeal cues integral to shared reality testing, leading to the blurring of self-other boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:49:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1acXRrNFR5WkRJWmlsQTExaEM0elc2bUotVHprRFAyWVlDdnNka01qNkctUnVDTE1hTlk2Zk15Z0tUVndQNDh0VEhiaXlLWjhoQS00SVEta1oxb1NRZ1h6NUtmeEZLSkJreXZkc1pCdDBTcmhlbzY1bA</guid></item><item><title>NYSDOH: Suffolk County child tests positive for measles - News 12 Long Island</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxOWEg3UVZMTG9JUFFVUmlaLVNHYUJGQUd3WHdsaHRjRHRtMno3SVVWN1ROWDhrdHhGTzlVZ3hhZFQ4cEdudmZRZjI0X1VkYzctaWxNX0lxNEZiYWRRb0c0MlczSXEySDdUT0xYN25Eb2toYzZnOFl5ZWlBMmlIUW1kanJXdy1PdEdTUEh6Mg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div alignitems="normal" justifycontent="normal" direction="column" gap="1rem,1.25rem" flexwrap="nowrap" class="sc-fsYfdN hQgjIe sc-1348a9b4-0 lhdfiP"&gt;&lt;p class="block"&gt;A Suffolk County child tested positive for measles, according to the New York State Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;This marks the first case of measles in New York outside of New York City in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The NYSDOH says there was potential exposure to measles for those who visited the pediatric emergency department at Cohen Children's Medical Center on March 3 to March 4 or visited an inpatient child on the Medicine 3 unit from March 3 to March 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The patient, who is under the age of 5, is being treated at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Queens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 Long Island</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:27:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOWEg3UVZMTG9JUFFVUmlaLVNHYUJGQUd3WHdsaHRjRHRtMno3SVVWN1ROWDhrdHhGTzlVZ3hhZFQ4cEdudmZRZjI0X1VkYzctaWxNX0lxNEZiYWRRb0c0MlczSXEySDdUT0xYN25Eb2toYzZnOFl5ZWlBMmlIUW1kanJXdy1PdEdTUEh6Mg</guid></item><item><title>Young Americans are getting happier - The Economist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOWVM0NGNNVHFQUlZCNmhrUzNtWm5Wc2JfMkJMVFpjNC1vOHBwR0xXMU9IYmhYN2pkWVBRT0l0QnRhYXIxN1VUOEc1VlBHZ295NllTVDl6NERfV0NnVXpNSlphb1NnY2ZVdTRkOEpQY3RIOElCOXZFVGRqWnpIS2lCSmtfMnM1Y1dlMmt0UlJtaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-1r8p72t efq1yh21"&gt;&lt;p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0"&gt;&lt;span data-caps="initial"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;MERICAn youth &lt;/small&gt;are in the midst of a mental-illness epidemic. Few know this better than Daniel Eisenberg. In 2007 the &lt;small&gt;UCLA&lt;/small&gt; health-policy professor, then at the University of Michigan, sent a mental-health survey to 5,591 college students and found that 22% showed signs of depression. Over the next 15 years as new students were polled this figure grew. In 2022, when more than 95,000 students at 373 universities were surveyed, a staggering 44% displayed symptoms of depression. Then, curiously, the trend reversed. In 2023 41% of students seemed depressed; in 2024, the figure fell again to 38%. Mr Eisenberg is cautiously optimistic. “It’s the first time that things are moving in a positive direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economist</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 19:48:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOWVM0NGNNVHFQUlZCNmhrUzNtWm5Wc2JfMkJMVFpjNC1vOHBwR0xXMU9IYmhYN2pkWVBRT0l0QnRhYXIxN1VUOEc1VlBHZ295NllTVDl6NERfV0NnVXpNSlphb1NnY2ZVdTRkOEpQY3RIOElCOXZFVGRqWnpIS2lCSmtfMnM1Y1dlMmt0UlJtaw</guid></item><item><title>Measles case confirmed in Vermont - WCAX</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBfbnJnRE1uc3I0ZkZZMzUyQl9zQjBoT3Joek81UmRmYmpXckJUejJtcXdlV05Mam56a2o5QUVGNDdiUEt4bERMU2VrTUtZaFpHcGExSE9YWGdSS3MwT2tfZ1o3UGZ3eG01SFpaUFRXNlLSAYQBQVVfeXFMT0xDcEgtWmdxZ1QxS0RFMVVEc0tWQkVoSnFlZ1VqTEh0TUs4S2ttRE5PSFoycldFcHJraU9IbDJ3UVRZMjc0b0MwY0Y0aWtkMVFrNy1BUzhDMVlkQ3JJUG1OM0w3ZDg5QmZnNVFob19vMTNCUGNuYnNzdUxyRDNqVkt5RDZY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;MORRISVILLE, Vt. (WCAX) - Health officials have confirmed a case of measles in Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Vermont Health Department says a school-aged child in Lamoille County was diagnosed with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;They say the child got sick after traveling internationally with their family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Health officials say the risk to the public is low because the child has been mostly isolated.

&lt;h2&gt;Texas and New Mexico&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Texas health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;on Tuesday provided an outbreak update&lt;/a&gt;, raising the case count to 223, up 25 from the 198 Texas cases reported Friday. Of the Texas cases, 29 have been hospitalized and one has died—&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/"&gt;a 6-year-old girl from Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;, the outbreak's epicenter. The girl was unvaccinated and had no known underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak continues to be primarily in unvaccinated children. Of the 223 cases, 76 are in ages 0 to 4, and 98 are between ages 5 and 17. Of the cases, 80 are unvaccinated, 138 lack vaccination status, and five are known to have received at least one dose of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One dose of MMR is estimated to be 93 percent effective against measles, and two doses offer 98 percent protection. It's not unexpected to see a small number of breakthrough cases in large, localized outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the border from Gaines County in Texas sits Lea County, where &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;New Mexico officials have now documented 32 cases,&lt;/a&gt; with an additional case reported in neighboring Eddy County, bringing the state's current total to 33. Of those cases, one person has been hospitalized and one person (not hospitalized) died. The death was an adult who did not seek medical care and tested positive for measles only after death. The cause of their death is under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of New Mexico's 33 cases, 27 were unvaccinated and five did not have a vaccination status, and one had received at least one MMR dose. Eighteen of the 33 cases are in adults, 13 are ages 0 to 17, and two cases have no confirmed age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html?"&gt;a travel alert over the measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. "With spring and summer travel season approaching in the United States, CDC emphasizes the important role that clinicians and public health officials play in preventing the spread of measles," the agency said in the alert. It advised clinicians to be vigilant in identifying potential measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency stressed the importance of vaccination, putting in bold: "&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; remains the most important tool for preventing measles,&lt;/strong&gt;" while saying that "all US residents should be up to date on their MMR vaccinations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US health secretary and long-time anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, meanwhile, has been emphasizing cod liver oil, which does not prevent measles, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-texas-kennedy-fox.html"&gt;falsely blaming the outbreak on poor nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That means that there are fewer hours in the day to do things, and there are more activities that are off limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I am restricted to doing things, socializing or meeting with folks.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her work and knowledge of long Covid is both a blessing and a curse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On one hand, it helped her get diagnosed quickly, sparing her the confusion and repeated hospital trips so &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12585569/PROFESSOR-ROB-GALLOWAY-long-covid-wrong.html"&gt;many patients have to suffer&lt;/a&gt; on their road to a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, as an expert in the field she knows she'll probably never get treated properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fatigue among the public about the pandemic means research into long Covid is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13302071/bernie-sanders-long-covid-research-symptoms.html"&gt;moving at a glacial pace&lt;/a&gt; and funding has dried up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet for Dr Cohen and up to 17million Americans with the condition, every task—showering, chores, work, socializing—drains energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Allison Cohen, an epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at the University of California San Francisco, never imagined Long Covid would upend her life, but three years later, even a run or long drives make her ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cohen says there’s often not enough energy to get through the day, making careful rationing essential. Some days, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-9292521/100-days-long-Covid-torture-counting.html"&gt;even one task feels impossible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long Covid has forced one in 10 Americans to stop working or reduce their hours, leading to higher rates of people with the condition being unable to pay their mortgage, buy food, and keep up with doctor visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of long Covid. About half of people with the wide-reaching condition meet the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome, according to researchers &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/long-covid-mecfs-and-the-importance-of-studying-infection-associated-illnesses"&gt;at Yale University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has severely limited Dr Cohen’s life, as it has millions of other former Covid patients. People have been made to put off social activities – jeopardizing friendships – and leave their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fatigue made her ‘bone tired all the time… even after sleeping solidly through the night.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dizziness and brain fog are also common complaints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trouble finding words, remembering facts, difficulty concentrating, and following conversions are some effects of brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34973396/"&gt;20 and 30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of long Covid sufferers have reported brain fog as a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That can be described as the cognitive equivalent of trying to wade through shoulder-high mud,’ Dr Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long Covid can also &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9748999/Is-whats-causing-long-Covid-Virus-stops-oxygen-flowing-body-properly-study-finds.html"&gt;affect the heart and lungs in the long term.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people with Covid, a respiratory disease, suffer long-lasting scarring that stiffens the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scarring can make it harder to breathe, caused by inflammation that strikes healthy tissue and impairs the lungs’ ability to circulate oxygen throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lasting inflammation caused by long Covid also puts &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-9944435/COVID-drove-43-spike-heart-inflammation-cases-hospitals-2020.html"&gt;extra strain on the heart&lt;/a&gt;. It can exacerbate issues that people already have in their cardiovascular system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, scarring can cause arteries to stiffen even more than plaque build-up already has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the most typical effects of Covid on the heart is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). It causes the heart to beat abnormally fast, with many having a heartbeat of 120 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inflammation damages small nerve fibers that dictate when blood vessels widen or constrict. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood vessels may not constrict properly in people with POTS. Instead, the heart rate increases even more than usual to compensate for these lazy blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There have been millions of Americans diagnosed with long Covid, which causes symptoms that last for months or even years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long-term Covid can cause lasting changes to the immune system, making it weaker and making typical infections like Covid reinfection and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-72d18f50-fea5-11ef-85e7-051a2971f0fa"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Long Covid has forced one in 10 Americans to cut work hours or stop working, leaving many unable to afford housing, food, or medical care &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cohen said: ‘The only thing we know that makes long COVID worse is getting re-infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That means I work very hard to avoid reinfection. Since I was infected while wearing an N95 mask and being vaccinated, I know that one-way masking is insufficient protection for me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given the general negative attitude toward masking, Dr Cohen does not feel entirely comfortable going out in public.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00668-8"&gt;latest research by Dr Cohen&lt;/a&gt; and her team on the antiviral Paxlovid, has yielded mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five of the 13 people in the clinical trial experienced symptom relief, such as reduced brain fog after 15 days on the drug, whereas the rest didn’t see any lasting improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cohen said: ‘We are about 5 years into the pandemic, and there are not yet any federally approved treatments for long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is not a silver bullet, but it may help a lot of people in a meaningful way.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-8839587/Long-Covid-actually-four-different-syndromes-scientists-admit-dont-know.html"&gt;over 200 symptoms&lt;/a&gt;—ranging from dizziness&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14482513/Mother-rotting-long-covid-donations-Switzerland-choice-NHS.html"&gt; to severe fatigue&lt;/a&gt; leaving people bed-bound — long Covid lacks a standard test or treatment, leading doctors to misdiagnose it as conditions like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-8e7771b0-feab-11ef-af60-1f43c4be4811" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; or asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified that an eye condition affecting the retina, the light-sensing tissue in the back of the eye, may serve as an early indicator for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings offer new insights into the potential use of retinal changes as early biomarkers for Alzheimer’s, which could &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/alzheimers-disease-risk-artificial-intelligence-3234622-2/"&gt;improve diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and treatment of neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings indicate that the presence of the APOE4 gene—known to increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease in humans in mice impairs retinal function, suggesting a direct link between this genetic variant and visual processing deficits associated with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The eye is a window to the brain reflecting changes associated with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease,” says Ashay Bhatwadekar, associate professor of ophthalmology and principal investigator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nearly 7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease, and our study will help provide ease of diagnosis and potential intervention for Alzheimer’s disease, thus enhancing patient outcomes and &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/alzheimers-drugs-extend-independent-living-3269772/"&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt; in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team used advanced imaging techniques to assess retinal structure and function in the mice. Compared to control groups, they observed significant alterations in retinal thickness and electrical activity in biological tissues and cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings align with clinical observations of retinal abnormalities in Alzheimer’s patients, reinforcing the relevance of this model for studying triggers of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrates that retinal dysfunction occurs in the APOE4 mouse model, mirroring aspects of Alzheimer’s pathology,” says PhD student Surabhi D. Abhyankar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results underscore the potential of retinal imaging as a non-invasive method to detect early neural changes in Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research appears in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.14433"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additional researchers are from Indiana University, the Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, and the University of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for this research came from the National Eye Institute and Research to Prevent Blindness.&lt;/p&gt;

Research has shown that it can take &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3662"&gt;two to three years&lt;/a&gt; after a measles infection for protective immunity to fully return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The measles virus is strongly immunosuppressive, meaning that it will interfere with the normal function of many white cells in the body that fight against other infections,” Fennelly says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;One of those infections is bacterial pneumonia, which causes inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. About one in five people who get sick with measles in the US is hospitalized, and one in 20 will develop pneumonia. In some cases, patients may need supplemental oxygen or intubation and ventilator support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL4J8tcZuSE"&gt;February 28 press briefing&lt;/a&gt;, Ron Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, described the hospitalized patients as having severe symptoms, with many of them also experiencing dehydration and low oxygen levels due to inflammation in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Pneumonia is the most common cause of death for measles in young children,” says Edith Bracho-Sanchez, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn iNCMJD callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE fJvQtP caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionText-bHjzlu iUEiRd kVUvEC iXWezO caption__text"&gt;Measles can cause serious complications in those without immunity, especially in children under 5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd isTgyB fNaHcW caption__credit"&gt;Photograph: Ezra Acayan/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles can also cause a severe complication called encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, which can be fatal. Encephalitis can happen during an infection if the virus travels to the brain, or after an infection if the brain becomes inflamed because of an overactive immune response. About one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis. The condition can cause convulsions and in rare cases, deafness or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to protect against these complications. One dose of the vaccine is 93 percent effective against measles, and two doses is 97 percent effective. The first dose is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months old, and the second dose is typically given between the ages of 4 and 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There are no antiviral treatments available for measles, and while vitamin A is often given to people with an infection, it does not prevent measles or kill the virus. “The infection itself can deplete levels of vitamin A in the body,” Bracho-Sanchez says. Both the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend two doses of vitamin A to children who are hospitalized with measles, since vitamin A deficiency can increase the risk of serious complications. However, large doses of vitamin A can be toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Secretary of health and human services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suggested that treatment with cod liver oil, which contains vitamin A, is showing “very, very good results” in measles patients. But health experts caution that cod liver oil supplements can contain more vitamin A than the recommended daily amount and can also make children sick if they take too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Bracho-Sanchez says the best way to have adequate levels of vitamin A is to eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables. Vaccination, she says, remains the best way to protect against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated 3-11-2025 7:37 pm GMT: A misidentification of a quote from Glenn Fennelly was corrected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 19:09:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQYkpQcWkxbklGQkF4LS1UNkdrVklQcWgwLXZ6UUdHT3RVVWE1VWlsTmkxSlNwQVo3S2ozTTBMUGNIbzZnWERrN2dGVmtHQ1hJZ1JIZnpnaTRFY24td1E2VFVUVnVqX21wdlBTSkdLVUZBcDVyMEpaTG9pd25tVC1ITVBRQmNpVldfblQ4VU5LbE0wNTg3YjE1U2prSHVfTXNyUTJUdA</guid></item><item><title>’27 years later I find out book worms are real’: Expert shares PSA for readers who buy their books at thrift stores - The Daily Dot</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5BQzdZSm1xNnFlRjFzOENCN0NKNWpDY2dUYTJ4c0E5NzFWQWJWSkdGS0tUMU5GYzRqdXc0NVRxNzF0eGRUd0lSWk41N1pSSDVLalVzZDFWVnlWbG05bDNYbzJhUnpEd9IBa0FVX3lxTE1ja2F4ck5PdGlwMDdIc1VaZjZLMzN3cEZ2Z3prdUYza0Z1OG1mTEhZZXdfT2NtSGpZVW9rM1l2ZGtJRUFTYjhYLUVNRUJ0R2NIaHhkTTN3a0VpTE85c2hQLTVLQ28tb3l2dmxv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content-wrapper"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whenever you think of the term “bookworm,” an avid reader may pop into your mind. But did you know bookworms are actually real? A BookToker is sharing what she does to prevent them from ruining all of her books.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="primis-wrapper ad-wrapper"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ad-wrapper__text"&gt;Featured Video&lt;/span&gt;
        
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yang (@them_yangs) is a Maryland-based BookToker. She has 272,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One time, I saw a girl on here get thrifted books and had bookworms,” she says in a video with 3 million views. “She didn’t know, so she put them with the rest of her books, and they just tore through all of them.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-make-the-same-mistake"&gt;Don’t make the same mistake &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TikToker is referring to what happened to fellow BookTok creator Izzy (@pickme.chooseme.readwme). In October of 2024, Izzy &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/news/bookworm-infestation-on-used-books/"&gt;told viewers&lt;/a&gt; to learn from her mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t listen to my friend when she said you have to freeze books,” Izzy said at the time. “And now guess what? I have bookworms.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Izzy said that the incident made her want to cry and had her nervous to open any of her books. “Freeze your books,” she warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yang is heeding Izzy’s warning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been paranoid. So whenever I get thrifted books, I always freeze them,” she says, holding copies of “All This Twisted Glory” and “Things We Never Got Over.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The content creator sticks the two books into separate freezer bags before sealing them shut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anything living in these will no longer be living by the time I get them tomorrow,” Mrs. Yang concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yang told the Daily Dot that she’s been freezing her thrifted books ever since she came across Izzy’s video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always had some idea book worms were real but finding out they were silverfish shocked me,” she says. “Now I know they aren’t just silver fish but they are one type.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-bookworms"&gt;What are bookworms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bookworms aren’t just book lovers or even worms! They’re insects that eat books and papers. According to &lt;a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/perspectives/book-lovers"&gt;the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;, these bugs can be “booklouse, silverfish, powderpost beetle, spider beetle, common furniture beetle, Mexican book beetle, paper worm (larvae of the paper beetle or moth), and larder beetle.” These creatures &lt;a href="https://artifactservices.com/emergency-care-insect-infestation-books/"&gt;feast&lt;/a&gt; on the materials of old, moldy, and damp books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yang has come across a bookworm in the past. “After I finished freezing a book for like two weeks [that] I got from a little free library, I found a bookworm in the bag,” she shared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Mrs. Yang isn’t letting bookworms scare her off. Freezing them “seems effective from my experience but I’m just some random person on the internet!” the content creator said. “I will for sure keep thrifting books!’&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;And instead of freezing her books for 24 hours, Mrs. Yang usually leaves them in the freezer for longer than that. “I usually end up leaving my books in for a week because I forget about them and many people in the comments said it needs to be at least seventy two hours!” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-viewers-were-in-disbelief"&gt;Viewers were in disbelief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people didn’t realize that bookworms aren’t just a metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“27 years later I find out book worms are real creatures,” one viewer wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“Wait, book worms are real?!?! I thought WE were the book worms,” a second echoed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Me as a librarian: is this why libraries are so cold?!? They didn’t teach that part in library school,” a third commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-this-why-libraries-maintain-chilly-temperatures"&gt;Is this why libraries maintain chilly temperatures?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is. When the building is &lt;a href="https://salve.libanswers.com/faq/335884"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt;, mold growth stops and keeps the books dry. In addition to destroying the books, mold also attracts the pesky bookworms. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thatcherwine.com/blog/cleaning-and-disinfecting-your-books"&gt;Freezing&lt;/a&gt; your used books for at least 48 hours in a plastic bag kills both them and their eggs. If you purchase any pre-owned books, be sure to pop them in the freezer before cracking them open. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@them_yangs/video/7479251054261980459" data-video-id="7479251054261980459"&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Mujica-Parodi, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, Baszucki Endowed Chair of Metabolic Neuroscience, professor of biomedical engineering, and director of the Laboratory for Computational Neurodiagnostics (LCNeuro) at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and lead author of this study told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These networks can be observed using &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5241538/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; (functional MRI), which measures blood flow in the brain, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325191" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;EEG&lt;/a&gt; (electroencephalogram), which measures neurons’ activity,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How aging affects the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When these [brain] networks ‘destabilize,’ they become less consistent in their communication patterns over time. Instead of maintaining steady connections, they switch between different configurations, defaulting from ones that are more energy-consuming to those that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7084077/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;require less energy&lt;/a&gt; to maintain. This switching behavior may reflect a compensatory strategy by the brain to conserve energy when resources are limited, but also has functional consequences for cognition.”&lt;br&gt;— Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that brain networks degrade in a non-linear way with clear transition points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, they found the effects of the degrading of brain networks is first seen around age 44, with the degeneration hitting peak acceleration around age 67, and then plateauing by age 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general, physiological systems are tasked with maintaining homeostasis: in this case, a balance between the cell’s energy demands and their energy supply,” Mujica-Parodi explained. “When physiological systems lose the ability to maintain that balance (i.e., they become ‘dysregulated’), it puts stress on the system. That stress itself further disrupts the balance, which is why chronic diseases often are degenerative — they become worse and worse over time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After a point, the system is so disrupted, with so many secondary and tertiary effects, that fixing the original problem no longer helps,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A critical age window&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our study suggests that, while diminished access to energy is the driving mechanism, seen in the 40’s, eventually, the degenerative effects compound, thereby accelerating a process in the 60’s that sets the trajectory for a path that is harder to reverse. By analogy, we can think of the brain’s neurons like a bustling city. Each building needs a steady supply of electricity to function properly. When the power grid experiences a brief outage, the town goes dark, but once power is restored, everything returns to normal with no lasting damage.” &lt;br&gt;— Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, imagine that same city experiencing a prolonged, severe power outage lasting months. Initially, emergency generators keep essential services running, but eventually, those backups fail,” Mujica-Parodi added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Water systems stop working, causing pipes to freeze and burst. Buildings deteriorate without climate control, and infrastructure begins to crumble. By the time power is finally restored, significant structural damage has occurred that simply turning the electricity back on cannot fix. Thus, the significance of our finding is that it’s easier to cure a problem while it’s still small,” she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this study, Mujica-Parodi and her team also discovered that the primary driver of aging brain networks is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8513144/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;neuronal insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, led by an Alzheimer’s risk factor protein called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9644639/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;APOE&lt;/a&gt; and the insulin-dependent glucose transporter &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537322/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;GLUT4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, researchers did find that a neuronal &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554523/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;ketone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; transporter called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9388117/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;MCT2&lt;/a&gt; might provide protection against these drivers of brain network aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurons can use two types of fuel for energy: &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/249413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; (sugar) and ketones (derived from &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/essential-fatty-acids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;). Most neurons in the brain primarily use &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9019065/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;GLUT3&lt;/a&gt; (not GLUT4) transporters to take up glucose. GLUT4, which is the insulin-responsive glucose transporter found abundantly in muscle and fat tissue, is present in only specific regions of the brain,” Mujica-Parodi detailed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This limited distribution of GLUT4 in the brain is significant because it means most brain energy metabolism was traditionally thought to be insulin-independent. However, the neuroscience field is gradually discovering that insulin signaling in the brain is more important than previously believed,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linking ketones and brain aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When neurons become insulin-resistant, they lose the ability to access glucose as fuel, but not ketones. This means that ketones can function as a ‘back door’ to feeding neurons whose access to glucose would otherwise be blocked by insulin resistance. MCT2 is the primary transporter that enables ketones to enter neurons in the brain. This distribution allows neurons to efficiently uptake ketones when glucose availability is limited, such as during &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/295914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fasting&lt;/a&gt; or on a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, the presence of MCT2 is essential for the brain’s ability to utilize ketones as an alternative fuel source, which explains why it might be protective as the brain ages.”&lt;br&gt;— Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this study’s findings, we asked two experts whether or not following a keto diet might help protect the brain as it ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/neurology/ca/santa-monica/verna-porter-1730107012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Verna Porter, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified neurologist and director of the Dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease and Neurocognitive Disorders at Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; she found the identification of neuronal insulin resistance and the role of metabolic interventions to be very interesting, particularly the potential of ketones, since this may offer a promising direction in the prevention of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on the findings of the study, the concept of using ketones as an alternative brain fuel is intriguing,” Porter continued. “Ketosis may indeed help protect against cognitive decline by providing neurons with energy when glucose metabolism is impaired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[M]ore research is needed to confirm whether a ketogenic diet can consistently be maintained and offer long-term protection, particularly in individuals at risk for Alzheimer’s, and whether it can be effectively incorporated into a broader treatment regimen.”&lt;br&gt;— Verna Porter, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also asked &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/gary-small/1835313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Gary Small, MD&lt;/a&gt;, chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey for his thoughts on this topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research not only confirms the importance of early intervention in preventing cognitive decline, but it also elucidates a mechanism for what’s triggering the decline and the therapeutic timing for effective intervention,” Small explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The findings do support the hypothesis that a keto diet during mid-life may be an effective strategy for preventing cognitive decline in late life,” he said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A clinical trial of a keto diet that increases insulin resistance in the brain in middle-aged volunteers could lead to a whole new intervention strategy for preventing late-life cognitive decline,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:55:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPR1R1STFqc2dBdDVZWlU2NXVTb0lhbzFjemp1VldsZk9sZUNTb25aV0ZCR0JtVWhoMlRNcXFzdmNEczJVcUg2LTVKbmJJcXI2Nkh4SS11djRqODM5SDRYczlGRVl0cWNwVHV1OGduVE1qc2VHcTdkTjlJWUR3dlYxdVkwb0ZqREQ1RndxdmpBaC1POWZuSi1jVUllbjU4REkyWTNj</guid></item><item><title>Once-yearly jab for HIV protection passes first trial hurdle -

              &lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak in Texas is continuing to rage on, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—the newly enshrined Health and Human Services secretary—is touting scientifically unsupported treatments for it. In a recent interview, Kennedy espoused the supposed benefits of supplements and steroids for measles patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. has been making the rounds publicly as of late to discuss the federal government’s response to the Texas measles outbreak, which has affected over 200 residents since mid-January. In a 35-minute interview with Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel, &lt;a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/watch/d5c0ee929861616db083854daa058a56/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; last week, Kennedy made many dubious claims related to measles, which included arguing that cod liver oil pills, steroids, and antibiotics could be useful treatments for the viral disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cod liver oil supplements are known to contain omega-3 fatty acids as well as vitamins A and D. Research has shown that a measles infection can be more severe in children with vitamin A deficiency, and groups like the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20(WHO)%20recommends%20a%20daily%20oral%20dose%20of%20vitamin%20A%20for%20two%20days%20to%20children%20with%20measles%20living%20in%20areas%20where%20vitamin%20A%20deficiency%20may%20be%20present."&gt;do recommend&lt;/a&gt; that doctors provide vitamin A to measles-infected children in regions where deficiency is common.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, vitamin A deficiency is incredibly rare in the U.S. (perhaps affecting &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK567744/#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%20(US,and%20low%20absorption.%5B17%5D"&gt;around 0.3%&lt;/a&gt; of the general population). Moreover, the benefits of vitamin A for measles are thought to come from very high doses of it—doses much higher than what is typically found in a cod liver oil pill. There appears to be no evidence that cod liver oil itself can be beneficial for measles. People can also suffer from vitamin A toxicity if they take too many supplements, and toxicity appears to be a &lt;a href="https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/nutrition-food-safety-health/fat-soluble-vitamins-a-d-e-and-k-9-315/#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20toxic,which%20appears%20to%20be%20safe."&gt;bigger problem&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. than deficiency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. also praised the value of budesonide, a steroid, and an antibiotic called clarithromycin, claiming that local doctors had seen almost “miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries after using such treatments. Doctors have occasionally used steroids for serious measles cases, including during a 2017 outbreak in Italy. A 2023 study examining this outbreak &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37820949/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that steroid use wasn’t associated with worse outcomes. However, there’s no clear evidence that steroids should be a standard treatment for the disease. Antibiotics can be used to treat secondary bacterial infections that could emerge from measles, but generally aren’t able to directly treat viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;During the interview, Kennedy also tried to downplay the threat of measles, appearing to imply that severe and life-threatening cases usually only happen in people with poor diets and a lack of exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s very, very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person,” he explained, claiming there’s a “correlation between people who get hurt by measles and people who don’t have good nutrition or who don’t have a good exercise regimen.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It is true that malnutrition can be a risk factor for severe measles and other infections. But measles can absolutely kill healthy people, especially if they’re young. Texas health officials &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the sole measles death seen in the state so far involved a school-age child who had no known underlying conditions; the child was unvaccinated, however. Measles vaccination is both highly effective at preventing infection and at reducing the severity of any infections that do rarely occur. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles vaccination programs worldwide have &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles#:~:text=Accelerated%20immunization%20activities,(1)."&gt;prevented&lt;/a&gt; some 60 million deaths from measles since 2000.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has been more supportive of measles vaccination lately, but certainly nothing approaching what’s required and expected of a public health leader. In both the Fox News interview and an op-ed &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, he acknowledged that the vaccine can prevent measles and that it should be widely recommended in communities where the vaccination rate is relatively low. At the same time, he claimed that these vaccines are riskier than commonly believed by many experts and that vaccination should be a personal choice. RFK Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/rfk-jr-vaccine-disinformation/"&gt;long spread misinformation&lt;/a&gt; about the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and others, including by supporting a debunked link between the MMR shots and autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, the agencies under Kennedy’s new HHS have also taken steps to undermine the public’s confidence in vaccines. The CDC is &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-to-re-investigate-vaccines-and-autism-despite-decades-of-evidence-showing-no-link-2000573773"&gt;reportedly planning&lt;/a&gt; a new large study that will once again reexamine whether vaccines can cause autism, for instance, despite decades of evidence showing otherwise. And the National Institutes of Health is no longer &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2025-03-11/nih-cuts-funding-for-studies-on-vaccine-hesitancy-and-acceptance"&gt;funding research&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reducing vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the United States following a successful, national vaccination program — transmission of the disease &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;had ceased within America&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but even now, measles has yet to be eradicated worldwide. The continued spread of measles in other countries and lapses in America's vaccination rates leaves the country vulnerable to outbreaks like the one happening in Texas right now. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/1st-death-reported-in-texas-measles-outbreak-what-to-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/1st-death-reported-in-texas-measles-outbreak-what-to-know"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The ongoing outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has so far claimed &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/2nd-measles-death-reported-in-us-outbreak-was-in-new-mexico-adult" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/2nd-measles-death-reported-in-us-outbreak-was-in-new-mexico-adult"&gt;&lt;u&gt;two lives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with cases increasing due to the incredibly high transmissibility of measles and low vaccination rates in the affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this adapted excerpt from his book &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670274/booster-shots-by-adam-ratner-md-mph/" data-url="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670274/booster-shots-by-adam-ratner-md-mph/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Booster Shots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Penguin Random House, 2025), pediatrician and infectious disease specialist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1972558187/adam-j-ratner" target="_blank" data-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1972558187/adam-j-ratner" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Adam Ratner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looks at a historical measles outbreak in Texarkana, a city at the border of Texas and Arkansas. In the outbreak, the side of the state line people happened to live on determined their fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;True to its name, Texarkana straddles the border between the states of Texas and Arkansas. In the 1960s, about two-thirds of the population lived in the part of the city that was in Bowie County, Texas, with the remainder residing in Miller County, Arkansas. The division did not generally affect the day-to-day workings of the city, with residents of both counties attending the same local businesses, churches, and events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, separate public schools and public health departments were maintained on either side of the state line. Texarkana was a natural laboratory to understand how policy choices could dictate health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late June 1970, a 5-year-old Texarkana boy who had traveled out of the area was diagnosed with measles. He represented the first recognized case in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5068077/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5068077/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that would last more than six months and involve more than 600 people, mostly children. That isn't the remarkable part — measles outbreaks were becoming more frequent everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;On the Texas side of the Texarkana state line, fewer than 60% of children between 1 and 9 years old were immune to measles in 1970. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: DenisTangneyJr/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What made Texarkana different is that State Line Avenue separated two jurisdictions with quite different approaches to measles vaccination. Texas had no requirement for measles vaccination prior to school entry and generally eschewed mass vaccination campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer than 60% of 1- to 9-year-olds on the Texas side were immune to measles either through vaccination or prior illness. In contrast, Arkansas maintained a school mandate and had held mass immunization campaigns for preschool- and school-aged children in each of the two years prior to the outbreak. An estimated 95% of their 1- to 9-year-olds were immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-E5UeDq3bxhGZCnrtuwhSJN" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-E5UeDq3bxhGZCnrtuwhSJN slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was striking. A political division, not a physical one, determined who got measles and who didn't. Of the 633 Texarkana measles cases, 606 (nearly 96% of the total) occurred in people who resided in the Texas portion of the city. This disparity in rates occurred despite significant contact between residents from the two sides. The messages were clear — vaccination had protected children who happened to reside on the Arkansas side of town, and community campaigns and school mandates were highly effective in preventing measles spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/measles-deaths-jumped-over-40-from-2021-to-2022-cdc-reports" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/measles-deaths-jumped-over-40-from-2021-to-2022-cdc-reports"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles deaths jumped over 40% from 2021 to 2022, CDC reports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texarkana story is frequently cited in public health circles and is used as a teaching case for students of epidemiology. The lesson that is sometimes missed is that in addition to showing that vaccination protects against disease, the Texarkana measles outbreak also provides a stark reminder that political decisions about funding for public health, acceptability of school mandates, and myriad other issues can have real and lasting effects on the health of populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Measles cases in the U.S. have been rising since 2024. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Texarkana's unusual geographic and political arrangement continues to instruct us about the deeply intertwined nature of politics and health. Under the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3590/text" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3590/text" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ACA, also known as Obamacare), which was passed in 2010, states were required to expand Medicaid coverage to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, with coverage going into effect in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2012 Supreme Court decision (&lt;em&gt;National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius&lt;/em&gt;) made states' acceptance of the ACA's Medicaid expansion funds optional rather than mandatory. Arkansas accepted Medicaid expansion; Texas did not. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jonathanmetzl.com/about" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.jonathanmetzl.com/about" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jonathan M.

It is hard to imagine a place where that line is so sharply drawn as in Texarkana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://publichealthwatch.org/2023/04/10/medicaid-expansion-texarkana-texas-arkansas-health/" target="_blank" data-url="https://publichealthwatch.org/2023/04/10/medicaid-expansion-texarkana-texas-arkansas-health/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 report from Public Health Watch&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [a nonprofit news organization] detailed a "widening divide in health care access" between the two sides of Texarkana on the basis of those decisions. Despite the demographic similarities between the Texas and Arkansas sides of the city, after nine years of Medicaid expansion, the differences were stark. More non-elderly adults uninsured, more hospitalizations for life-threatening conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, worse access to care — these are the legacy of Texas's refusal to accept the ACA's Medicaid expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the 1970 measles outbreak made clear, in Texarkana, living on the wrong side of State Line Avenue can be hazardous to your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From "&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670274/booster-shots-by-adam-ratner-md-mph/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670274/booster-shots-by-adam-ratner-md-mph/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Booster Shots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;", by Adam Ratner, MD, MPH, published on February 11, 2025, by Avery, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.

This death count places the coronavirus among the deadliest disease outbreaks in recorded history. Epidemics and pandemics have taken their toll on humanity throughout the centuries and even though much has changed in the modern age, the devastation from the loss of life in disease outbreaks has remained the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/historys-seven-deadliest-plagues" target="_blank"&gt;Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, published data &lt;/a&gt;on the seven deadliest disease outbreaks in history in 2021 and even then, estimates of the extrapolated Covid-19 death toll already placed the pandemic among them. While Covid-19 might be more similar from an outbreak perspective to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1920, another one is actually closer in time to it: The HIV/AIDS pandemic. First reported in 1981, the disease spread rapidly around the world and peaked at 1.6 million annual deaths in 2004. Since then this number has halved and experts believe that the pandemic as a public health threat can be ended by 2030 due to advanced medications and public health campaigns limiting the disease's spread. While fewer people die of AIDS today, the disease has claimed 27-48 million lives globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak on the list that claimed the most lives is the so-called Black Death plague epidemic that took place in Europe, North Africa and Asia in the Middle Ages, from around 1334 to 1353. The outbreak ist estimated to have killed up to 200 million people, decimating the European population by 30 to 60 percent. There are actually three outbreaks of the plague, a bacterial disease, among the deadliest pandemics and epidemics in the world, also including the Plague of the Justinian in late antiquity (541-549) as well as a third outbreak of the disease in the 19th and 20th century, killing 12 million people mostly in India and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter was - together with the less deadly cholera and influenza outbreaks of the 19th century - the first pandemic that reached the entire world, while previous outbreaks were also often classified as Old World pandemics. The New World smallpox epidemic is an abnormality in this context, as it ravaged native American populations that did not have a built-up tolerance to the disease, killing 25 to 55 million people in the 1500s and 1600s.

This death count places the coronavirus among the deadliest disease outbreaks in recorded history. Epidemics and pandemics have taken their toll on humanity throughout the centuries and even though much has changed in the modern age, the devastation from the loss of life in disease outbreaks has remained the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/historys-seven-deadliest-plagues" target="_blank"&gt;Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, published data &lt;/a&gt;on the seven deadliest disease outbreaks in history in 2021 and even then, estimates of the extrapolated Covid-19 death toll already placed the pandemic among them. While Covid-19 might be more similar from an outbreak perspective to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1920, another one is actually closer in time to it: The HIV/AIDS pandemic. First reported in 1981, the disease spread rapidly around the world and peaked at 1.6 million annual deaths in 2004. Since then this number has halved and experts believe that the pandemic as a public health threat can be ended by 2030 due to advanced medications and public health campaigns limiting the disease's spread. While fewer people die of AIDS today, the disease has claimed 27-48 million lives globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak on the list that claimed the most lives is the so-called Black Death plague epidemic that took place in Europe, North Africa and Asia in the Middle Ages, from around 1334 to 1353. The outbreak ist estimated to have killed up to 200 million people, decimating the European population by 30 to 60 percent. There are actually three outbreaks of the plague, a bacterial disease, among the deadliest pandemics and epidemics in the world, also including the Plague of the Justinian in late antiquity (541-549) as well as a third outbreak of the disease in the 19th and 20th century, killing 12 million people mostly in India and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter was - together with the less deadly cholera and influenza outbreaks of the 19th century - the first pandemic that reached the entire world, while previous outbreaks were also often classified as Old World pandemics. The New World smallpox epidemic is an abnormality in this context, as it ravaged native American populations that did not have a built-up tolerance to the disease, killing 25 to 55 million people in the 1500s and 1600s. Finally, the Spanish flu is often called the first true pandemic as with the increased connectedness of the world in the 20th century came the faster spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The words epidemic and pandemic refer to a sudden increase of the spread of an infectious disease, in a limited area or all around the (connected) world at the time.

In terrible shape, with lifetimes of practice overcoming great challenges: to Fiatarone, they were perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Beginning in the late 1980s, Fiatarone ran a series of studies in which she asked residents to commit to a regimen of high-intensity strength training. To many of her colleagues, the research seemed risky. Conventional wisdom in medicine at that time said the oldest people were not capable of lifting heavy weights – it might cause cardiac events. In all of western medical literature, Fiatarone found no evidence that any doctor had ever previously tried to teach frail 90-year-olds to do this kind of training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But she pressed forward with the research, and the Hebrew rehab lifters&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;produced unprecedented proof that high-intensity progressive resistance training can strengthen and build muscle even for the oldest people, with life-changing effects. Hebrew rehab residents who lifted weights gained power to function more independently, and to live with more autonomy and dignity, into their last years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0d9aef86-9046-4297-bb0d-1c3f691b2769" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;The Hebrew rehab lifters showed that strength training can be not only safe for practically everyone but also feasible.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Reproduced with permission of The Jewish Advocate, copyrighted, all rights reserved.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Of the 10 residents Fiatarone chose for the first study – six women and four men – eight had a history of falls. Seven used canes or walkers to get around. Most were on at least four medications. Most had at least four chronic diseases. The most common diseases in this group were osteoarthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Their workout program would be simple. It would consist of one exercise. The exercise was the knee extension. Picture someone sitting on the edge of a straight-backed chair. She contracts her quadriceps to extend her knees, lifting her lower legs. At the top of the motion, both legs extend straight out from her lap. Then she bends her knees to lower her shins and feet back down. The lift comprising that whole movement, up and down, is called the knee extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Two things make the knee extension a good exercise for 90-year-olds. You can do it sitting down, and it strengthens muscles that help you stand up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;To begin the study, Fiatarone and colleagues conducted maximal strength tests, determining the heaviest weight each person was able to lift one time with perfect form and through a full range of motion – their “one-repetition maximum”, or 1-RM. On average, the 10 maxed out at lifting less than 20lb. One person lifted almost 40. One person lifted about five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Each of the 10 residents then started coming to the physiotherapy room for three strength training sessions per week. In the first week, they lifted weights equal to 50% of their 1-RM, and for the rest of the two-month program, they lifted 80% of 1-RM. Their muscles adapted quickly, so the 1-RM tests were repeated every other week, to keep their efforts at 80% of maximum, allowing for consistent progress in their training to get stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One month into the two-month program, an 86-year-old man dropped out – an old hernia repair was bothering him – and then there were nine. In each training session, the lifters completed three sets of eight repetitions. They raised and lowered the weights very slowly: three or four seconds up, three or four seconds down. Between each of the three sets, they rested for a minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There were no cardiovascular complications among the nine. They lifted and lowered the weight so slowly that their blood pressure and pulse rates (which were continuously monitored)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;barely changed. Four of the nine occasionally reported some discomfort in the hips or knees, but not to the point where anyone had to take a pain reliever or miss a training session. Everyone was able to do what was asked of them. And everyone did it. The study’s attendance rate was 98.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"link to other well actually stories","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"7d257784-51ae-4f0d-857a-174109b244fb","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="7d257784-51ae-4f0d-857a-174109b244fb" data-alt="link to other well actually stories" data-testid="interactive-element-link%20to%20other%20well%20actually%20stories" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;link to other well actually stories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;These people were dedicated, and they got stronger. The smallest strength gain was 61%. The largest was 374%. The average gain was 174%. The average increase in walking speed as measured by tandem gait was almost 50%. The magnitude of improvements for men and women were the same. Their muscles had not only grown stronger, but also bigger. In 1990, the Journal of the American Medical Association published &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/382128" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;results of Fiatarone’s study&lt;/a&gt;, a paper now widely considered to mark the start of a paradigm shift in scientific understanding of muscle, strength and ageing.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The 90-year-olds’ muscles grew by almost the same amount that a younger person’s muscles would grow in response to a similar lifting program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;When Fiatarone began her research, she confronted skepticism and prejudice, stemming from ambivalence about muscle and weight training that was baked into medicine and mainstream popular culture. Even as she first proved that progressive resistance exercise is critical to long-term health for all, weight training was widely scorned, slighted and dismissed as hedonistic and extreme – because it was linked in that era’s headline news with steroid scandals, a newly reported psychiatric disorder among bodybuilders that would eventually be named “muscle dysmorphia”, and Saturday Night Live’s Hans and Franz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Fiatarone was not distracted or deterred. Her studies of weight training, built upon and inspired by others’ research on younger subjects, helped establish a new perspective on their subject: for young and old alike, muscle-strengthening exercises can be a locus of regeneration, offering chances for growth and development; for service and self-improvement; and for healing and renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;From birth, through the typical course of growth, most people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522004907?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;build muscle&lt;/a&gt; up to a peak at the age of 30 or so. Then comes decline, when people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522004889?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;lose muscle&lt;/a&gt; at a rate of at least 3-5% per decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;By the time we are older, in our 60s and 70s, the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119597896.ch2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rate of loss&lt;/a&gt; can accelerate to roughly 1% a year, or 10% a decade. General physical activity &lt;a href="https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jab/29/5/article-p535.xml" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;does not prevent&lt;/a&gt; age-related loss of muscle, but with progressive resistance training, the losses can be slowed, or even substantially reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Even in the short time of Fiatarone’s eight-week study at Hebrew rehab, when older people’s muscles changed, their lives changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dorothy Tishler was 92. In her first session she lifted 17lb with each leg. Eight weeks later, her strength had more than tripled. She lifted 60lb with each leg. “I love it,” she told the reporter from the Jewish Advocate who visited the gym. “I have become younger. When I came here five years ago, I could hardly walk. Now I walk better than my daughter, who’s only 72.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Strength training is safe – this was the most important truth established by the Hebrew rehab study. In structured regimens overseen by qualified trainers, high-intensity strength training involves very low risk, even for the frailest, oldest people. As Fiatarone wrote, edging as near sarcasm as the idiom of medical literature allows: “The known hazards of immobility and falls seem to outweigh the potential risks of muscle strengthening interventions in this population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fiatarone would later say: “To me, it was always the idea to keep exercise simple, keep focused on what was the most feasible thing to do.” Strength training is feasible in nursing homes, she says, whereas aerobic training may not be. To some, that may sound counterintuitive, but it’s the commonsense conclusion of her experience working with the oldest people. She continues: “When you go to a nursing home, it’s quite clear that people can’t do lots of kinds of aerobic exercise. Simple walking is really hard. Yet people can sit at a machine and lift heavy weights. It’s very much the opposite of what people think.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he Hebrew rehab strength-training study had extensive practical implications. Its philosophical implications were at least as far-reaching. What happened at Hebrew rehab upended the traditional story of ageing. The cliché of inevitable decline – as age increases, function wanes – turned out to be false. What happened in Dorothy Tishler’s legs suggested nothing less than a new way of considering the course of human life. The cliche that it’s never too late turned out to be true. Even into oldest age, even in dire situations, every person has some power to change how time changes the body. Especially if you have help, and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1967a6a3-69d5-48a7-a52f-6eb154b11413" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;What happened at Hebrew rehab upended the traditional story of ageing.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Silvia Jansen/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Still, the Hebrew rehab lifters had not conquered time. Their example offered hope to others, but demanding hope. “All subjects resumed their sedentary lifestyle” after the study ended, Fiatarone found in follow-up visits with them. They resumed their sedentary lifestyle because the nursing home had no system or program in place to help them continue training. One month after the nine stopped lifting, they had lost, on average, a third of what they had gained during three months of workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Changes in muscle function are not maintained in the absence of continued training,” Fiatarone wrote in the published study. Ongoing improvement would require “an ongoing program of muscle reconditioning”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="52baab9f-2d9b-49aa-9fbc-28b93d87aaa1" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"How do I stay healthy in my 70s?","elementId":"52baab9f-2d9b-49aa-9fbc-28b93d87aaa1","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/03/health-tips-70s-longevity"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Changes in muscle are not maintained for long periods of time, in the absence of continued training – for anyone, of any age. Up to the age of 35 or so, most younger people are, however, able to maintain muscular strength and mass with minimal frequency of exercise – as little as one workout per week, involving as little as one set per exercise. Likewise, most older people who have gotten stronger at the gym can maintain their increased ability to exert force with the same modest number of workouts, just one per week. Maintaining muscle mass for older people seems to require more exercise, though – at least two workouts per week, involving at least two or three sets per exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;By 1992, four years after the first small group of residents at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center began lifting weights, workouts had become a fixture of the culture of this nursing home. About half the residents had adopted some kind of strength training regimen by the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;An article in the Jewish Advocate in 1999 marked 1o years since the newspaper covered Fiatarone’s first strength training study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Is the program merely the outgrowth of a perverse and impossible forever-young culture,” asked an intrepid reporter, “or is there meaning behind the madness? What is it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s a godsend, that’s what it is,” Ben Engleman said. He was 93 years old. He had been a shoe salesman in Swampscott, Massachusetts. When he arrived at the nursing home, he could not comb his hair or tie his tie. Four years later, because he followed a strength-training regimen, he was able to make himself look sharp again, without needing a hand from anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Maria Fiatarone’s discoveries that older people could build muscle, strength and functional abilities by lifting heavy weights were reproduced by many other researchers around the world. Nevertheless, in most of the medical profession, as in global popular culture, ignorance about older people’s potential to build muscle and strength persists, as part of a general failure to recognize the centrality of muscle in human life and health for everyone, throughout the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 16:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQU2xxMDBaNVNPQjQwaXhDLWN6cEdkZTZiYlU5ckI2eWk2UVRsSEw4RWxkY3hubC1wb0tMNnBxa1FpeFlFOWR4LUV3Rm94aHBNbVZuck1pTmh3OXB4VkI4dklsWGRiLUJRdUJhNGF4N2hYS0JqTjdpYnFQejJDUmZBbHRIa2lsUQ</guid></item><item><title>Bacterial slime on microplastics help breed antibiotic-resistant superbugs, study says - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQOUpyZ0dBR2FoNF9IZThibzRIR21kM3U4MzNSWC00RmNWMkxRLUo1V0k2Vnk0ODliNTJPYm9yMElxSWNfWlQ5N2YyX1g3Y0psLW1naGpDV3dwY0ppQzRaN3BwY2NId0t6Q1B1U1RUNXd1aDVmcDBwNERtR2dteHQtRmtwSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;CNN&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By being an excellent host for slimy biofilms created by bacteria to protect themselves from attack, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/health/microplastics-nose-wellness/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:microplastics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; may be contributing to the proliferation of dangerous &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/health/antibiotic-resistant-superbug-infections-2050-wellness/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:antibiotic-resistant superbugs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;antibiotic-resistant superbugs&lt;/a&gt;, a new study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microplastics are like rafts — a bacteria on its own might not be able to swim down a river, but riding in its biofilm on a tiny bit of plastic it can be disseminated into many different environments,” said study first author Neila Gross, a doctoral student in materials science and engineering at Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biofilms are protective three-dimensional structures created by bacteria from its own waste. Much like an armored and insulated house, the oozy goo allows bacteria to safely live, thrive and replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many surfaces can host biofilms — the plaque on your teeth is a biofilm — plastics appear to provide an especially strong bond that attracts the most prolific bacteria, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biofilms work so well, in fact, that they can increase antibiotic resistance hundreds to thousands of times above what’s normal, Zaman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biofilms are pretty nasty to get off because they’re super sticky and they allow the bacteria to respond to any antimicrobial assault by enemies such as antibiotics. Once that happens, the problem becomes very hard to manage,” said senior study author Muhammad Zaman, a &lt;a href="https://www.hhmi.org/programs/investigators" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Howard Hughes Medical Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Howard Hughes Medical Institute &lt;/a&gt;professor and professor of biomedical engineering and global health at Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found the link between microplastics and how they how they lead to antimicrobial resistance is both real and not limited to a single antibiotic,” Zaman said. “It’s broad, impacting many commonly used antibiotics, which makes it really, really concerning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Microplastics range in size from 1 nanometer to 5 millimeters, with the largest about the size of a pencil eraser, experts say. - Svetlozar Hristov/iStockphoto/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stronger, faster and more antibiotic resistant&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.02282-24" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Applied Environmental and Microbiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Applied Environmental and Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed biofilms on microplastics and glass created by E. coli, a potentially dangerous bacteria that can cause diarrhea and stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In test tubes in the lab, researchers exposed those biofilms to four widely used antibiotics: ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, fluoroquinolone and ampicillin. All are broad-spectrum antibiotics used to treat many different types of bacterial illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the E. coli biofilms were on microplastics, they grew dramatically faster, larger and more antibiotic-resistant than biofilms growing on glass spheres, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the rate of antibiotic resistance by the E. coli grown on microplastics was so high that Gross repeated the tests multiple times using different types of microplastics and combinations of antibiotics. The results remained consistent, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the E. coli bacteria grown on microplastics kept their ability to form stronger biofilms even when removed from the microplastic, Gross said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These bacteria were not only resistant to antibiotics, but they were also better at creating biofilm,” she said. “For microplastics to facilitate bacteria to be these faster, better biofilm formers is quite concerning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, while interesting, need to be replicated, said Shilpa Chokshi, a professor of environmental hepatology at the University of Plymouth, England, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a lab study using E. coli and four antibiotics under controlled conditions, which does not fully replicate real-world complexity,” Chokshi said in a statement. “Further research is needed to assess whether these effects translate to human infections or environmental settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 15:58:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQOUpyZ0dBR2FoNF9IZThibzRIR21kM3U4MzNSWC00RmNWMkxRLUo1V0k2Vnk0ODliNTJPYm9yMElxSWNfWlQ5N2YyX1g3Y0psLW1naGpDV3dwY0ppQzRaN3BwY2NId0t6Q1B1U1RUNXd1aDVmcDBwNERtR2dteHQtRmtwSQ</guid></item><item><title>Chronic wasting disease found in farmed deer in mid-Michigan - MLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNb05LcEpvQUktQkNaMUZCNlN2N2hqaDRiMGYzdnBhaGZrN0t6UlhleWRVTGhGQzZtaldhbTNXNkJKQnVZcW1rUDVaVVRTcWNPakF6SVRTVUhwTjNpVlduUDB2Z2hwX296ME9uS3hKejlFWmx0WWlfV241MDJJS2NMX2w4WUtRQlhFTE1jVEVHeEJ4cHJZMDQtOFFobFMtNEhoREHSAbYBQVVfeXFMTm1NbFBGWmFyaXlycWFlNlFtRkdEN25xeUtaQ3lYQUtJdHhSUXdYWEZqOWlvU29BMVY0cFQwVTFXY29uYmE1T0laQWhfaWRJRTh4RDRoS3JrY0pwUU9BMVpKU1ZMRC1wcFB0aXVqUzBQNGFGZ1EzX3JMazVRZzd6ZWhNUDFZMVBoMDh0R3BMUFVkWFFXNUZrRXlIZ0VnUnNieW4wSDUxUk9IXy1BVFJkUjgxT3pQT2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UDPL5PYLFNHQ3FON6DXO3Q6MQY"&gt;A case of chronic wasting disease has been confirmed in a farmed white-tailed deer in mid-Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="O6CDWFFFGZDXBMQFH5EEXX7LDA"&gt;The case involved a 7-year-old deer from Osceola County, the Michigan Department of Agriculture &amp;amp; Rural Development (MDARD) reported Tuesday, March 11. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EWJQ6HKXINEBRJRROEOSV7YIII"&gt;Investigations are ongoing to determine if there are any additional exposures to other deer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BHUIERQADBGMTGJYVMNONDCMBA"&gt;Chronic wasting disease is a contagious illness believed to be caused by proteins.

&lt;p&gt;Once eaten by a human, the L3 larvae try to complete their life cycle by burrowing into tissue out of the intestines to get to the brain, traveling either through the blood or along nerves. The migration along nerves can cause sensory abnormalities, like burning, tingling, or pain. Once in the central nervous system, the invasion can cause confusion, encephalopathy, seizure, cranial neuropathy, or eye problems. In a brain, the L3 larvae would normally develop into young adults, but human brains are dead ends for the worms, which eventually die there without fully maturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the luckiest rat lungworm victims don't need treatment and make full recoveries after the larvae die off on their own. But the woman in this case was not so lucky. Her doctors noted in their report that the worms typically stay in the pia mater of the brain, a delicate innermost layer of tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. They rarely cause lesions in the white matter, a deeper tissue containing nerve fibers that transmit signals between different parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-content right"&gt;
              &lt;span class="ars-gallery-caption-text"&gt;FLAIR MRI of the brain four months after treatment showed that the lesions adjacent to the lateral ventricles significantly decreased compared with those before treatment.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her case, the worms appeared to be directly and actively invading her white matter, which was captured by the FLAIR MRIs. The lesions progressed "rapidly" in the three days after eating the uncooked crayfish and the two weeks when she was misdiagnosed and treated for a bacterial infection (labeled as "after treatment" in the second image). The authors noted that the lesions looked significantly different from the lesions seen when white matter is damaged from a lack of blood flow, such as in a stroke. This "may be related to direct invasion of &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; or inflammation of small vessels," they speculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there isn't a clearly defined standard treatment for such infections, the doctors started the woman on an anti-parasitic drug called albendazole, which is often used. After two weeks, her symptoms improved, and she was able to communicate again. After four months, a third FLAIR MRI showed a "significant reduction" in white matter lesions. It's unclear, however, if she made a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A class of drugs commonly used to treat movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease and restless leg syndrome is pushing people into risky sexual behavior. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patients taking dopamine agonists say the drugs have triggered uncontrollable impulses, including flashing, sex addiction and even pedophilia — leaving them struggling with feelings of shame and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reports &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkmrev6z2mo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reviewed by the BBC&lt;/a&gt; suggest drugmaker GSK has known about the risk of so-called “deviant” sexual behavior since 2003, yet patients claim their doctors continue to fail to warn them about these potentially devastating side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dopamine agonists are commonly used for treating movement disorders.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Africa Studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dopamine agonists mimic &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/20/lifestyle/inside-dopamine-dressing-the-latest-trend-of-dressing-for-a-pick-me-up/"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, a key brain chemical that controls movement and is activated by pleasure. However, these drugs can overstimulate feelings of pleasure while dulling the brain’s ability to recognize the consequences of our actions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can lead to impulse control disorders, with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X22001225#:~:text=Long%2Dterm%20treatment%20with%20dopaminergic,Weiss%20and%20Marsh%2C%202012)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; 13% to 24% of Parkinson’s patients on dopamine agonists develop them. While a warning about these risky behaviors is listed alongside common side effects like nausea and insomnia, research suggests they often go &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3613210/#:~:text=Although%20ICD%20are%20not%20rare,serious%20side%20effects%20were%20reported." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;unnoticed or undiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.11390" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; the drugs only be used for short-term treatment, such as end-of-life care.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;A 2003 report from GSK reviewed by BBC described two cases of deviant sexual behavior in men who were prescribed the dopamine agonists Ropinirole for Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one, a 63-year-old man sexually assaulted a 7-year-old girl. The report said the perpetrator’s libido had increased significantly from the start of his treatment and his “problem subsequently resolved” after his dose was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least 20 women prescribed dopamine agonists for restless leg syndrome told the BBC that the drugs ruined their lives. Many said they weren’t warned about the serious side effects and had no idea what was causing their erratic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dopamine agonists are commonly prescribed to treat restless leg syndrome, which more commonly affects women.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andrey Popov – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One woman, Claire, recounted how she began leaving her house in the early hours to search for sex. About a year after starting Ropinirole, which had initially relieved her RLS symptoms, she began experiencing overwhelming and unprecedented sexual urges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wearing a see-through top and jacket, she would regularly flash her chest at any man she could, despite having a partner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There remains an element in your head that knows what you’re doing is wrong, but it affects you to the point that you don’t know you’re doing it,” she told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Claire said it took years to connect these urges to her medication — and they disappeared almost immediately when she stopped taking it. She now feels “shame” and is “mortified” at the dangerous situations she put herself in.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the women told the BBC that their doctors failed to assess the impact of the medication on their bodies over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sarah, who began taking a different dopamine agonist in her 50s, said her previously low sex drive skyrocketed to the point where she became fully addicted. She started selling underwear and explicit videos online, organizing phone sex with strangers and compulsively shopping — racking up $30,000 in debt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To cope with the effects, she turned to self-medication, using pain-relieving opioids and sleeping pills. Ultimately, Sarah ended up in rehab, but that led to losing her driver’s license and her job.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I turned to things that weren’t healthy — I knew that the behavior wasn’t me, but I couldn’t control it,” she told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Impulsive behavior, including hypersexuality, is a potential side effect of dopamine agonists.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A class-action lawsuit was filed against GSK in 2011 by four Parkinson’s disease sufferers who claimed Ropinirole led to gambling debts and broken relationships. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also argued that despite studies linking the drug to such behaviors as early as 2000, GSK had failed to include warnings in its product literature until March 2007. The case was settled, but GSK denied liability.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In a statement, GSK told the BBC that Ropinirole had been prescribed for more than 17 million treatments and undergone “extensive clinical trials.” It added the drug had proven to be effective and had a “characterized safety profile.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As with all medicines, [it] has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to its 2003 research that had found a link with “deviant” sexual behavior, GSK told the BBC this was shared with health authorities and had informed updates in prescribing information — which now lists “altered or increased sexual interest” and “behavior of significant concern” as side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GSK did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

It can help relax your muscles and reduce cortisol.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Eric Berg, a chiropractor and nutrition influencer, has claimed that fluctuating magnesium levels are to blame. A deficiency in the nutrient, he warned, can heighten levels of the stress hormone cortisol triggering sudden night time waking and should be checked out by a doctor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'One last indication of magnesium deficiency is twitching, so if you're getting this twitch underneath your eye or your arm that's a sure sign that you are deficient in magnesium.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Magnesium controls calcium and when you don't have enough magnesium you get more calcium and the calcium just causes cramping in different areas of the body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Berg advised viewers with poor sleep to take a magnesium supplement before you go to bed at night.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But limited research has suggested magnesium may help benefit sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2022 review of studies, involving more than 7,000 participants, suggested there was 'an association between magnesium statuses and sleep quality'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, writing in the journal &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/"&gt;Springer Nature&lt;/a&gt; the researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iran/index.html" id="mol-f8bb77d0-fe7c-11ef-8766-39e8b747f9aa"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; said this was only found in observational studies, which could not fully establish cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By comparison, 'randomised clinical trials [gold-standard studies] showed an uncertain association between magnesium supplementation and sleep disorders', they added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Limited research has suggested magnesium may help benefit sleep. One 2022 review of studies, involving more than 7,000 participants, suggested there was 'an association between magnesium statuses and sleep quality'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-f8bb77d1-fe7c-11ef-8766-39e8b747f9aa"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; recommends women aged between 19 and 64 get 270mg of magnesium a day, while this increases to 300mg for men of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Supplements sold at the likes of Boots, Holland &amp;amp; Barratt and on supermarket shelves are often sold as 375mg tablets.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health service also says most people should get all the nutrients they need by having a varied and balanced diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have long advised that leafy green vegetables are a good source of magnesium because it is found in chlorophyll, which is the green pigment in plants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unrefined grains, nuts and seeds are also good sources, as well as some fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, 100g of spinach contains around 112mg of magnesium when boiled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almonds and cashews, meanwhile. contain around 270 and 250mg per 100g respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The NHS says most people should get all the nutrients they need by having a varied and balanced diet &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Poor sleep has been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer , stroke and infertility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the video, Dr Berg, who boasts more than 13.2 million &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/youtube/index.html" id="mol-4e217f80-fe7d-11ef-8766-39e8b747f9aa"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; subscribers, also claimed that low blood sugar levels may also be to blame for waking up in the night — as this increases cortisol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'If your diet is high in carbs, your blood sugar may decrease while sleeping, and your body will increase cortisol levels to normalise your blood sugar,' he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're waking up at 2am, consider what you ate the day before.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Eating late can disrupt sleep.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research also suggests chronic stress can raise levels of the hormones cortisol and adrenaline which impact sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But cortisol, while known as the stress hormone, also plays a much more complex role in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are receptors for the hormone on almost every part of your body, according to &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22187-cortisol"&gt;the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to check these signals, the team identified 85% of individuals who later developed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-night-of-lost-sleep-can-trigger-hidden-health-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thinking problems&lt;/a&gt; with an overall accuracy of 77%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts analyzed electroencephalography patterns that were recorded overnight. The AI analysis uncovered faint differences in electrical rhythms between those who later developed memory issues and those who did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After looking at the results, Dr. Shahab Haghayegh from &lt;a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt; emphasized how this technology could transform early detection efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using novel sophisticated analyses, advanced information theory tools, and AI, we can detect subtle changes in brain wave patterns during sleep that signal future cognitive impairment, offering a window of opportunity for intervention years before symptoms appear,” said Dr. Haghayegh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gamma-waves-reveal-memory-risks"&gt;Gamma waves reveal memory risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have been especially interested in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3084194/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gamma frequency bands&lt;/a&gt;, which range roughly between 30 to 60 hertz. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/gamma-wave" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gamma waves&lt;/a&gt; are linked to memory and attention, and changes in these ranges can signal trouble for brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruption in gamma signals has been &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-neuro-062111-150444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in people with emerging cognitive impairment, hinting that small shifts in the speed or coordination of these bursts might appear earlier than more obvious signs of forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also point out that many normal sleepers pass through several stages each night, and there might be red flags across multiple stages. Each category of sleep, including deep &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pupils-reveal-how-active-the-brain-is-even-during-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, carries particular brain-wave footprints that AI can analyze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-these-findings-matter"&gt;Why these findings matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and other types of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; remain a growing concern worldwide. This memory challenge affects more than 55 million people internationally, often leading to serious health burdens for families and communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are no guaranteed cures for many forms of dementia, some treatments may slow or reduce symptoms in earlier phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, scientists have been racing to find ways of predicting who might be at risk before significant thinking problems develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many approaches involve advanced scans or fluid tests that can be costly. Brain activity recordings offer a simpler strategy with comfortable EEG headbands that people can wear at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-potential-for-earlier-interventions"&gt;Potential for earlier interventions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep science has shown that deep rest is involved in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-helps-prevent-unwanted-memories-from-popping-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt; and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults frequently have changes in deep &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-timing-has-a-powerful-effect-on-our-mood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, but not all shifts spell trouble. The trick lies in spotting patterns that hint at future impairment, which is precisely what these new methods aim to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new, FDA-approved treatments for Alzheimer’s disease are effective at the earlier stages of dementia, but not the more advanced stages,” said Dr. Kun Hu, physiologist in the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-on-sleep-and-memory"&gt;Future research on sleep and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One vision for this research is wearable EEG devices that people might use on multiple nights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information collected over a week or more could yield deeper insights than a single test. Gathering more data might refine how precisely the system can spot troubling sleep signals before memory loss begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another angle could be looking at whether the brain’s electrical patterns can be safely adjusted overnight to maintain healthy thinking. The researchers suggest that carefully timed stimulation during sleep may eventually help nudge wave activity in beneficial ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach still requires proper clinical trials, but the possibilities have captured attention among those studying &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-sleep-patterns-affect-your-health-over-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-staying-alert-to-sleep-signals"&gt;Staying alert to sleep signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people hesitate to learn about their risk of cognitive impairment. However, early awareness can give families time to plan, or may prompt lifestyle changes that support brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle routines such as staying physically active, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleeping-less-than-seven-hours-high-blood-pressure-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;getting enough rest&lt;/a&gt;, and engaging in social and mental challenges have been linked to better outcomes in many aging studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single test should ever define a person’s health future. Even so, it’s encouraging to see how sleep-based measurements might one day fit into regular health checkups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these sleep signals can be reliably caught and confirmed, it would give individuals a better shot at staving off serious memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13872877251319742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also found the concentration of plastics in the body was seven to 30 times higher in the brain, compared to other organs like the liver or kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MNPs have also been linked to cell death, changes in the gut microbiome, formation of blood clots and increased risk of heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Responding to the study, a group of doctors offered ways to reduce to exposure to MNPs, including swapping out plastic containers when reheating food in the microwave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic levels were also found to be three to five times higher in people diagnosed with dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nicholas Fabiano, from the University of Ottawa's Department of Psychiatry and lead author of the commentary noted: 'The dramatic increase in brain microplastic concentrations over just eight years, from 2016 to 2024, is particularly alarming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This rise mirrors the exponential increase we're seeing in environmental microplastic levels.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brandon Luu, an Internal Medicine Resident at the University of Toronto, explained that heating food in plastic containers can cause the release of BPA and phthalates into the air which can then get absorbed by your food and infiltrate your body when eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BPA, short for bisphenol A, and phthalates are industrial chemicals that are sometimes added to plastics as part of the manufacturing process to make them more durable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Luu said in the Eureka journal paper: 'Heating food in plastic containers—especially in the microwave can release substantial amounts of microplastics and nanoplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Avoiding plastic food storage and using glass or stainless steel alternatives is a small but meaningful step in limiting exposure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heating plastics is one of the largest drivers of forever chemical exposure, and the Mayo Clinic warned forever chemicals found in plastics are released when the item is reheated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separately, University of Nebraska researchers found in a 2023 study that microwaving plastic containers releases billions of nanoplastics and millions of microplastics per every square centimeter of a plastic container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Nebraska team further discovered that embryotic kidney cells died two days after bring exposed to those particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate 2024 study from researchers in India found when food-grade plastics or food that had been in contact with the plastic are heated, BPA is released and leaches into the food item 'and is thereby consumed, making it a potential candidate for causing serious health hazards.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Brandon Luu, an Internal Medicine Resident at the University of Toronto, explained that heating food in plastic containers can cause the release of BPA and phthalates in the microwave air which can contaminate the food and enter your body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;BPA, short for bisphenol A, and phthalates are industrial chemicals that are sometimes added to plastics as part of the manufacturing process to make them more durable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another large driver of MNPs exposure is drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Luu noted switching from&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14460305/microplastics-brain-blamed-product-millions-experts-reduce-exposure.html"&gt; bottled to filtered tap water &lt;/a&gt;alone could reduce microplastic intake from 90,000 to 4,000 particles per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Bottled water alone can expose people to nearly as many microplastic particles annually as all ingested and inhaled sources combined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Switching to tap water could reduce this exposure by almost 90 percent, making it one of the simplest ways to cut down on microplastic intake.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, a world-leading fertility scientist also advised people to steer clear from using plastic containers in the microwave due to its&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14210243/World-leading-scientist-reason-never-microwave-plastic-fertility-andrew-huberman.html"&gt;

However, as popularity soared, so has research warning of potential hazards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2023 study found people who eat just two servings of meat per week are at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Harvard University research, which is based on data from over 200,000 people followed almost 40 years, found those who ate the most red meat had a 62 percent higher risk compared to those eating the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And research from Oxford University found higher consumption of red meat increased the risk of heart disease by 18 percent for each additional 50 grams eaten per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One particularity harrowing case even saw a man on a carnivore diet suffer cholesterol levels so high that the fatty substance began leaking out of his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have also warned that those who limit their diet to meat could be at increased risk of conditions like scurvy and even cancer due to the diet's lack of vitamin C and fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While doctors from the Indiana University School of Medicine recently warned the diet could lead to increased risk of agonizing kidney stones - stone-like lumps in the organ that form from excess waste products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, some experts dispute some of findings of studies about the dangers of eating too much meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They highlight much of research fails to distinguish between the impact of processed meat like sausages and burger patties and less processed cuts like steak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most experts advise adopting a balanced diet of healthy animal products like lean cuts of meat, dairy and eggs alongside plenty of fruit and vegetables and wholegrain carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:59:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNd0lCTXJEbTBQYlhxZmN6QV9PeUxoRmFlZXY5Y0VOVTQzMnN4c2NQR1g3NVhRWmY3Z1d5UkoxdzMyQ21DSm0tbUFCVTkzX2FqZDFxZDAySHdROExWd3dNcmpXUEM1SDVXTFRkcGV5SC1XQ01XZk5ENDVZdHExeElVb2p3dGgwSmZDdHRsYlQtX0dLbkFkdXlvT2ItUQ</guid></item><item><title>Firefighter Brain Tumors Linked to Flame Retardant - Newsmax</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxPenN2cFNIYU1iclROQ1RmYnJYNTE0UmxVcHcxd0VGRXNudWdIcEFBa3ozZzEzbUQzaVNoSVF3NC1xY3ZIOW9CYzlJbHZobmlRQS1OSW9Eb3JPanFfR0p1V29UYV8wV3N2S245NVlPNWROZ1RERGZmeVRWTHFLMmZITGlqbDhLR2h3cHI1YXpQemFzRUx0dnl0dHE2MlFwZ9IBowFBVV95cUxNUlJfelNnX1JsSGdJY0Y5NUxTaC1CbXpQY0duenFTampsOHIwTU50MHpLa2xxUnFUdFR1S0JZVldLSnFyelNFaXB4el9RTmFWM0UxZjJ3RDdpWFlkTkJTazJQV2JZOW1YWUpYc2ltQ2RObWFxN1dvUHM4bkJheHdlZC1fTUFxUDdtdmQzd0pPeko2VjJfc2VWZ2pFNzkwclpTNHpN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Firefighters might face a higher risk of brain &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/cancer/cancer-staging-and-grading-648001.html"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; caused by exposure to chemicals in fire extinguishers, a new small-scale study says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veteran firefighters appear to have a higher risk of brain tumors called gliomas, which can be caused by gene mutations linked to flame retardant chemicals called haloalkanes, researchers reported in a study published March 10 in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cncr.35732"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have highlighted a mutational pattern, or “signature” in gliomas linked to haloalkane exposure, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In these data, we confirm detection of this signature in a cohort of individuals likely highly exposed to haloalkanes, i.e., long-term firefighters,” a team led by senior researcher &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/elizabeth-claus/"&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Claus&lt;/a&gt;, director of medical research at the Yale University School of Public Health, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gliomas are the most common type of brain cancer, researchers said in background notes. About one-third of all brain tumors are gliomas, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers found 17 firefighters with gliomas participating in a University of California-San Francisco study of adults with this form of brain tumor. The firefighters had been on the job for an average of 22 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They compared the tumors of the firefighters with 18 other participants in the brain tumor study who worked in other fields. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As firefighters have exposure to such chemical agents, we examined mutational signatures in glioma brain tumors diagnosed in persons who worked as firefighters versus those who did not,” Claus said in a journal news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firefighters’ brain tumors were indeed more likely to carry the haloalkane-associated mutational signature, especially if they’d been firefighters for many years, researchers explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the non-firefighters, the haloalkane tumor signature was more likely in jobs that also could involve exposure to the chemical, such as car painting and machine maintenance, researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides preliminary data but will need confirmation in a larger data set and across a wider range of occupations,” Claus said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Identifying exposure to such mutational agents is important to inform public health intervention strategies and pinpoint occupational hazards that may be avoidable,” she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Using advanced imaging techniques, the study pinpointed neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that respond both to personal distress and observed distress in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists further demonstrated that signals from the ACC to the brain’s periaqueductal gray (PAG) region are crucial for transforming empathy into behavioral responses, like freezing or avoidance. Manipulating this ACC-to-PAG pathway directly affected empathic behaviors, confirming its vital role in translating observed pain into emotional reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings clarify the neural basis of empathy, which could inform treatments for conditions involving impaired emotional or social processing, such as autism, schizophrenia, or PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Neural Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons in the ACC activate similarly whether experiencing pain firsthand or observing another in pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy Circuit Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The ACC-to-PAG neural pathway specifically processes emotional responses to observed distress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Disrupting the ACC-to-PAG connection significantly reduces empathic behaviors, demonstrating its critical role.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy—the ability to share and understand the emotions of others—is a cornerstone of human social interactions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we witness someone in pain, we often experience a mirrored emotional response, a phenomenon known as affect sharing. While this ability is essential for social bonding and survival, the precise neural mechanisms behind empathy remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108105"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/affective-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This approach provides new insights into the fundamental neural mechanisms of affective empathy. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Dr. KEUM Sehoon at the Center for Cognition and Sociality (CCS) within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in South Korea has uncovered key insights into how the brain processes others’ distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using miniature endoscopic calcium imaging, the researchers identified specific neural ensembles in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that encode empathic freezing, a behavioral response in which an observer reacts with fear when witnessing distress in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this phenomenon, the team conducted a series of real-time brain imaging experiments in mice, tracking individual neurons as they observed another mouse experiencing mild foot shocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that specific ACC neurons were activated both when the observer experienced pain firsthand and when they witnessed another in pain, reinforcing the idea that observing distress triggers a neural response similar to direct pain experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study further revealed that ACC population activity during empathic freezing closely resembles the neural representation of affective—rather than sensory—aspects of direct pain experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that witnessing another’s pain triggers activation in the ACC as if the observer were experiencing pain themselves, highlighting the ACC’s specialized role in processing the emotional aspects of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed that ACC neurons projecting to the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a brain region involved in fear and pain regulation, selectively conveyed emotional pain information. The researchers used optogenetics, a technique that enables precise control of neural activity with light, to manipulate this pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they inhibited the ACC-to-PAG circuit, empathic freezing, and pain avoidance behaviors were significantly reduced. This confirms that this pathway transforms perceived distress into behavioral responses, reinforcing its crucial role in affective empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous studies that focused on animals with prior pain experience, this study used naïve observer mice with no previous exposure to pain, allowing the researchers to examine pure emotional contagion without the influence of past experiences. This approach provides new insights into the fundamental neural mechanisms of affective empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the brain encodes empathy could have major implications for mental health research. Conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), antisocial personality disorder, PTSD, and schizophrenia often involve difficulties in processing social and emotional cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying the specific brain circuits involved in affect sharing, scientists may develop new strategies for treating these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Keum stated, “Our findings pinpoint the specific brain circuits involved in processing others’ pain emotionally, offering a foundation for new approaches to studying empathy-related neuropsychiatric disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this empathy and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afd8c6c3c3c6dcdac7efc6cddc81ddca81c4dd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;William Suh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;William Suh – Institute for Basic Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57230-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cortical representations of affective pain shape empathic fear in male mice&lt;/a&gt;” by KEUM Sehoon et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortical representations of affective pain shape empathic fear in male mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affect sharing, the ability to vicariously feel others’ emotions, constitutes the primary component of empathy. However, the neural basis for encoding others’ distress and representing shared affective experiences remains poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, using miniature endoscopic calcium imaging, we identify distinct and dynamic neural ensembles in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that encode observational fear across both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, we discover that the population dynamics encoding vicarious freezing information are conserved in ACC pyramidal neurons and are specifically represented by affective, rather than sensory, responses to direct pain experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, using circuit-specific imaging and optogenetic manipulations, we demonstrate that distinct populations of ACC neurons projecting to the periaqueductal gray (PAG), but not to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), selectively convey affective pain information and regulate observational fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our findings highlight the critical role of ACC neural representations in shaping empathic freezing through the encoding of affective pain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:41:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBpOEhKTFRabTBzWUhCR2tXZ3owWW4xU3FGZFYwZzA3bUdCcUJKd2RiN1hBZGl5aThCVy1hRzNmSFhRekV2cDhhMWNVTi14aGdKVTlocXFaNWdrdi0tY1JTNjFyc2J2LThfZ3VXRjBweW5zTE11</guid></item><item><title>Giving blood linked to lower risk of pre-cancer gene -

Scientists discovered that these viral antibodies mistakenly target a protein called GlialCAM in the brain, triggering autoimmune responses associated with MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed how combinations of genetic risk factors and elevated viral antibodies further increase the risk of developing MS. These insights may pave the way for improved diagnostics and targeted therapies, enhancing our understanding of the genetic and immunological interplay underlying this debilitating disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistargeted Antibodies:&lt;/strong&gt; EBV antibodies mistakenly attack GlialCAM, a brain protein, potentially triggering MS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Links:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific combinations of EBV antibodies and genetic risk factors substantially elevate MS risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Diagnostics:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated antibodies against GlialCAM and related proteins could serve as biomarkers for early MS detection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In multiple sclerosis (MS), antibodies to the common Epstein-Barr virus can accidentally attack a protein in the brain and spinal cord. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research shows that the combination of certain viral antibodies and genetic risk factors can be linked to a greatly increased risk of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108101"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The absence of a protective gene variant (HLA-A*02:01) in combination with any of the antibodies against proteins in the brain was also associated with a strong increase in risk. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS &lt;/em&gt;and led by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, and Stanford University School of Medicine, USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 90 to 95 percent of adults are carriers of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and have formed antibodies against it. Many become infected as children with few or no symptoms, but in young adults, the virus can cause glandular fever. After infection, the virus remains in the body in a dormant (latent) phase without active virus production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attacking a protein in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone affected by the neurological disease MS, where the immune system attacks the brain and spinal cord, is a carrier of EBV. However, the mechanisms behind the association are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at Karolinska Institutet and Stanford Medicine have confirmed that antibodies to an EBV protein called EBNA1 can inadvertently react with a similar protein in the brain called GlialCAM, which probably contributes to the development of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new study also shows how different combinations of antibodies and genetic risk factors for MS contribute to the risk increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A better understanding of these mechanisms may ultimately lead to better diagnostic tools and treatments for MS,” says Tomas Olsson, professor of neurology at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, who led the research there with professor Ingrid Kockum and assistant professor Olivia Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed blood samples from 650 MS patients and 661 healthy people. They compared the levels of antibodies directed against the viral protein EBNA1 and the levels of misdirected antibodies against GlialCAM and two other proteins in the brain, ANO2 and CRYAB, which are also similar to EBNA1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased levels of antibodies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated levels of all these antibodies were detected in people with MS. High antibody levels in combination with a genetic risk factor for MS (HLA-DRB1*15:01) were associated with a further increase in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of a protective gene variant (HLA-A*02:01) in combination with any of the antibodies against proteins in the brain was also associated with a strong increase in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new findings provide another piece of the puzzle that adds to our understanding of how genetic and immunological factors interact in MS,” says Lawrence Steinman, professor of neurology at Stanford Medicine, who led the research there with William Robinson, professor of immunology and rheumatology, and Tobias Lanz, assistant professor of immunology and rheumatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomarker potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Karolinska Institutet now plan to analyse samples collected before MS disease development to see when these antibodies appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they are already present before the onset of the disease, they may have the potential to be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis,” says Tomas Olsson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Brain Foundation, the EU/Horizon Europe, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Margaretha af Ugglas Foundation, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomas Olsson and Lawrence Steinman have received lecture and advisory board fees from several companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Robinson and Tobias Lanz are stockholders and consultants of Ebvio and Flatiron Bio and have filed a patent with Stanford University.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this connection are only partially understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We previously described molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and three human CNS proteins: anoctamin-2 (ANO2), alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), and glial cellular adhesion molecule (GlialCAM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigated antibody responses against EBNA1 and GlialCAM in a large cohort of 650 MS patients and 661 matched population controls and compared them to responses against CRYAB and ANO2. We confirmed that elevated IgG responses against EBNA1 and all three CNS-mimic antigens associate with increased MS risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking experiments confirmed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM, and accompanying antibody responses against adjacent peptide regions of GlialCAM suggest epitope spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibody responses against EBNA1, GlialCAM, CRYAB, and ANO2 are elevated in MS patients carrying the main risk allele &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1*15:01,&lt;/em&gt; and combinations of &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1*15:01&lt;/em&gt; with anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies increase MS risk significantly and in an additive fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, antibody reactivities against more than one EBNA1 peptide and more than one CNS-mimic increase the MS risk significantly but modestly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, we show that molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM is likely an important molecular mechanism contributing to MS pathology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:06:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9hN3g5TFZpM1BGSzYzdk50MFlEdkZsUmJEekw3eWM4Z1lyWFJYNWVXdmVjUmJpZVJCMENSRE5KX3FPbXk1ODBBZC1ZaUdQZlNwNEg4RExJaEl6VlNMSzR3MTM3aG5ZVjduQUltT3A3WWVIZFhSbjdkVFBtVQ</guid></item><item><title>Microplastics may be creating antibiotic-resistance superbugs - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOamVISHJraVZwdGQ0T2RjMDZhQWU3dXAzS2d6RzFpWE9IaGF2blJWUWRLYXdHTzljeGw0LUw2c05FclhzVEZIWDZmemtwMEZ1M0tONDQ2SGpwVFBwem5HX3VLYm1Eb05PVE1WcE1xd1V2MFl6OXdmbEU0R2Nhd2xvUS1MOE56SzBERUttZnZManZaa3A5UnF5YlA3TlpHLVVv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Talk about a culture shock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/05/health/making-a-single-change-can-drastically-cut-microplastics-intake/"&gt;Microplastics&lt;/a&gt; — tiny particles that come from large plastic items and industrial waste — can damage cells and disrupt organs, potentially increasing the risk of heart disease, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/health/hidden-danger-can-cause-infertility-colon-cancer-lung-problems/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/23/health/plastic-found-in-testicles-and-blood-clots-sparking-health-concerns-studies/"&gt;infertility&lt;/a&gt; and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076095?" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Researchers from Boston University&lt;/a&gt; say there’s another downside to these ubiquitous shards — bacteria exposed to them can become resistant to several types of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Microplastics, like the ones pictured here, have been linked to several health concerns. Researchers from Boston University identified another downside to microplastics — bacteria exposed to them can become resistant to several types of antibiotics. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;gradt – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Researchers are particularly concerned about places where plastic litter piles up, like this temporary camp at Al-Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are believed to inhale and ingest &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tens of thousands of microplastic particles&lt;/a&gt; a year. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/health/spoonful-of-microplastics-found-in-peoples-brains-study/"&gt;One recent study found&lt;/a&gt; a spoonful of them in people’s brains because they are everywhere in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fact that there are microplastics all around us, and even more so in impoverished places where sanitation may be limited, is a striking part of this observation,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/muhammad-zaman-ph-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Muhammad Zaman&lt;/a&gt;, a Boston University professor of biomedical engineering who studies antimicrobial resistance and refugee and migrant health.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“There is certainly a concern that this could present a higher risk in communities that are disadvantaged,” Zaman continued, “and only underscores the need for more vigilance and a deeper insight into [microplastic and bacterial] interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance is quite common — &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-07-2023-vaccines-could-avert-half-a-million-deaths-associated-with-anti-microbial-resistance-a-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an estimated 4.95 million deaths&lt;/a&gt; occur each year worldwide due to these infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zaman blames the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/04/05/doctor-burnout-linked-to-overprescribing-opioids-antibiotics-study/"&gt;misuse and overuse of antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; as well as the immediate surroundings of the microbe, where bacteria and viruses replicate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Misuse and overuse of antibiotics, like the ones shown here, can lead to antimicrobial resistance. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;torjrtrx – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;His team studied how the common bacteria E. coli reacted in a closed environment with microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bacteria attached to and colonized the plastics, as they do to any surface, creating a slimy, complex coating called a biofilm. Biofilms protect bacteria from environmental stressors, antibiotics and immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biofilms on microplastics turned out to be stronger and thicker than those observed on other materials, like glass. The rate of antibiotic resistance on the microplastics was also much higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re demonstrating that the presence of plastics is doing a whole lot more than just providing a surface for the bacteria to stick — they are actually leading to the development of resistant organisms,” Zaman said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most plastics repel water and other liquids — they are hydrophobic due to their molecular structure.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Zaman’s team speculated that plastics eventually take in moisture and may absorb antibiotics before they reach the bacteria they are trying to target. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.02282-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Applied and Environmental Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;It’s unclear exactly why bacteria have such a strong hold on microplastics, like the ones shown here. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;MediaNews Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to discern the exact mechanisms that allow bacteria to have such a strong grip on plastic and study the occurrence of microplastic-related antibiotic-resistant bacteria and viruses in refugee camps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team noted that refugees, asylum seekers and forcibly displaced populations are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309924005784#:~:text=Refugees%20and%20asylum%20seekers%20are,to%20health%20and%20vaccine%20systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;particularly susceptible&lt;/a&gt; to drug-resistant infections. &lt;a href="https://www.unrefugees.org/refugee-facts/statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;An estimated 122 million&lt;/a&gt; people have been &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/20/study-war-climate-displaced-tens-of-millions-in-2020/"&gt;forcibly displaced worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Can you pass me the whatchamacallit? It's right over there next to the thingamajig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us will experience "lethologica", or difficulty finding words, in everyday life. And it usually becomes more prominent with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequent difficulty finding the right word can signal changes in the brain &lt;a href="https://www.geriatric.theclinics.com/article/S0749-0690(22)00058-1/abstract"&gt;consistent&lt;/a&gt; with the early ("preclinical") stages of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="154563" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease – before more obvious symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13825585.2024.2315774"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Toronto suggests that it's the speed of speech, rather than the difficulty in finding words that is a more accurate indicator of brain health in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers asked 125 healthy adults, aged 18 to 90, to describe a scene in detail. Recordings of these descriptions were subsequently analysed by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="154563" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI) software to extract features such as speed of talking, duration of pauses between words, and the variety of words used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed a standard set of tests that measure concentration, thinking speed, and the ability to plan and carry out tasks. Age-related decline in these "executive" abilities was closely linked to the pace of a person's everyday speech, suggesting a broader decline than just difficulty in finding the right word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145030" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642.jpg" alt="People sitting at a table " class="size-full wp-image-145030" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145030" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEJM9UZz3U/"&gt;Peopleimages/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel aspect of this study was the use of a "picture-word interference task", a clever task designed to separate the two steps of naming an object: finding the right word and instructing the mouth on how to say it out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this task, participants were shown pictures of everyday objects (such as a broom) while being played an audio clip of a word that is either related in meaning (such as "mop" – which makes it harder to think of the picture's name) or which sounds similar (such as "groom" – which can make it easier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study found that the natural speech speed of older adults was related to their quickness in naming pictures. This highlights that a general slowdown in processing might underlie broader cognitive and linguistic changes with age, rather than a specific challenge in memory retrieval for words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfLP8fFrOp0?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Alzheimer's explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to make the findings more powerful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings from this study are interesting, finding words in response to picture-based cues may not reflect the complexity of vocabulary in unconstrained everyday conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verbal fluency tasks, which require participants to generate as many words as possible from a given category (for example, animals or fruits) or starting with a specific letter within a time limit, may be used with picture-naming to better capture the "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon refers to the temporary inability to retrieve a word from memory, despite partial recall and the feeling that the word is known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tasks are considered a better test of everyday conversations than the picture-word interference task because they involve the active retrieval and production of words from one's vocabulary, similar to the processes involved in natural speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While verbal fluency performance does not significantly decline with normal ageing (as shown in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-022-02018-y"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt;), poor performance on these tasks can indicate neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests are useful because they account for the typical changes in word retrieval ability as people get older, allowing doctors to identify impairments beyond what is expected from normal ageing and potentially detect neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verbal fluency test engages various brain regions involved in language, memory, and executive functioning, and hence can offer insights into which regions of the brain are affected by cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the University of Toronto study could have investigated participants' subjective experiences of word-finding difficulties alongside objective measures like speech pauses. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive processes involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal reports of the "feeling" of struggling to retrieve words could offer valuable insights complementing the behavioural data, potentially leading to more powerful tools for quantifying and detecting early cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145024" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AlzheimersCognitiveDecline642.jpg" alt="Senior man looking forgetful" class="size-full wp-image-145024" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AlzheimersCognitiveDecline642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AlzheimersCognitiveDecline642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145024" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The verbal fluency test can offer insights into which regions of the brain are affected by cognitive decline.(&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADm4mcPaOE/"&gt;Motortion/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Opening doors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this study has opened exciting doors for future research, showing that it's not just what we say but how fast we say it that can reveal cognitive changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By harnessing natural language processing technologies (a type of AI), which use computational techniques to analyse and understand human language data, this work advances previous studies that noticed subtle changes in the spoken and written language of public figures like &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6922000/"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15574466/"&gt;Iris Murdoch&lt;/a&gt; in the years before their dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those opportunistic reports were based on looking back after a dementia diagnosis, this study provides a more systematic, data-driven and forward-looking approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using rapid advancements in natural language processing will allow for automatic, detection of language changes, such as slowed speech rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study underscores the potential of speech rate changes as a significant yet subtle marker of cognitive health that could aid in identifying people at risk before more severe symptoms become apparent.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/224812/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organic food can be more costly and less accessible than conventional food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organic food is thought to reduce your risk of cancer, but there is no research to support this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any fruits and vegetables are better than none—your overall diet matters most.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Picture the last time you were at the grocery store in the produce aisle... you started reaching for an organic tomato until the price tag stopped you in your tracks and you were left with an overwhelming choice: buy the organic one and deal with an ever-increasing bill at checkout or opt for conventional to save some money—but potentially add a side of pesticides to your salad. Picking out produce at the grocery store used to be a basic task you could do without overthinking too much. Now, choosing between organic and conventional foods has us putting a price tag on our health. And it doesn’t stop at the produce aisle. The decisions we have to make as consumers put us between a rock and a hard place: Do we pay more for an organic stamp and have peace of mind knowing that we’re doing our best to keep pesticides out of our bodies? Or do we go with conventional, saving money on food (which is increasingly expensive) but increasing our cancer risk in the process? Does it even matter? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s a valid question to have since cancer rates have been rising for many groups, especially in younger folks. Though more people are surviving cancer due to early detection and improved treatment, the American Cancer Society predicts more than two million new cancer diagnoses in 2025, marked by an increasing incidence in middle-aged and younger adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Add to that the pervasive messaging we see on TikTok and other social media platforms that pesticides in our food are to blame. So, it’s no surprise that consumers might wonder: should you go organic to lower your risk of cancer? Data shows that the popularity of buying organic has increased during the past decades, with organic fruits and vegetables bringing in $22 billion in sales in 2022.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While organic enjoys an image as a healthier type of food compared to its conventional counterparts, research hasn’t shown a clear answer on whether that translates into cancer protection, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-organics--the-use-of-pesticides"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Organics &amp;amp; The Use of Pesticides &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a food to be called “organic” in the US, it has to abide by a specific set of standards set by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even within the organic category, however, there are different labels:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100% Organic:&lt;/strong&gt; Made with all organic ingredients&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organic:&lt;/strong&gt; Made with at least 95 percent organic ingredients&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Made with Organic &lt;/strong&gt;[fill in the blank]: Contains at least 70 percent organic ingredients &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the USDA, organic food is produced without conventional pesticides, fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients or sewage sludge, bioengineering (genetically modified organism/GMO) or ionizing radiation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Meat, eggs and dairy that are organic are produced from animals without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, when it comes to crops that produce food like fruits and vegetables, the main difference is that organic is produced without the use of synthetic chemicals, says &lt;a href="https://cancercenter.arizona.edu/person/melanie-hingle-phd-mph-rdn" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Melanie Hingle, Ph.D., M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, associate director at the School of Nutritional Sciences and Wellness at The University of Arizona in Tucson. She says that organic farming may also rely on natural pest control methods (like releasing beneficial insects or planting nearby plants that attract pests), using natural soil enrichments instead of synthetic fertilizer, or weeding by hand.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But here’s the kicker—organic doesn’t necessarily mean pesticide-free. “Organic produce may contain pesticides. These are typically organic pesticides,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghan-garrity-ms-rd-cso-csowm-cnsc-cdn-3848145/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Meghan Garrity, M.S., RD, CSO&lt;/a&gt;, an oncology dietitian located in New York City. “You can lower pesticide exposure by eating organic, but not 100%. There’s a misconception that organic is completely ‘clean,’ but unfortunately that’s not the case,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that organic farmers are less likely to spray their fields with pesticides.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;However, when organic farmers use organic pesticides and conventional farmers use synthetic pesticides, organic and conventional farmers use them at a similar rate, though one main difference has been found: With pesticides that are considered to have “high acute human toxicity,” organic produce contains about one-quarter less of these products compared to conventional.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-pullquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic produce may contain pesticides. These are typically organic pesticides. You can lower pesticide exposure by eating organic, but not 100%. There’s a misconception that organic is completely ‘clean,’ but unfortunately, that’s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#icon-quote-open" href="#icon-quote-open"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-pullquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-pullquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, even if a specific chemical may be toxic, it’s the dose of exposure that makes a difference. That’s why the EPA has rules on how much pesticide can be used. “They set this limit with a large margin away from a dose that has been shown to potentially cause harm. These limits are on how much is allowed to be used, as well as limits on how much can still remain on food,” says &lt;a href="https://cancernutritionhq.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Krystle Zuniga, Ph.D., RD, CSO&lt;/a&gt;, an oncology nutritionist in Austin, Texas. She points to a 2024 USDA report that found that more than 99% of the nearly 10,000 foods tested (which included fresh and processed fruits, vegetables and nuts) had pesticide residues below the EPA-established levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s important to note that limits are set for each food, taking into consideration children’s safety.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, these chemicals might remain in your body once you consume them. In one small trial (of just 27 people), researchers randomized one group of adults to eat a Mediterranean diet made of only organic foods, while the other group ate a Mediterranean diet made of conventional foods for two weeks. The organic group wound up with 91% lower levels of synthetic pesticide residue in their urine than the conventional group.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-research-says-about-organic-food-and-cancer-risk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Research Says About Organic Food and Cancer Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Garrity notes that lowering exposure to these pesticides doesn’t automatically translate into an outcome like cancer prevention. More research is needed to see if exposure below recommended limits confers a real benefit. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several studies have tried to answer this question with mixed results. One recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that the overall and specific cancer-type risk (breast, colorectal, non-Hodgkin lymphoma) were not associated with how frequently someone ate organic foods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other hand, a review of observational studies has found that eating organic (no specific amount is noted) may be tied to multiple health benefits, including reduced incidence of metabolic syndrome, high BMI and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. That said, the researchers point out that it’s not clear if eating organic food is the benefit per se (or the reduced exposure to synthetic chemicals). Also, people who eat organic food tend to have more nutritious diets and manage their weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, an earlier study published in 2018 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine &lt;/em&gt;concluded that following an organic diet may be associated with a 25% lower risk of certain cancers, such as postmenopausal breast cancer and lymphomas.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consuming a sustainable diet (one that has a low environmental impact), of which organic is one element, was also found to be associated with a small benefit to cancer risk, according to another review.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, why is there so much conflicting data? “This speaks to the challenges we have in studying nutrition in general,” says Hingle. “It’s very difficult to isolate the relationship between food exposure and a health outcome because there are many other things that can contribute to health and disease like cancer,” she says, adding that cancer is something that often develops over one’s lifetime, and more long-term studies are needed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s more, consumers who tend to buy organic food are more likely to be health-conscious and physically active, which makes it hard to tease out which of these factors contributes to a lower risk of chronic diseases, including cancer, says &lt;a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/greenlee-heather.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Heather Greenlee, ND, Ph.D., M.P.H&lt;/a&gt;., professor in the Cancer Prevention Program and director at the &lt;a href="https://www.cookforyourlife.org/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cook for Your Life&lt;/a&gt; program at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center.16 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-pullquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not want people to feel like if they can’t afford to buy organic, they should avoid produce altogether. That is not how we reduce our risk for cancer. At this point, we know that consuming a diet rich in plant foods is one of the best things you can do to reduce your risk of cancer, whether that’s organic or conventional&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;svg class="icon icon-quote-open theme-pullquote__icon"&gt;

&lt;p id="theme-pullquote__author_2-0" class="comp theme-pullquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, the unfortunate news is that there’s no clear answer on whether we need to purchase organic to protect ourselves against the risk of these diseases or not. “Our evidence is too limited to say definitively whether eating organic can lower your risk of cancer,” says Greenlee. That said, we &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;know something very powerful: “Strong evidence has demonstrated a connection between a lower risk of cancer and following eating patterns that are high in unprocessed or minimally processed (whole) plant foods, healthy oils, and lean poultry and fish, as well as limited added sugars and saturated fats,” she says. This includes whether you purchase conventional or organic.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is no denying that organic food is more expensive, and it may not be in everyone’s budget to buy all, some, or any organic. Focusing on pesticides is an important conversation—it’s one we need to have—but it’s easy to let this influence your shopping habits in negative ways. “We do not want people to feel like if they can’t afford to buy organic, they should avoid produce altogether. That is not how we reduce our risk for cancer. At this point, we know that consuming a diet rich in plant foods is one of the best things you can do to reduce your risk of cancer, whether that’s organic or conventional,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsey-wohlford-ms-rd-ld-00b09aa0/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lindsey Wohlford, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a wellness dietitian at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. This is good news because it makes a cancer-prevention diet accessible to more people.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-eating-tips-to-lower-your-risk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Eating Tips to Lower Your Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you feel more confused than ever, we have nutrition tips you can be confident in. “When talking about eating to prevent cancer, there are things you can do. But I should say that there are no guarantees—even for the world’s most perfect diet,” says Wohlford. Here’s where to start:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a plant-based diet: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim to consume a diet rich in plant-based foods. These foods are packed with fiber, which supports the health of your microbiome (and gut health may play a role in cancer development), provide antioxidants and other plant compounds that counter damage to cells, and are high in vitamins and minerals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more fruits and vegetables: &lt;/strong&gt;Speaking of plants, just one in 10 Americans meet the recommended intake of fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are a cornerstone of a cancer-prevention diet, and this is true whether you choose to buy organic or conventional.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit your intake of some foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Those include red and processed meats, added sugar, ultra-processed foods and alcohol, says Wohlford. Ultra-processed organic foods, like cookies or snack mixes, are still ultra-processed foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a variety: &lt;/strong&gt;“Different pesticides are used for apples versus berries, for instance. If you’re only consuming strawberries, you expose yourself more frequently to pesticides used to farm strawberries,” Zuniga says. Consuming a variety of fruits and veggies in your diet will lead to smaller levels of exposure to different pesticides.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wash your produce: &lt;/strong&gt;Washing, peeling and cooking can reduce pesticide residue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though, keep in mind that some of the pesticides are within the fruit or vegetables since they’re present in the soil, says Zuniga.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose organic sometimes, if you’d like: &lt;/strong&gt;Buy organic when it's at a lower cost or similar in price. Sometimes, buying organic frozen foods can offer price savings. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the big picture: &lt;/strong&gt;“While diet plays a crucial role, it’s one piece of the puzzle. Other major lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, exercise and maintaining a healthy weight, are all related to cancer,” says Hingle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Organic versus conventional foods differ in many ways, one of which is the use of pesticides. Organic food cannot be grown using synthetic pesticides, though that does not mean they’re pesticide-free. Although there is evidence of less pesticide residue in the urine after eating an organic diet, it’s unclear whether that directly translates to a lower risk of cancer. What’s more, the evidence also isn’t certain that an organic diet will offer more protection against cancer compared to one containing conventional food. In fact, when it comes to cancer prevention, research shows that your overall diet is what’s most important. Whether you choose organic or not, any fruits and vegetables are better than none. So keep putting those tomatoes in your shopping cart.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For example, even the CDC leaves some leeway on certain vaccines,” said Doron, including one for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7332e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7332e1.htm"&gt;Respiratory Syncytial Virus&lt;/a&gt;, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends for everyone 75 and older but for only some adults ages 60 to 74. “But because [measles] is so contagious — it’s the most contagious virus that we know — you have to have a very high rate of vaccination in your community.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Measles, best known for the signature red rash it causes, infects 9 out of every 10 unvaccinated people exposed to it. But it is also highly preventable. Two doses of the MMR vaccine — the first typically given when children are between the ages of 12 and 15 months and the second given between the ages of 4 and 6 years old— are 97 percent effective at preventing infection and provide lifelong immunity for most people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Herd immunity for measles requires a 95 percent vaccination rate, yet in the Texas county where measles has been spreading, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/health/measles-texas-new-mexico.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/health/measles-texas-new-mexico.html"&gt;roughly 82 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the kindergarten population had received the measles vaccine. Nationally, US MMR coverage among kindergarteners has fallen below the 95 percent threshold and is decreasing, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_1-measles-cases-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_1-measles-cases-in-2024"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h2 id="%22studies_have_found_that_vitamin_a_can" class="heading | font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile margin_bottom

In the United States — where fewer than 1 percent of the population is vitamin A deficient—there is no clinical proof that giving vitamin A to children reduces mortality or the illness’s severity, experts said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’ve never done a trial in the U.S., so I can’t tell you for certain whether it’s beneficial or it’s not,” said Dr. Alfred Sommer, a professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a contributor to a 2020 report by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases that &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Call-to-Action-Vitamin-A-for-the-Management-of-Measles-in-the-US-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.nfid.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Call-to-Action-Vitamin-A-for-the-Management-of-Measles-in-the-US-FINAL.pdf"&gt;urged further research into vitamin A treatment for measles in the U.S&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics notes that “many US experts concur with administering vitamin A to all children in the United States with measles, regardless of hospitalization status” and adds that &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/book/755/chapter/14079321/Measles?_gl=1*yqz2um*_ga*MTQ3MjMwOTg3Ni4xNzQxMTg5ODMw*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*MTc0MTU1Nzc3NS4xLjAuMTc0MTU1Nzc3NS4wLjAuMA..*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*MTc0MTU1Nzc3NS4zLjAuMTc0MTU1Nzc3NS4wLjAuMA..?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/book/755/chapter/14079321/Measles?_gl=1*yqz2um*_ga*MTQ3MjMwOTg3Ni4xNzQxMTg5ODMw*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*MTc0MTU1Nzc3NS4xLjAuMTc0MTU1Nzc3NS4wLjAuMA..*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*MTc0MTU1Nzc3NS4zLjAuMTc0MTU1Nzc3NS4wLjAuMA..?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;children with more severe measles&lt;/a&gt; may have lower vitamin A concentrations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;However, vitamin A, unlike vaccination, cannot prevent measles. It’s also important for parents to consult doctors before giving children vitamin A, because it’s possible to overdose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; In a recent Fox News interview, Kennedy also claimed that children with measles in Texas were being given cod liver oil, which is naturally high in vitamin A.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Doron expressed confusion over Kennedy’s claims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You would not administer vitamin A that way,” she said. “It doesn’t have even close to what you would give if you were administering medical-grade vitamin A.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Vitamin A — along with vitamin supplementation in general — has long been promoted by anti-vaccine activists as an alternative to vaccination for disease prevention, including by the anti-vaccine organization Children’s Health Defense, which Kennedy &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;founded and formerly chaired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h2 id="%22if_you_are_healthy_it's_almost_impossible" class="heading | font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile margin_bottom
            "&gt;“If you are healthy it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease in modern times.”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy made this claim in an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/vitamin-measles-treatment-rfk-jr-comments-spark-discussion-benefits-risks" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.foxnews.com/health/vitamin-measles-treatment-rfk-jr-comments-spark-discussion-benefits-risks"&gt;interview with Fox News&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Of course, a balanced diet is very important for health, but a nutrition rich diet alone will not stop the most contagious disease in the world from infecting an unvaccinated child,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota last week on his &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/episode-178-mixed-messages-navigating-unfolding-confusion" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/episode-178-mixed-messages-navigating-unfolding-confusion"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Doron echoed his comments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“People should absolutely pay attention to their underlying health, including exercise, a healthy diet, stress management, smoking cessation, and optimizing chronic diseases like diabetes with medications,” she said. “Doing so will boost the immune system and reduce the risk of complications. However, even healthy people contract infectious diseases, have complications, and die.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h2 id="%22by_1960_before_the_vaccine's_introduction" class="heading | font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile margin_bottom
            "&gt;“By 1960 — before the vaccine’s introduction — improvements in sanitation and nutrition had eliminated 98 percent of measles deaths." &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Doron criticized Kennedy’s historical framing of measles mortality. “It’s not percentages that we should care about, it’s absolute numbers,” she said. “We were seeing 400 to 500 deaths a year [prior to the introduction of vaccination], on top of that permanent disability in children due to measles.” Long-term effects of measles can include deafness, lung scarring, and sometimes fatal brain damage, Doron added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“MMR vaccines and other vaccines are safe,“ said Dr. Vandana Madhavan, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Mass General for Children. ”Unfortunately, that does not get the same amount of media attention as anti-vaccine misinformation, which has led to a greater rate of vaccine hesitancy,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If vaccine skepticism continues to spread, we’re going to see more outbreaks of diseases that had become rare in the U.S.,” Madhavan added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

              Welcome to Paging Dr. Gupta! This is the podcast where I get to answer your health questions, which I love doing. You've been sending in some really great questions, so there's a lot to get to today. And Kyra, who you're getting to know, one of our producers, she's back with me. Kyra, what do we have first?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Hey, Sanjay. Glad to be back! So, our first question today is coming from Mark in New York City. He's in his 50s and wants to know: how do I avoid pneumonia?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:33
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'All right. Mark, great question. Pneumonia has been in the news quite a bit lately and it can be a serious threat, especially as we get older. In fact, nearly a million older adults are hospitalized with pneumonia every year, and over a third of them will die within a year. So, pneumonia can start to be this trajectory towards a pretty serious illness. While older adults are the ones that we typically think about facing the highest risk, it can also be severe for young children, for immunocompromised individuals, and those with serious health conditions. Now, there's good news here in that there's a lot you can do to lower your risk. There are vaccines for pneumonia specifically, typically for children, and then at age 50, with a possible booster at age 65. Getting the flu shot, that can help prevent infections that can lead to pneumonia. And if you're eligible, there's also the RSV vaccine, this can offer some extra protection. The CDC recommends it for adults 75 and older, and those who are 60 to 74 who are considered higher risk. So pneumonia, just keep in mind it's an infection of the lungs. There's the upper respiratory tract. There's the lower respiratory tract. Upper respiratory tract is going to be more in your throat in your nose. Lower respiratory tract is pneumonia. Now people can have bronchitis, that's typically an inflammation of the airways inside your lungs. But pneumonia is an actual infection. Typically, it's a bacterial infection actually caused by something known as streptococcus. Now, you can take antibiotics for that. You take antibiotics for bacterial infections. But there can also be viral pneumonias which would not respond to antibiotics. But about 60 to 70% of pneumonias are actually caused by bacteria, so the vast majority are going to be caused by bacteria. They can be diagnosed with the physical exam and a chest x-ray. You may have also heard Mark, I'll mention, walking pneumonia. Walking pneumonia is kind of what it sounds like, it's a pneumonia where you can still be up walking around, so it's less severe and oftentimes it is also diagnosed by physical exam and a chest x-ray. Interestingly, with a standard pneumonia it typically affects one area of the lung, so one of the lobes of the lung. With the walking pneumonia, even though it is less severe in terms of symptoms, it does tend to affect all of the lungs, all the lobes of the lungs. But with walking pneumonia, you typically don't need to take antibiotics, you can typically treat that with over-the-counter medications. There are things that increase your risk and you should cut back on those things. Smoking is an obvious one. Heavy drinking that can weaken your immune system make you more vulnerable. And as I will talk about on this podcast all the time, supporting your immune system. Your immune system is constantly fighting off pathogens, it's doing it right now, probably as you're listening to this podcast. You want to make sure your immune system is as strong as possible. Lots of fruits and veggies and whole foods. Regular exercise, that helps release a lot of those pathogen fighting components in your blood. Even just brisk walking can go a long way. Prioritize good sleep. Your body needs that energy to be able to fight off infections. And you know, when you think about pneumonia, you think about respiratory infections. The way that they spread is by coughing and sneezing and putting those respiratory droplets into the air. Someone else can breathe those in, so you may want to protect yourself, especially if you're around sick people by wearing a high filtration mask. Those droplets can also get on surfaces, and people may touch those surfaces and then touch their eyes, their nose, or their mouth. So make sure surfaces are clean. Make sure your hands are clean. Avoid people who are obviously sick. Be mindful of spending time in high risk settings where you think a lot of viruses are going to go around. So Mark, that's basically it, you can do a lot of things to try and prevent or at least reduce your risk of getting pneumonia. And you're already on the right track, just for asking.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes it is. We have Casey here, who called in for her question from San Diego, California. Take a listen.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Hi Sanjay, it's Casey, and I was going to suggest some future topics that are of interest to me. Ah mostly for selfish reasons, I'm not going to lie, but one was about people who are night owls...that's me! And how their brains are different. I was listening to Abby Phillip and she was talking about being a night owl, and you know, having to deal with being perceived as being lazy by everybody. So I just thought that was interesting because I suffer that same characterization by people. So, thank you for your time. Bye.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              Okay really interesting, Casey, thanks for calling in! First of all, I just want to say that I know Abby Phillip,  I know her well. She's a colleague. She's a friend. She is not lazy. She works really hard. You have no idea how hard it is to anchor some of these shows, and the amount of work you got to do to make them as good as she does on a regular basis. Let me start off by saying this being a night out isn't simply a matter of preference or being lazy. In many ways, it is biological, I mean, nothing is entirely biological. There's always a nature and nurture component to just about everything, but there is a big sort of biological component to what is known as your sleep chronotype. Whether you naturally wake up early or whether you stay up late is largely driven by your own circadian rhythm. Your circadian rhythm. Think of that as your internal clock that regulates all sorts of functions. Sleep, yes, but also digestion and your body temperature and your mood. The reasons people like to eat at certain times, there are reasons they may feel cold or colder at certain times of the day, and why they may feel a little bit more anxious or energetic at certain times of the day. And obviously again, sleep when you may feel tired or more awake at certain times of the day. All of that has to do with your circadian rhythms. If you want to describe it even further for night owls, Melatonin, which is the hormone of darkness, the hormone of sleep. Melatonin, something that people will take to help fall asleep. You naturally produce this, but for night owls, that production starts later and that makes it natural to be more alert at night and to sleep in later in the morning. Now, I'm the opposite. I'm an early bird. I've always been an early bird. I think it's one of those things that probably helped me get through a pretty brutal seven years of neurosurgical residency. I was getting up at 5:00 in the morning to make rounds on time, but I was really good at that time of day. I spring out of bed first thing in the morning. My wife, incidentally, is a night owl. So that makes for an interesting marriage. I think it actually works, especially when our kids were young, because I'd get up early with them, she'd stay up late with them. Yeah, it's a whole thing. Now, there is some research to prove, for you Casey, that night owls have some advantages. There was a study from Imperial College which found that night owls actually scored, on average, higher on cognitive tests than early risers. I was surprised to read this study, you know, being an early morning person myself. But they actually studied over 26,000 people and they categorize them by this chronotype that I'm talking about morning person, night owl, or somewhere in between. But the findings, I think they helped challenge the stereotype that you're raising about early risers versus night owls being more productive or successful. Now, there are some downsides, as there are for most things in life. Other studies have shown that night owls are at higher risk for chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, even depression. But what they find when they dig into that a little bit more deeply is that that is often tied to lifestyle choices that go along with being a night owl. What are you doing when you're staying up late? Doomscrolling on your phone, probably skipping breakfast the next day, and you might have more irregular sleep. And that just throws off your internal clock. But if being a night owl worries you, there are some things you can do to help flip your body switch from night to day, at least a little bit. Again, there's a nature nurture component to everything. First of all, as soon as your alarm goes off in the morning, turn on the light and try and get as much natural light as possible. I always say open your shades before you look at your phone, just get that natural light into your eyes that kind of helps reset your internal clock. Makes waking up earlier easier. Next, stop eating at least three hours before bed and if you regularly exercise, which you should, try and do it earlier in the day. Also those screens, I mean those screens have really changed how we sleep overall as a world, not just a country. Turn off the screen earlier. This allows your body to start producing melatonin, the hormone of darkness, that helps you wind down. If you are still awake, try replacing the screen time with reading or even meditation. I've started doing yoga nidra. If you don't know what that is, look it up. It can be very, very relaxing. Whatever helps you relax, do something like that. Bottom line Casey, you are not lazy, neither is Abby Phillip. Your body just works differently. Focus on getting enough quality sleep and finding a routine that works for you.

Here are some answers to common questions about the disease, from how it presents to the durability of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is measles and why are we hearing about it now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The World Health Organization identifies measles as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-measles-vaccination"&gt;one of the most contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt;, killing up to three out of every thousand children globally. The disease has been preventable since 1963, when American researchers developed a vaccine. In 2000, measles was considered eliminated in the U.S., though occasional cases and outbreaks impacted mostly unvaccinated people. Currently, there are outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 6, an unvaccinated man in New Mexico &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188"&gt;died of measles.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;An unvaccinated school-aged child in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; died of the virus last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola"&gt;The Texas state health department reports that 90% of non-immune people become infected&lt;/a&gt; just by being near someone with the airborne sickness. The rubeola virus that causes measles can linger in midair for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the symptoms of measles and when do they appear?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says that measles symptoms — fevers of 104 degrees Fahrenheit or above, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes — appear within 14 days after an infection. Next come tiny white “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html"&gt;Koplik spots&lt;/a&gt;” on the inside of the mouth, and a rash that starts at the hairline and spreads down the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical complications can include pneumonia, deafness, blindness, encephalitis (brain swelling) and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/measles-vaccines#:~:text=Evidence%20was%20provided%20that%20the%20true%20incidence,000%20cases%20of%20measles%20has%20been%20cited."&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, a progressive neurological disease. Children 5 and under, adults over 20, pregnant women, and immunocompromised people such as chemotherapy patients and those living with leukemia or HIV are most vulnerable to complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the vaccine requirements?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Federal requirements for Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) shots don’t exist, but &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/official-guidance/state-policies/vaccine-requirements/mmr-child-school-2024/"&gt;all 50 states enforce some form of measles inoculation&lt;/a&gt; for children before they enter childcare or public schools. Some states, such as &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/school/exemptions"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, allow vaccination exemptions for religious and personal beliefs. California had a similar exemption until &lt;a href="https://eziz.org/assets/docs/shotsforschool/PBEFAQs.pdf"&gt;it was eliminated in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CDC-recommended measles vaccination includes two shots delivered at 12-15 months and 4-6 years of age. Together, the doses are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html"&gt;97% effective&lt;/a&gt; against measles infections. By contrast, unvaccinated people represent about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;94% of the 222 measles cases in the U.S. this year,&lt;/a&gt; and one in five unvaccinated people with measles requires hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these statistics have not deterred &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/01/as-texas-outbreak-grows-californias-measles-vaccination-rate-struggles-to-recover-after-pandemic/"&gt;a persistent anti-vaccination movement&lt;/a&gt; that expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lawmakers in &lt;a href="https://texansforvaccinechoice.com/89th-session-bill-list/"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/state-lawmakers-see-new-opportunities-to-pass-vaccine-exemptions-after-trumps-return"&gt;numerous other states&lt;/a&gt; continue pushing bills to dislodge routine vaccination from public health policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A February meeting of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html"&gt;CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt; has been indefinitely postponed and U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is stoking skepticism and confusion around vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; If I got vaccinated as recommended, am I OK? Isn’t the MMR vaccine good for life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; MMR vaccinations or natural immunity after a measles infection theoretically lasts a lifetime, according to Dr. Monica Gandhi an infectious disease doctor at UC San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gandhi said there has been no way to test this in the absence of the disease. “We haven’t put an 80-year-old in the situation where they’re in the middle of an outbreak in 2025,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Should older vaccinated adults, and those born before 1957 and presumed immune from the widespread infections of the pre-vaccination era, get another MMR vaccine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Gandhi said those vaccinated decades ago should consider a measles booster if they live near an outbreak, are 65 or older, or are preparing to travel internationally, especially for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yale School of Medicine recommends that at-risk &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/should-you-get-a-measles-vaccine-booster"&gt;people vaccinated prior to 1968&lt;/a&gt; (57 or older) might also want a new shot, because they received doses that are less effective than vaccines that became the standard after that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Should people who work in childcare or early education get boosters?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;This depends on local risk levels, Gandhi said. Vaccination rates at &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/164304"&gt;more kindergartens&lt;/a&gt; have been dipping below the 95% level previously recommended (and in California, currently enforced) for herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Can children be vaccinated ahead of schedule, and can the gap between the two doses be shorter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; In the event of an outbreak, Gandhi said, the first dose can be given to infants under a year old. They must be re-vaccinated on or after their first birthdays with two more doses of MMR vaccine separated by 28 days or more, or two more doses of the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine separated by 3 months or more. The CDC has &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/family/vaccine-recommendations-for-infants-and-children#:~:text=Children%20traveling%20abroad%20need%20to,for%20children%2012%E2%80%9347%20months."&gt;additional guidance for infants traveling internationally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there anyone for whom vaccination is unsafe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Severely immunocompromised people and pregnant women should not receive the live vaccine, Gandhi said. If exposed to measles, this population receives &lt;a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/antibodies/antibodies-learning-center/antibodies-resource-library/antibody-methods/introduction-immunoglobulins.html"&gt;immunoglobulins — protein antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that help the immune system fight off harmful agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation/index.html"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; has been touting vitamin A and cod liver oil as alternatives to combating measles. Scientists have debunked these suggestions, but is there any credence to claims that vitamin A or other nutrients can help reduce susceptibility to severe measles?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; “I really want to downplay vitamin A as a treatment. Prevention by vaccination is the best way to combat severe measles,” Gandhi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two deaths in this country over the last month are a very big deal for a preventable infectious disease,” she said. “It’s a very big deal to lose someone in your family — it’s a lifelong tragedy. There’s simply no reason not to get the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;

Four in five Americans &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; at least one dose; when we remember less than half of Americans get their flu shot each year, the high uptake of mRNA shots, at least initially, signaled a willingness from the US public to trust this novel technology. After most Americans received their shots, more people returned to work, more kids went back to school, and the economy began to rebound. And there was optimism that mRNA technology could be used to &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/can-mrna-vaccines-fight-pancreatic-cancer-msk-clinical-researchers-are-trying-find-out"&gt;make better vaccines for other diseases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But even as the vaccines were actively pulling the US out of the pandemic, skepticism about mRNA technology was rising. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., still a private citizen at the time and one of the country’s most vocal vaccine skeptics, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html"&gt;urged&lt;/a&gt; the first Trump administration to pull the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now the nation’s top health official, Kennedy is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/trump-team-weighs-pulling-funding-for-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine?embedded-checkout=true"&gt;reevaluating the US Health and Human Services’s contract&lt;/a&gt; with Moderna, which is developing flu vaccines targeting strains with high pandemic potential including the H5N1 bird flu that is currently &lt;a href="/explainers/399776/auto-draft"&gt;driving fears of another pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With Kennedy at the helm of HHS, scientists and public health experts worry that a major breakthrough in medicine development may now backslide. mRNA technology has shown the potential to deliver &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10611059/"&gt;new cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/clinical-trial-mrna-universal-influenza-vaccine-candidate-begins"&gt;a universal flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, and could lead scientists to uncover even more applications. But now, mRNA vaccine development is in peril — just a few years after proving its value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="why-so-many-americans-turned-against-a-vaccine-miracle" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Why so many Americans turned against a vaccine miracle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientists had been trying since the 1990s to crack mRNA vaccines, but &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/"&gt;progress was slow&lt;/a&gt;, in part because it was difficult to secure funding. But when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Operation Warp Speed funded rapid clinical trials, expanded manufacturing capabilities, and offered huge purchase guarantees for companies that delivered an effective vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;President Donald Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US’s top infectious disease research group.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;mRNA vaccine development proved almost &lt;em&gt;too good to be true&lt;/em&gt; during a real-life emergency. During the new Covid vaccines’ early clinical trials, they showed &lt;a href="/21556359/pfizer-vaccine-covid-19-biontech-trial-results-coronavirus"&gt;a 90 percent efficacy&lt;/a&gt; in preventing any symptoms at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the real world, the efficacy of early vaccines didn’t quite live up to that hype. The Moderna and Pfizer shots were still very effective in preventing severe disease, but some vaccinated people did get infected. Many people &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8825448/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; experiencing unpleasant side effects like fatigue or body aches after their shot; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9282130/"&gt;some of them&lt;/a&gt; felt ill enough to miss work. And as more variants of the disease emerged and as protection that many people got from the vaccines faded over time, shots became less and less effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For such purely biological reasons, there were some important caveats to the “miracle” that public health experts were touting. But those side effects fed into existing anti-vaccine sentiment, and many people — activated by &lt;a href="https://ucrmagazinearchive.ucr.edu/spring-2021-carpiano"&gt;influencers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/policy/23682263/ron-desantis-covid-19-vaccines-joseph-ladapo"&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt; who portrayed business closures and mask requirements as authoritarian measures of control — began to turn against the Covid vaccines. By autumn 2021, less than a year after the vaccines’ debut, anti-vaccine communities &lt;a href="/coronavirus-covid19/22686147/covid-19-vaccine-betadine-hydroxychloroquine-ivermectin-trump-conspiracy"&gt;were thriving&lt;/a&gt;, constructing an alternative narrative of the pandemic in which the disease itself was not actually that serious but the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/54893437"&gt;could alter your DNA or plant a chip in your body&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Public embrace for the vaccine shattered and never recovered. Data from the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/us-covid-shot-rates-are-low-and-it-will-be-a-challenge-to-boost-them.html"&gt;speaks for itself&lt;/a&gt;: Uptake for the booster shots that succeeded the original mRNA shots has plummeted; in November 2023, only 15 percent of Americans received the latest version of the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The low rates for Covid-19 boosters underscored growing misinformation: Four in 10 Republicans &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a January 2025 KFF poll that it was “probably” or “definitely” true that more people had died from the Covid-19 &lt;em&gt;vaccines&lt;/em&gt; than from Covid-19 itself, which represented a 15-point increase from a July 2023 survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Shifts in the national political mood have only entrenched this skepticism further. In December 2021, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/dec/10/robert-f-kennedy-jr/no-covid-19-vaccine-not-deadliest-vaccine-ever-mad/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the Covid shots were “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” (Scientists have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8875435/"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; at most a few dozen deaths attributable to the vaccines worldwide after billions of doses were administered, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10073592/"&gt;population-level analyses&lt;/a&gt; have detected &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7314a5.htm"&gt;no meaningful increase in mortality&lt;/a&gt; after the vaccines were introduced.) By February 2025, Vice President JD Vance was echoing some of those claims. “I took the vax, and, you know, I haven’t been boosted or anything,” Vance &lt;a href="https://x.com/newstart_2024/status/1891963200570118613"&gt;told podcaster&lt;/a&gt; Joe Rogan. “But the moment where I really started to get red-pilled on the whole vax thing was when the sickest that I have been in the last 15 years by far was when I took the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Elon Musk, meanwhile, has emerged as something of a double agent, simultaneously embracing skepticism of the Covid-19 vaccine development while underscoring the risk of discrediting mRNA technology entirely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1892159795974537345"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; on his own platform X that he “almost went to hospital” after a Covid booster, before adding: “That said, synthetic mRNA has a lot of potential to cure cancer and other diseases. Research should continue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He’s right. As Covid-19 has upended our politics and culture so thoroughly in the past five years, we are at risk of losing out on important medical innovations. That cure for cancer may never materialize if governments stop offering financial support or ban mRNA use, or if people simply don’t trust it and won’t take it because they’ve become convinced by these conspiracies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But all of those things are unfolding at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The US health department’s recent decision to reevaluate a $600 million contract with Moderna to develop a shot that targets flu strains with particularly high pandemic potential has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/hhs-moderna-vaccine-contract-bird-flu-pandemic-preparedness-worries/?utm_campaign=morning_rounds&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--0nr6Aeec1gbwHMsYfVMd5mljKaMRo9pKhRckHIHx9cJeO8cOW_g-gzPYSCtJh6MD2YYuqQYhwtSNDjcs9TrLbUngN_g&amp;amp;_hsmi=349761000&amp;amp;utm_content=349761000&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;terrified&lt;/a&gt; public health experts.

Ron DeSantis, have &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/states-push-fight-against-mrna-vaccines"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for a ban on any vaccine mandates involving mRNA shots. Some state lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2025/03/04/iowa-lawmakers-advance-bills-key-deadline"&gt;want&lt;/a&gt; to press further, banning all mRNA vaccines for the people they represent. No such ban has yet become law but in the last year alone, legislation has been &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/states-push-fight-against-mrna-vaccines"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; in Idaho, Iowa, and Montana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I believe all the gene therapy products that are being used for immunization should be put on hold until we can determine their safety and efficacy,” &lt;a href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article299331544.html#storylink=cpy"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Idaho Republican Sen. Brandon Shippy. (The mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-covid-mrna-vaccines-wont-damage-your-dna1/"&gt;do not alter your genes&lt;/a&gt;, as gene therapies made specifically for genetic disorders like sickle cell disease are designed to do.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Many Republican voters not only believe the Covid-19 vaccines killed more people than Covid did, but they’re souring on other parts of the public health consensus, including long-held recommendations for &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/"&gt;childhood vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In a November 2024 paper, researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11564657/"&gt;looked at worldwide attitudes toward mRNA technology&lt;/a&gt; and discovered “widespread negative sentiment and a global lack of confidence in the safety, effectiveness, and trustworthiness of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For now, mRNA development in the US and around the world continues. Scientists are working on &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/116/7/479/7152285"&gt;a universal flu shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Receives-U.S.-FDA-Approval-for-RSV-Vaccine-mRESVIAR/default.aspx"&gt;respiratory virus vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. They are showing promising results with cancer vaccines, including for &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/can-mrna-vaccines-fight-pancreatic-cancer-msk-clinical-researchers-are-trying-find-out"&gt;diseases such as pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; that have resisted older treatments. Major pharmaceutical firms believe that mRNA could be harnessed &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/science/innovation/mrna-technology"&gt;to treat rare genetic disorders&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Covid showed that the science behind mRNA technology works.

I had no memory of watching it whatsoever, and I didn't watch many movies either at the time. So it was, it was a bit concerning.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Fraser thought little of it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until a few months before his diagnosis, in May last year, that he began experiencing 'some issues' with his cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fraser has invented ways to manage his symptoms, such as writing himself notes and asking his daughters to text him to let him know their plans, even if they've told him in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fraser struggled to 'think deeply', finding that his thoughts were unusually 'shallow' and 'surface level'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, a second major incident sparked alarm bells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fraser described a frightening evening spent driving around looking for his teenage daughter, who he mistakenly thought was missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, she has gone to the cinema — a plan she'd told him about earlier that day.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I remember my daughter had told me numerous times throughout the day that she'd go to the movies that night and it would be sort of quite late with a friend,'&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nZWKD_yPp0&amp;amp;t=3s"&gt; he said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It came to night time and I started freaking out, thinking, where's my daughter? I was driving to the nearby town trying to see if other friends had heard from her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And and it got to a point where I was about to ring the police, I was that concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'd been trying to call her, trying to phone message, trying to message her, and just not getting through to her at all. So yeah, really freaking out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And then she ends up calling me, saying, like, "hey dad, I've just been in the movies. Remember, I told you?"'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;These symptoms can be symptoms of mental illness, but they can also be a sign of dementia — the memory-robbing condition plaguing nearly 1million Brits and 7million Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon afterwards, Fraser sought medical help for his cognition problems, and was eventually given the life-changing diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, aged 41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only between five to 10 per cent of Alzheimer's cases are diagnosed in those under 65, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average time to diagnosis is 4.4 years in younger people, compared to 2.2 years for people aged over 65, according to charity Dementia UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; In the overwhelming majority of cases, Alzheimer's disease is not inherited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, faulty genes inherited from parents are much more likely to be a contributing factor in those diagnosed with the condition in their 30s and 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Society: 'In the really rare cases of a person developing Alzheimer’s disease in their 30s and 40s, it’s almost always because of a faulty gene.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since his diagnosis, Fraser has noticed other symptoms, which can be challenging to manage, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Birds of a Feather actress Pauline Quirke recently announced she has been diagnosed with dementia. The condition was spotted when she was just 61  - and is classed as early onset disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'I muddle up things when it comes to everyday scheduling,' he said.

So it was, it was a bit concerning.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Fraser thought little of it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until a few months before his diagnosis, in May last year, that he began experiencing 'some issues' with his cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fraser has invented ways to manage his symptoms, such as writing himself notes and asking his daughters to text him to let him know their plans, even if they've told him in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fraser struggled to 'think deeply', finding that his thoughts were unusually 'shallow' and 'surface level'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, a second major incident sparked alarm bells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fraser described a frightening evening spent driving around looking for his teenage daughter, who he mistakenly thought was missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, she has gone to the cinema — a plan she'd told him about earlier that day.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I remember my daughter had told me numerous times throughout the day that she'd go to the movies that night and it would be sort of quite late with a friend,'&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nZWKD_yPp0&amp;amp;t=3s"&gt; he said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It came to night time and I started freaking out, thinking, where's my daughter? I was driving to the nearby town trying to see if other friends had heard from her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And and it got to a point where I was about to ring the police, I was that concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'd been trying to call her, trying to phone message, trying to message her, and just not getting through to her at all. So yeah, really freaking out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And then she ends up calling me, saying, like, "hey dad, I've just been in the movies. Remember, I told you?"'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;These symptoms can be symptoms of mental illness, but they can also be a sign of dementia — the memory-robbing condition plaguing nearly 1million Brits and 7million Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon afterwards, Fraser sought medical help for his cognition problems, and was eventually given the life-changing diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, aged 41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only between five to 10 per cent of Alzheimer's cases are diagnosed in those under 65, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average time to diagnosis is 4.4 years in younger people, compared to 2.2 years for people aged over 65, according to charity Dementia UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; In the overwhelming majority of cases, Alzheimer's disease is not inherited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, faulty genes inherited from parents are much more likely to be a contributing factor in those diagnosed with the condition in their 30s and 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Society: 'In the really rare cases of a person developing Alzheimer’s disease in their 30s and 40s, it’s almost always because of a faulty gene.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since his diagnosis, Fraser has noticed other symptoms, which can be challenging to manage, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Birds of a Feather actress Pauline Quirke recently announced she has been diagnosed with dementia. The condition was spotted when she was just 61  - and is classed as early onset disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'I muddle up things when it comes to everyday scheduling,' he said. 'If someone organised something and then the plans change, I'll nearly always remember the first plan so I'll stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A fog just comes over your brain and you just can't really focus on things very well and you're in a haze.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the past six months Fraser has 'forgotten' how to do things he's practiced 'a thousand times', like turning off the shower and driving his partner's car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he's still able to go to work, and does not feel as though the symptoms are controlling him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he is increasingly finding himself exhausted at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My brain has had enough,' he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 10:46:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPSTN6eXQ4aExiQnpNM3drWjV3RE9YdEN2eWdEck4tMFJ6UUZ2cTZoTnlLR1pVZGR4Z3RyekUtVGtFWVlNZnpCSzhfVVd4V0ZxUWY1eEUwcEItT1N1M1cxWU5RaXBTUWx2U2U1dUVKU1dCREhqUzVrMVNBUWJualNVSFYtdDFXRUFxcTNTY0trN20yYzY2NFVwWUNucWM5YXM2WUZwZjdLS3hSQQ</guid></item><item><title>Can I get weight loss drugs on the NHS in Scotland? - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE45OFlKNzNwOG9WU0cwRExvSGhsenpTcGFWWnY1c1JMY3dra01wb2VoTmQycXBBbEhtTDZySlFLWVBPaUF1VTY5UHoxLTV4bjVOUXFFVEh4TEIxQdIBX0FVX3lxTE5wSGphamRzeVRvbmVTTk8tZ1RBeGhxWF9rMkxjamNnUDFYcy0wTGlYalp4OXdoeGw3Z19hSGo4S05RdlhkbFVaZUIzR2tiUi1EcUR1eXhua3FTOVZOYzRj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Who can get weight loss drugs on the NHS in Scotland?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Lisa Summers and Claire McAllister&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC Scotland news&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Angela Chesworth Two pictures of Angela Chesworth.

It has also been licensed under the brand name Ozempic for treating diabetes in some circumstances, but not for weight loss in this country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, another drug called tirzepatide was approved specifically for weight loss by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) under the brand name Mounjaro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since 2022, a third drug, liraglutide, has been approved under the name of Saxenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But all of these medications currently come with strict criteria for their prescription on the NHS as part of a phased introduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In phase one, they may only be prescribed to patients who have a BMI over 38 and at least one pre-existing weight-related health condition, such as high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Further phases will be planned when the evidence of prescribing data and outcomes has been analysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Scottish government said the aim of the phased introduction was "to ensure sustainable access for patients who need it most".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While the use of the drugs is limited on the NHS, they can also be bought privately – but pharmacists and doctors have warned of risks to patient safety through online sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Stricter checks were brought in last month to require in-person or video consultations, along with information from GP or medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;How many people are getting them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Most Scottish health boards are not currently prescribing Mounjaro or Wegovy for weight loss, which means that very few people are currently getting the drugs on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Freedom of Information requests by BBC News established that 5,866 people are currently being seen by specialist weight services in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Another 8,756 people are on waiting lists, and doctors said the number of people eligible for weight loss drugs was far higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, the health boards were unable to say how many people were getting Mounjaro or Wegovy specifically for weight loss on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;After the SMC granted approval, there was concern that not all health boards had a weight management service model to support the recommendations - and that the potential level of uptake, along with ongoing supply issues, could pose a challenge for budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Any patients to be prescribed the drugs on the NHS would need to see a specialist before starting the injections, and there are long waits for weight management services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;We asked all 14 regional health boards to tell us how many patients were receiving Wegovy or Mounjaro specifically for weight-loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The majority told us that because they can also be prescribed for patients with Type 2 diabetes, they were unable to distinguish whether they had been prescribed solely for weight loss purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Addy Mohammed, co-founder of Simple Online Pharmacy, said the latest data from pharmacy wholesalers suggested that more than a million people in the UK were now privately accessing weight loss medications -

It has also been licensed under the brand name Ozempic for treating diabetes in some circumstances, but not for weight loss in this country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, another drug called tirzepatide was approved specifically for weight loss by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) under the brand name Mounjaro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since 2022, a third drug, liraglutide, has been approved under the name of Saxenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But all of these medications currently come with strict criteria for their prescription on the NHS as part of a phased introduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In phase one, they may only be prescribed to patients who have a BMI over 38 and at least one pre-existing weight-related health condition, such as high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Further phases will be planned when the evidence of prescribing data and outcomes has been analysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Scottish government said the aim of the phased introduction was "to ensure sustainable access for patients who need it most".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While the use of the drugs is limited on the NHS, they can also be bought privately – but pharmacists and doctors have warned of risks to patient safety through online sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Stricter checks were brought in last month to require in-person or video consultations, along with information from GP or medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;How many people are getting them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Most Scottish health boards are not currently prescribing Mounjaro or Wegovy for weight loss, which means that very few people are currently getting the drugs on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Freedom of Information requests by BBC News established that 5,866 people are currently being seen by specialist weight services in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Another 8,756 people are on waiting lists, and doctors said the number of people eligible for weight loss drugs was far higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, the health boards were unable to say how many people were getting Mounjaro or Wegovy specifically for weight loss on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;After the SMC granted approval, there was concern that not all health boards had a weight management service model to support the recommendations -

Improbably, the work would prove foundational to our understanding of how humans learn about the world, and go on to win a Nobel Prize. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Since Donald Trump took office for a second time, he’s unleashed an unprecedented volley of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/donald-trump-executive-orders-signed-list" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/donald-trump-executive-orders-signed-list"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; targeting everything from scientific research to basic human rights. In turn, the sea hare experiments have taken on a new and unexpected salience, offering insights into how our brains may be processing the nonstop news cycle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At first glance, sea hares seem to have nothing in common with humans. But beneath their clammy brown skin, they have a nervous system that, like ours, is studded with interconnected neurons. In an effort to understand how these networks of neurons form memories, Kandel and his colleagues puffed &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5416541/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5416541/"&gt;jets of sea water&lt;/a&gt; onto the fragile, outstretched tails of the sea hares, the movement of the water mimicking the approach of a predator. At first, the sea hares flailed, their muscles contracting in a desperate effort to hide their vital organs. But as the scientists goaded their test subjects again and again, the sea hares’ neurons were physically altered by the trauma, their protective response dulling — and finally disappearing altogether. In the language of science, the sea hares had &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2714193/#:~:text=Pavlov%20(1927)%20was%20perhaps%20the,to%20the%20habituated%20orienting%20response." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2714193/#:~:text=Pavlov%20(1927)%20was%20perhaps%20the,to%20the%20habituated%20orienting%20response."&gt;habituated&lt;/a&gt; to the stimulus, no longer recognizing it as a threat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Habituation is essential to the ability of all animals — humans included — to function in a world that often feels chaotic. We habituate to the ticking of a clock, the din of a busy coffee shop, even the beating of our own noisy hearts. Amidst the assault of sensations competing for our attention, habituation helps us know what to focus on. But it can also become a liability, our brains designed to stop perceiving the familiar as a threat, even when it promises harm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;During his &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/trump-immigration-climate-dei-policies.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/trump-immigration-climate-dei-policies.html"&gt;first week in office,&lt;/a&gt; Trump’s second administration sought to end birthright citizenship, announced that the government would only recognize two sexes, and changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. For many, these decisions felt like déjà vu, a tired echo of the cruelty and horror of Trump’s first administration. But as in the case of the sea slugs, with the familiarity comes a danger: that we will become complacent, and that our barometer for what is normal, etched into the very proteins of our synapses, will be physiologically reset by these repeated shocks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Habituation is a part of how we process the world from the moment we’re born. When &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2605404/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2605404/"&gt;infants&lt;/a&gt; are presented with an image they’ve never seen before, their hearts begin to race. Their pupils dilate and they breathe faster, sucking with increased urgency on their pacifiers. But if they’re shown the same image again and again, they begin to ignore it. The novel becomes normal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Like so many neurologic phenomena, habituation has an inverse: sensitization, a mechanism by which even harmless stimuli can provoke a strong response. After hearing a gunshot, for instance, someone might be more likely to startle when she hears a knock at the door, or even feels the gentle touch of a friend’s hand against her shoulder. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In the case of the unfortunate sea hares, Kandel mimicked the jolt of the gunshot with a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.182.4116.1039" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.182.4116.1039"&gt;shock to the tail,&lt;/a&gt; after which the sea hares flailed with renewed vigor with every jet of water. When the shocks and squirts were repeated together multiple times over several days, the sea hares learned to fear the water as potently as the shocks, a &lt;a href="https://magazine.columbia.edu/article/minding-brain" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://magazine.columbia.edu/article/minding-brain"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; that lasted for weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In scientific terms, we habituate to benign stimuli that we have learned are unlikely to cause harm and are sensitized by noxious ones that exact actual pain. In our current political moment, the difficulty is that only some of us — often the members of communities already marginalized because of their &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/human-rights/the-targeted-chaos-of-trumps-attacks-against-international-human-rights-law-and-justice" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.aclu.org/news/human-rights/the-targeted-chaos-of-trumps-attacks-against-international-human-rights-law-and-justice"&gt;immigration status, economic status, or gender identity&lt;/a&gt; — will experience the pain of each new policy announcement, while others of us are able to blithely habituate to the repeated insults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When the sea hares learned to associate the jets of water with the shocks, the memory became indelibly etched into their synapses, strengthening the connections between individual neurons and creating a potent network. As we chart a path forward in the face of this onslaught, we must look not only at what we share with the sea hare, but also what makes us unique: our ability to make connections with one another, and our human capacity for empathy and solidarity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;We cannot let our animal instinct to habituate make us forget that we are in an unprecedented moment, and that it deserves an unprecedented response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pria Anand is a neurologist and the author of&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Mind-Electric/Pria-Anand/9781668064016" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Mind-Electric/Pria-Anand/9781668064016"&gt;The Mind Electric,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; out in June.

Alpha-gal syndrome, in which the immune system recognises animal proteins as invaders, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20160201-a-tick-bite-that-makes-you-allergic-to-red-meat" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;can lead to anaphylaxis and death&lt;/a&gt;. But this allergy, which can crop up after a lifetime of cheerful meat eating, is not related to switching to a low-meat diet. You can, for example, develop the condition after a tick bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For many who are avoiding meat, discovering that they have unknowingly consumed it can be emotionally painful – it can feel like a personal violation, says Kersten, who is a vegetarian himself. "That would make some people extremely sad," he explains. " I don't know if that would lead to physical symptoms. It certainly could trigger a lot of anger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But when you consider the biology of digestion, it is not as plausible as you might imagine that the body could, over a long period of time, lose the ability to digest meat. Meat is generally very easily digested, unlike the fibre in fruits, vegetables, and legumes. To break that up, our bodies require help from our microbiome, whose microbes do possess the enzymes necessary for digesting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;The human gut microbiome does morph and change depending on what its host eats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Moreover, the enzymes used to digest plant proteins are the same as those used on meat proteins. These enzymes recognise and sever particular chemical bonds in proteins. Whether they come from plants or animals, the proteins are made of building blocks called amino acids. Enzymes can generally break them up no matter where they came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This process is different from the case of, say, animal milk sugars like lactose. To digest lactose, your body requires a specific enzyme called lactase, and people who do not produce enough of the enzyme, making them lactose intolerants, can suffer a tummy upset after eating dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But with meat proteins, it does not make sense to think of the body somehow ceasing to make the enzymes necessary to digest a hamburger comfortably – they're always there, breaking down any protein that comes through, be it from pea, soybeans, or steaks, says Kersten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy Fibre-filled fruits and vegetables are actually more likely to cause digestive issues (Credit: Alamy)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Fibre-filled fruits and vegetables are actually more likely to cause digestive issues (Credit: Alamy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The human gut microbiome does morph and change depending on what its host eats, though. Sometimes this means that the specific types of bacteria there change; sometimes it's just that the microbes make other enzymes. While there are differences between the microbiomes of omnivores and vegetarians and vegans, they &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/08/nx-s1-5250259/how-meat-eaters-can-have-gut-microbes-as-healthy-as-vegans" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;do not seem to be radically divergent&lt;/a&gt;, so long as the omnivores consume a variety of plants, research has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Microbiomes can shift quickly as a result of dietary changes, however – one study in which people switched to a fully animal-based diet showed that a shift away from their baseline microbiome &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3957428/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;was visible within a day&lt;/a&gt; (it swiftly reverted back to normal once the diet ended). Subjects were encouraged to report any discomfort they felt, but nothing made it into the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If anything, it's the sudden consumption of large amounts of fibre after a long hiatus that could cause digestive problems. It's better to ease into such dietary changes. "Depending on the fibre, you can have some pretty strong reactions to it," says Kersten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In short, worrying about your body somehow losing the ability to digest meat shouldn't impair any plans you have to extend Veganuary into the spring. If you're among those who've had an upset stomach after eating meat following a long hiatus, a loss of enzymes is not likely to be the culprit, though this phenomenon remains understudied, Kersten says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The body is quite adaptable," he continues.

We think it is likely due to their ability to activate compensatory anti-inflammatory responses, which the aged animals lack," &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/clinical/psychiatry-and-behavioral-health/ruth-m-barrientos-phd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Ruth Barrientos, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Ruth Barrientos, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, study lead author, investigator at Ohio State University's Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research and associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral health and neuroscience at Ohio State University College of Medicine, said. "Also, with glucose, insulin and adipose inflammation all increased in both young and old animals, there's no way to distinguish what is causing memory impairment in only old animals if you look only at what's happening in the body. It's what is happening in the brain that's important for the memory response."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-food-for-brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Is the Worst Food for Brain Health?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What Is the Worst Food for Brain Health?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;OK, But What Does This Rat Study Have to Do With Me?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe nothing! (Hopefully, anyway!) However, researchers note that the study's purpose was to show that high-fat diets may impact health, including brain health, outside of obesity—and that research must be done to see the impacts of our diet and nutrition on our brains and the rest of our bodies, regardless of how much we weigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unhealthy diets and obesity are linked, but they are not inseparable," Dr. Barrientos said. "We're really looking for the effects of the diet directly on the brain. We showed that within three days, long before obesity sets in, tremendous neuroinflammatory shifts are occurring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changes in the body in all animals are happening more slowly and aren't actually necessary to cause the memory impairments and changes in the brain," Dr. Barrientos added. "We never would have known that brain inflammation is the primary cause of high-fat diet-induced memory impairments without comparing the two timelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1247845/kaitlin-vogel/favonoid-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: New Research Says Consuming Fruits and Veggies Can Do Wonders for Brain Health—Here's How to Get More In Your Diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: New Research Says Consuming Fruits and Veggies Can Do Wonders for Brain Health—Here's How to Get More In Your Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE41M2x6MHZSNHFOOGNjMmQxUjZkMWVnWTVGNFFBazEtT3FySVpnVXlKc2oyek04TlNLZEc2YmlPWVBxUGVIX0ttdGdOczY4M0RKUU5UN1ZEbWh2NjdTM0FZYWxkaDNCNGJHSUhwWGZoc1htMUI0VlFTRG84SE8</guid></item><item><title>Axios-Ipsos poll: COVID's enduring divides - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPOUdDSUVHNVRlemlTaThOTGxVaEp1dWRBYWZ5OFFsenFFTmRJWFdlVC1KSjRCcnFCN0VnMDRSd3A1bk9BUDdyMDlLaVZuc1laaWJIMkplbmYyX1ZGOFRNUnl6WGFkNWQ2NzFOUExYbVNUTEc0MFZyMUZuWGozd2Z1Z2ZDTFV4RWg5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:32:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPOUdDSUVHNVRlemlTaThOTGxVaEp1dWRBYWZ5OFFsenFFTmRJWFdlVC1KSjRCcnFCN0VnMDRSd3A1bk9BUDdyMDlLaVZuc1laaWJIMkplbmYyX1ZGOFRNUnl6WGFkNWQ2NzFOUExYbVNUTEc0MFZyMUZuWGozd2Z1Z2ZDTFV4RWg5</guid></item><item><title>Low-Carb Diets May Fuel Colorectal Cancer, Concerning New Study Reveals - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMGpfSUdYc3pmSllyWk5OdngxbHZHWlIxOXYxWkJRbWttc04xQVV4MWprUnZwcGJ3Z0lXaEhWZlV4bFV1ekJfZVpDNjcxN3hWeHFxRHlWNlI1VWFnWVNHTnRsMnp1b29fU3ZhM3NEdWdlajhXN0lDUWlpdm5CZGl5R1h6UDRwdUhvRm41ZFNnUTl1NVdzMnNxQ1E3VXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:02:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMGpfSUdYc3pmSllyWk5OdngxbHZHWlIxOXYxWkJRbWttc04xQVV4MWprUnZwcGJ3Z0lXaEhWZlV4bFV1ekJfZVpDNjcxN3hWeHFxRHlWNlI1VWFnWVNHTnRsMnp1b29fU3ZhM3NEdWdlajhXN0lDUWlpdm5CZGl5R1h6UDRwdUhvRm41ZFNnUTl1NVdzMnNxQ1E3VXM</guid></item><item><title>Millions living with hidden condition that causes sudden heart attacks... are you one of them?

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Esther SH Kim, statement author and director of the Center for Women’s Cardiovascular Health at Atrium Health in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/north-carolina/index.html" id="mol-ddee1c60-fdcc-11ef-b2ae-e7cecc88d9fe"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, said: 'Peripheral vascular disease is often under-recognized and understudied in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While differences in heart disease between men and women are increasingly recognized, equivalent focus on vascular diseases affecting blood vessels outside the heart remains lacking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing this week in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001310"&gt;Circulation&lt;/a&gt;, the American Heart Association team first looked at peripheral artery disease (PAD), the most common form of PVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Affecting about 10million Americans, PAD occurs in tiny blood vessels in areas other than the brain and heart, such as the legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may initially feel changes in their legs, such as pain while walking. Muscle weakness, hair loss, shiny skin, skin that is cool to the touch, and cold or numb toes are also common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who smoke, have high blood pressure, diabetes or are obese are all at higher risk for developing PAD, as these factors narrow blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within five years of a PAD diagnosis, one in three patients will die, and one in five will suffer a heart attack or stroke, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While PAD affects men and women almost equally, the researchers found women are more likely to experience either no symptoms at all or easily dismissed symptoms, such as walking at slower speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could lead to the disease progressing further, increasing the risk of deadly complications like stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphic from the American Heart Association's report shows the types of PVD women are at an increased risk of compared to men&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Southern states are more at risk of high death rates from heart disease, the latest data from the CDC shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, women with aortopathy - conditions affecting the heart's main muscle, the aorta - tend to be diagnosed at older ages and with more severe forms of the disease than men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is despite having a lower risk of aortic conditions like aneurysms, as estrogen can protect against them by reducing the amount of enzymes that would weaken blood vessel walls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analyzing a study from the UK, the team found women were three times more likely than men to have an aneursym rupture. Additionally, 30 percent of ruptures in women occurred with small aneurysms compared to eight percent in men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When an aneurysm - a bulging wall in a blood vessel - bursts, it leads to potentially deadly internal bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women undergoing surgery to repair their aorta were also more likely than men to suffer as stroke or die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, women are up to nine times more likely than men to suffer fibromuscular dysplasia, which causes thickening and narrowing of the arteries without plaque buildup, reducing blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition affects roughly 12 in 100,000 Americans and can lead to stroke and high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association researchers called for increased research on PVD in women, such as by including more women in clinical trials, analyzing sex differences in trials, and looking at treatment strategies targeted specifically in women.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kim said: 'PVD leads to significant illness and health complications. However, the disparities between women and men hinder equitable outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Identified disparities in effective prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care underscore the importance of tailored prevention and treatment strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Esther SH Kim, statement author and director of the Center for Women’s Cardiovascular Health at Atrium Health in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/north-carolina/index.html" id="mol-ddee1c60-fdcc-11ef-b2ae-e7cecc88d9fe"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, said: 'Peripheral vascular disease is often under-recognized and understudied in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While differences in heart disease between men and women are increasingly recognized, equivalent focus on vascular diseases affecting blood vessels outside the heart remains lacking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing this week in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001310"&gt;Circulation&lt;/a&gt;, the American Heart Association team first looked at peripheral artery disease (PAD), the most common form of PVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Affecting about 10million Americans, PAD occurs in tiny blood vessels in areas other than the brain and heart, such as the legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may initially feel changes in their legs, such as pain while walking. Muscle weakness, hair loss, shiny skin, skin that is cool to the touch, and cold or numb toes are also common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who smoke, have high blood pressure, diabetes or are obese are all at higher risk for developing PAD, as these factors narrow blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within five years of a PAD diagnosis, one in three patients will die, and one in five will suffer a heart attack or stroke, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While PAD affects men and women almost equally, the researchers found women are more likely to experience either no symptoms at all or easily dismissed symptoms, such as walking at slower speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could lead to the disease progressing further, increasing the risk of deadly complications like stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphic from the American Heart Association's report shows the types of PVD women are at an increased risk of compared to men&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Southern states are more at risk of high death rates from heart disease, the latest data from the CDC shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, women with aortopathy - conditions affecting the heart's main muscle, the aorta - tend to be diagnosed at older ages and with more severe forms of the disease than men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is despite having a lower risk of aortic conditions like aneurysms, as estrogen can protect against them by reducing the amount of enzymes that would weaken blood vessel walls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analyzing a study from the UK, the team found women were three times more likely than men to have an aneursym rupture. Additionally, 30 percent of ruptures in women occurred with small aneurysms compared to eight percent in men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When an aneurysm - a bulging wall in a blood vessel - bursts, it leads to potentially deadly internal bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women undergoing surgery to repair their aorta were also more likely than men to suffer as stroke or die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, women are up to nine times more likely than men to suffer fibromuscular dysplasia, which causes thickening and narrowing of the arteries without plaque buildup, reducing blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition affects roughly 12 in 100,000 Americans and can lead to stroke and high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association researchers called for increased research on PVD in women, such as by including more women in clinical trials, analyzing sex differences in trials, and looking at treatment strategies targeted specifically in women.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kim said: 'PVD leads to significant illness and health complications.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to purge conflicts of interest from the government agencies he's now in charge of, alleging close ties between employees and the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In his confirmation hearings for the role, he took aim at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/15/nx-s1-5293507/cdc-rfk-vaccine-advice" target="_blank"&gt;plays a key role&lt;/a&gt; in setting policies around vaccine schedules and access, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNKI2ORzEVc" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy said&lt;/a&gt; on Jan. 29 of the committee: "I think 97% of the people on it had conflicts. I think we need to end those conflicts and make sure that scientists are doing unobstructed science." He was citing an older government report on ethics disclosures, which he said came from a "government oversight investigation committee."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR tracked down &lt;a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2009/cdcs-ethics-program-for-special-government-employees-on-federal-advisory-committees/" target="_blank"&gt;that 2009 report&lt;/a&gt;, spoke with those involved with the CDC's vaccine advisory committee at the time, and learned that Kennedy's statement about it is inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Right now, what we're getting is a total misrepresentation of a 20-year-old report, about a process that was already being improved before that report was issued," says &lt;a href="https://resolvetosavelives.org/about/team/dr-tom-frieden" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Tom Frieden&lt;/a&gt;, CDC director from 2009 to 2017. He signed the agency's&lt;a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/documents/evaluation/2517/OEI-04-07-00260-Complete%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; letter in response&lt;/a&gt; to the report in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy reiterated his view, asserting that the agency's federal advisory panels are filled with members that have "severe, severe conflicts of interest" in a subsequent appearance &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368793267112" target="_blank"&gt;on Fox News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These statements have raised concerns with public health advocates that Kennedy may be laying the groundwork to kick members off the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, and replace them with members more aligned with his past advocacy work against vaccines. Prior to his current role, Kennedy founded the anti-vaccine organization Children's Health Defense and served as the group's chairman &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"&gt;from 2015 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the panel members are replaced with others less committed to preventing diseases with vaccines, "you could get worse recommendations or you could make vaccines less accessible," says Dr. Walter Orenstein, who served as director of the U.S. immunization program at the CDC from 1988 to 2004 and is now professor emeritus at the Emory School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Conflicts of interest have always been declared and documented at public vaccine advisory committee meetings, but on Friday, Kennedy's team pulled together the last 25 years of conflicts &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/disclosures/by-member.html#cc-widget-b787" target="_blank"&gt;on a list&lt;/a&gt; and posted it to the CDC website.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Rather than conflicts of interest being buried within meeting minutes, this tool quickly provides the public with ACIP members' conflicts of interest," Andrew Nixon, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote to NPR in an email.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In response to a request for comment on this story, Nixon said: "Secretary Kennedy is committed to ensuring radical transparency across HHS."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Most problems on disclosures were paperwork errors&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The 2009 report, titled "&lt;a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2009/cdcs-ethics-program-for-special-government-employees-on-federal-advisory-committees/" target="_blank"&gt;CDC's Ethics Program for Special Government Employees on Federal Advisory Committees&lt;/a&gt;" comes from the Office of Inspector General for HHS.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's an audit of ethics paperwork filed in 2007. It covers all 17 CDC advisory committees at the time, comprising around 250 members who gave guidance on topics like smoking, tuberculosis, and improving clinical labs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The review, contrary to Kennedy's characterization, it did not find serious conflicts among most members. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What it found was problems with committee members' disclosure paperwork: 97% of the financial disclosure forms filed contained errors or omissions, such as people putting information in the wrong section of the form or incompletely filling out a section, or reviewers forgetting to initial and date amendments to the pages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Dale Morse, who chaired the CDC's vaccine advisory committee from 2007 to 2009, remembers working through &lt;a href="https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/OGE%20Forms/2026049D943E0C34852585B6005A23CE/$FILE/OGE%20Form%20450%20Confidential%20Financial%20Disclosure%20Report.pdf?open" target="_blank"&gt;those forms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a painful process — like doing your taxes but worse," he says. "You had to list every single category that was listed in [each] portfolio," such as naming each stock or mutual fund held in a retirement account.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Compared to other committees he's served on, Morse says that he thinks ACIP "would be the most complete," in terms of compliance with ethics requirements, Morse says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But it's hard to say for sure because the report does not break down the analysis by specific committee, and that information is not accessible, said Melissa Rumley, public affairs specialist in the HHS Office of Inspector General, in response to an inquiry from NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She added that she "cannot confirm" that Kennedy's statement about ACIP "was true at the time of our review."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To Frieden, the way that Kennedy characterizes the report amounts to "classic misinformation." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You start with something that has a kernel of truth — that there was a problem with completing these forms," he says. "And you conflate that [by saying] there are conflicts of interest, which in this case, is absolutely false."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to actual conflicts of interest that should have been addressed, the number in the report is dramatically less than Kennedy alleged.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The report finds that seven out of 246 members across the CDC's advisory committees voted on issues they were explicitly not allowed to vote on. All were on the same committee, though the report does not name which one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I believe that the report is accurate, but when you get down to things that might have been a problem, it's down to 3%," says Dr. Carol Baker, a member of the vaccine advisory committee from 2006 to 2012, who served as chair after Morse.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That is a clear policy violation, so the Office of the Inspector General investigated these cases — and determined that they "did not rise to the level of criminal violations" but stemmed largely from CDC's "systemic lack of oversight" at the time, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The report also faulted CDC for not identifying &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; conflicts of interest for 58% of committee members. In response, the agency said that the report overstated the problem since it counted a category that was considered exempt: researchers employed by an institution that has any grants related to committee matters, even if they're run by other researchers in different departments.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Taking conflicts of interest seriously&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccine advisory committee was strict, in enforcing ethics rules, Baker recalls. Back in 2006, she was an hour or two into her first public meeting as a new voting member, when a CDC staffer interrupted the proceedings. "She tapped me on the shoulder and said, 'Come with me now.' I said, 'Should I bring my purse?' — 'No, bring nothing.' It was dramatic being asked to leave the meeting," Baker says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The staffer from CDC's legal team erroneously believed that Baker had a "serious conflict" of interest based on the forms she had submitted, and escorted her from the meeting. "It turned out it was just a clerical error," Baker says, but the fact that she was nearly kicked out of her first meeting because they thought she had a conflict of interest reflects how seriously they took the issue, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Several recent ACIP members who have gone through the process within the past five years told NPR the process is intensive. They've filled out those forms for themselves and their family members, and had interviews with CDC staff tasked with managing conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's been such a public eye on the committee — even more so in the past decade," said one former member, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation. "The process was very, very rigorous."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Members must declare financial ties and relationships they have with vaccine companies, and sever those that conflict with their ability to serve on the advisory committee, which is a voluntary, unpaid position.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those past ties often exist for valid research purposes, says the former ACIP member: "We're not shilling for the manufacturer — we're trying to answer scientific questions." Researchers sometimes work with manufacturers to test their products in studies, or to give advice on best practices.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Baker, who is known by her peers as the "&lt;a href="https://www.sabin.org/resources/dr-carol-baker-receives-2019-albert-b-sabin-gold-medal/" target="_blank"&gt;godmother of Group B &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt; prevention,&lt;/a&gt;" recalls giving up her involvement with a company developing a vaccine against the bacteria to serve on ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a big sacrifice personally," Baker says. She had made a key scientific discovery that led to the vaccine. "I was very emotionally involved, and they felt I was the best person to give them advice and they paid me for my time, which I think is fair."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On joining the vaccine advisory committee, she cut ties with the company for six years. Serving the public mattered more: "I thought I could do more good in my life to prevent children from getting sick or being damaged or even dying by my work on ACIP," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Misleading statements could sow doubt about vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Frieden, the former CDC director, agrees that conflicts of interest are cause for concern. "It is important to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. It is important that any potential conflict of interest that may unduly influence a recommendation be investigated," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, Frieden says Kennedy's misleading statements "can undermine confidence in what is a very transparent, fact-based process," in which the committee debates and makes vaccine policies in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvrp9iOILTQb6D9e1YZWpbUvzfptNMKx2" target="_blank"&gt;public live streamed meetings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy's team has already postponed or canceled some public meetings &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/20/nx-s1-5304233/cdc-vaccine-meeting-delayed" target="_blank"&gt;of the CDC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5311670/the-fda-has-canceled-an-important-upcoming-meeting-about-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;FDA vaccine advisory&lt;/a&gt; committees that would have addressed topics such as "how to protect infants from meningitis, which travelers should get a new vaccine that would prevent severe prolonged joint pain," and how flu vaccines should be updated, Frieden says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sowing doubts on the integrity of vaccine policymaking could lead to fewer people getting routine vaccines, says Orenstein at Emory. "It really scares me. I've seen measles, I've seen polio cases," he says. "I am very, very concerned that what is happening now will lead to more decreases in vaccine uptake and the return of these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It also hampers the development of new and better vaccines that could have led to a healthier future, Orenstein says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have information you want to share about the ongoing changes across the federal government?

Another epidemic has claimed even more lives - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxNRHdFWVIwLTNMMUFSV0tPOEo2Z1pYdVRkRjBkdUZrOEJoa1RPRWVyVlBsR24xOGJYZEtCaml1ekk2TjJDeEJxM1NSMjhPZTVSVkI5Y0xFTUxaQ0FLRUVjYVZsTmFobFZ4bDZ4TFlOZWc1WFVyVHkxVDhad0t1eVA1a1pfWnUzRGNYVUh0dXF4a05pX0xDdnItTVdHTWx4MzI2V1RQNVhVYldQRW5WbzFOdkwtbnFjUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2020s have inarguably been Covid-19’s decade. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the coronavirus outbreak was acknowledged as a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/who-declares-the-coronavirus-outbreak-a-pandemic/"&gt;pandemic exactly five years ago&lt;/a&gt;, the pandemic has killed well over 1 million Americans, derailed the global economy, and sparked political upheaval that continues today. It also yielded what many hail as the greatest scientific accomplishment in human history: the development of effective vaccines in under a year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet in dominating the early 2020s, Covid-19 also distracted from what is arguably a more significant public health emergency. Even at the height of the pandemic, more young Americans died of drug overdose than Covid. And in the last year, the overall death toll from the country’s drug crisis has exceeded the Covid-19 pandemic as the deadliest health event this generation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Amidst all of this very tragic loss of life in the Covid pandemic, we lost sight of the fact that more young people were dying from drug overdoses than from Covid,” Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in a recent interview. “I was just exasperated. … Nobody was paying attention, or putting in the resources necessary to actually treat them, and prevent those deaths.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over 1.25 million people have died of non-alcohol drug overdose between 1999 and 2024, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting the crisis a tick ahead of overall U.S. deaths from Covid-19. With roughly 85,000 overdose deaths still occurring annually, the gap is sure to grow. &lt;/p&gt;


		
		



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drug deaths’ reemergence as the No. 1  driver of accidental deaths in the past quarter-century is a grim reminder that the overdose crisis continues largely unabated. In recent decades, waves of addiction and overdose driven first by prescription painkillers, then heroin, then fentanyl, and now a deadly mix of fentanyl and stimulants has destroyed families, significantly slowed the U.S. economy, and even shortened the country’s overall life expectancy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It highlights, also, a jarring disconnect between the nation’s response to the two health emergencies, and the degree to which the Covid-19 pandemic helped erase what little momentum the nation’s drug crisis response had left. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In interviews, leading addiction experts at medical societies, government research agencies, and nonprofit advocacy groups uniformly agreed that the country has failed to adequately respond to the overdose crisis since it began around 1999. They assigned blame to a number of factors: fragmented leadership, stigma and misinformation about addiction, failure to recognize it as a medical condition. Most acutely, they argued that many Americans simply lack sympathy or a sense of urgency — and above all, the efforts that do exist generally lack the funds they need to be truly effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The call to action really has to get some funding support behind it,” said Patty McCarthy, the CEO of the nonprofit advocacy group Faces &amp;amp; Voices of Recovery. “We know what we need to do. We don’t need to continue to debate the solutions. We just need to put a coordinated effort behind it to make a system that works for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if urgency is lacking, the impact of the problem reverberates. Beyond the death toll, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589871X19301470#:~:text=drug%20overdose%20deaths.-,When%20corrected%20for%20these%20losses%2C%20the%20annual%20cost%20from%20the,(GDP)%20%5B2%5D." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;some estimates&lt;/a&gt; say drug addiction causes economic damage equivalent to 2% of the gross domestic product. Overdose deaths skyrocketed when  Covid-19 arrived and caused widespread social isolation, just as the illicit drug supply was growing more toxic. While the current annual death toll has fallen well below its peak of roughly 114,000 in early 2023, drug overdose remains a leading cause of accidental death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The country’s response to the two crises, however, is a jarring case study in the singular nature of America’s Covid-19 response — and by contrast, how little attention people pay to the addiction crisis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the immediate response to Covid, public officials encouraged strict social isolation protocols, poured billions into the development of vaccines and therapeutics, and then spent billions more on support programs for Americans suffering in the wake of Covid-related economic collapse. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The country’s response to the addiction crisis, by contrast, has been defined more by rhetoric than by action. Four successive presidential administrations — Obama, Trump, Biden, and now Trump again — have cited the opioid crisis as a key domestic policy priority. Many members of Congress have introduced and even passed bills on specific aspects of policy related to addiction treatment or law enforcement.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But none of these efforts ever came close to matching the scope of the federal drive that resulted in the first Americans receiving vaccines in December 2020, less than a year after Covid-19 made its presence known. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The $18 billion vaccine effort, known as Operation Warp Speed and executed in partnership with Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, and other drug companies, stands in stark contrast to the continued lack of funding for overdose prevention and new addiction treatment medications. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Brian Hurley, the president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, argued in an interview that even the medications that already exist, like methadone and buprenorphine, remain underutilized, and the federal government hasn’t done enough to encourage their use. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While regulations surrounding methadone and buprenorphine have been moderated in recent years, the medications remain difficult to obtain, as documented in &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/category/war-on-recovery/"&gt;“The War on Recovery,”&lt;/a&gt; a STAT investigative series. Doctors are not allowed to prescribe methadone, meaning the medication is only available at specialized clinics, and few physicians prescribe buprenorphine. Many pharmacies refuse to stock buprenorphine, and many incarcerated people are also denied access to the medications, in violation of &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-issues-guidance-protections-people-opioid-use-disorder-under-americans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;guidance issued in 2022&lt;/a&gt; by the Department of Justice. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you look at the adoption and spread of vaccination versus the adoption and spread of medications for opioid use disorder, they’re light years apart,” he said. “I am not in any way taking away from that considerable investment in vaccination technology, but we would love to see big, bold action around access to addiction medications.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To this day, only a minority of people with opioid addiction receive methadone or buprenorphine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another factor that could explain the gap in response, Hurley said, is that many Americans’ attitude toward people who use drugs remains more moralistic than compassionate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s decades of literature making it clear that addiction is a chronic illness, but I don’t know that everyone thinks of it that way,” Hurley said. “There was very clear alignment that a virus-driven pandemic is a medical illness. It really wasn’t up for debate&lt;em&gt;.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all addiction-related news is cause for despair, however. After peaking in early 2023, drug deaths began to plummet, and the rolling 12-month death toll has steadily dropped for each period the CDC has published data, with the most recent update showing a continued decline through last September. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Volkow, the NIDA director, said it was difficult to attribute the declining death rates to a single cause, citing a combination of factors including a less toxic drug supply and the fact that the crisis has already claimed the lives of many of the most vulnerable drug users. She underscored, too, that improved access to certain treatment and harm reduction measures has worked as intended, resulting in greater medication uptake and fewer fatal overdoses.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But she cautioned that the declining deaths are not happening universally — deaths are still on the rise in specific states, like Nevada and Alaska, as well as in specific demographic groups, including among Black and Native American people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The availability of Covid-level funding, too, could soon become a reality, thanks to billions of dollars that have begun to flow toward states, local and tribal governments, from settlements reached by drug manufacturers and distributors who played a role in accelerating the opioid crisis in the 1990s and early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The local recipients often have broad leeway when it comes to how the funds are spent. Much of the money has gone toward direct remediation efforts, like childhood education about drug use, purchasing naloxone and fentanyl test strips, or expanding access to addiction medications. Some localities, however, have used the money for administrative costs or to pad local governments’ rainy-day funds. Much of the money still hasn’t been spent.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But McCarthy, the Faces &amp;amp; Voices of Recovery CEO, said the settlement funds process so far has fallen short of its potential, and that the spending strategy hasn’t been guided by the type of sweeping, transformative vision the current crisis requires. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing is a really missed opportunity to do something significant,” she said. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Isolation kills, stigma kills, and we could do better.”&lt;/p&gt;

The majority prescribe compounded copies of the drugs — a tenuous business strategy as shortages of the branded versions of the medications have &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/21/fda-declares-end-to-semaglutide-shortage-threatens-makers-compounded-version-ozempic-wegovy/"&gt;come to an end&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, some businesses are setting their sights on another opportunity in compounding: hormones. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dozens of wellness and direct-to-consumer telehealth companies offering GLP-1s have begun marketing cash-pay hormone replacement therapy to women in perimenopause and menopause, and testosterone replacement therapy to men. Noom, best-known for its weight loss app and more recent GLP-1 offering, launched an HRT program for menopause in late February, and telehealth company Hims &amp;amp; Hers plans to roll out at-home testing over the next year to enable care for low testosterone, perimenopause, and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              A few months ago, I went to a lab in Toronto where a team of researchers put a cap on my head with cold, gooey gel and dozens of wires connected to it.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              64 electrodes that are being fitted to your cap. Feels weird. Oh, the cool gel is a weird feeling.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              They also had me spit into a test tube and rate how stressed I was feeling.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We're seeing the signature of a relaxation response in the heart. We're also seeing it in some of the brain waves that you see below.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'I was participating in a test that would measure my brainwaves, my heart rate, and my cortisol levels. All to see how I would react to music. The lab is run by the head scientist for LUCID, a company that's trying to turn music into medicine with the help of technology to treat anxiety, depression, burnout, and other mental health conditions. LUCID's apps have a growing library of music tracks. They use artificial intelligence and facial recognition to detect your emotions as you listen. Their technology reads your face in real time, and based on that, it'll curate what song comes next? I was fascinated when I first heard about LUCID, because I think we're all familiar with how music can affect our emotions. Outside of work, my partner and I spent much of the year traveling to see our favorite band perform live, so I know this feeling well. But LUCID is using technology to harness this power of music in a more targeted way. So I was wondering, can AI-powered music technology actually help us feel better? To find out, I talked to Aaron Labbé. He's the co-founder of LUCID and its chief technology officer, and a musician himself.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I listen to music all the time, and then I've got a piano next to me as well that I used to tinker with throughout the day. So, you know, from morning to night, I would say my ears are being occupied with music primarily. And then I would say, you know, podcasts and things like that too.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I'm Clare Duffy and this is Terms of Service.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Aaron started developing the idea for LUCID when he was in college. The company is an evolution of his thesis project. It came at a time in his life when he really needed music.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I really started thinking about this concept through my mental health journey about ten years ago, when I was suffering and in and out of the mental health system. I started to use music in some novel ways on myself.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And when you say you were using music on yourself, what do you mean by that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, so I was creating playlists for different mood states that I knew was helping me get to a desired mood state. I was infusing what's called auditory beat stimulation into music, which is scientifically grounded tones and frequency responses in the ear that can, you know, provide an anxiety reduction or an intense focus state.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Auditory beat stimulation is a way of using specific sounds to stimulate your brainwaves, ideally to calm you down. Studies show that certain frequencies can help you calm your mind or get in focus, like in this track...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So I was taking those tones and I was infusing them into music in a way that made it really pleasurable to listen to, so I could listen for long periods of time. And at least at the time, I was finding that it was really helpful for me. And I hypothesized that if there's a way to, like, package this up, there might be some impact on others as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah, I think a lot of us can sort of relate to that, just sort of intuitive sense of how music can impact our mood or our well-being?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Did you know at the time that you sort of started work on this, that there was science to back up this idea?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I knew that there was science. I was really getting into music neuroscience more from like a nerd approach, not necessarily by traditional education. But then in my fourth year at university, I connected with Dr. Frank Russo, who's our chief science officer, and I started to see that not only was there anecdotal research that I was aware of, but there's a lot of scientific literature to support music as medicine.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Anything in particular that maybe surprised you about the relationship between music and our mental health?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, I mean, I was surprised with how powerful it truly was, right? Like as a musician, I expected that, but I'm also a musician and music is everything to me. But the idea that just your average listener can also have these ridiculously immense therapeutic experiences with music that was really surprising and encouraging and really bolstered my idea of making this my life's work. You know, it was really exciting to see.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Aaron and his team's research led to LUCID's first product: Resonance Rx. It's an FDA-approved app that clinicians can prescribe for dementia or Alzheimer's patients in the US. It's designed to treat symptoms like anxiety, agitation, or memory loss. Resonance uses AI to curate playlists of existing popular music to prompt an emotional response, and facial recognition to evaluate if it's working.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              The way that they interact with it is similar to a web app of any kind that has content on it. You choose what activity you want to do. You know, you could do a music session, you can do a meditation session, you can do a podcast session that we've developed, and from there you just use it and consume the content. And the data is measuring your responses in order to send that data to the doctor and provide actionable insights while also driving the recommendation systems that we have developed for the music therapy as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So, say I'm a patient, my doctor has prescribed Resonance Rx, I am going to go log in to the platform for the first time. What am I going to see? How does it work?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, so if you're logging in for the first time, we have an onboarding process that usually a nurse will will interact with the patient throughout to help them through the process. That'll include, you know, general demographic information. You know, how old they are, what state they're in, things like that. And then, we move on to a music preference survey. If the patient remembers, we encourage them to tell us a little bit of cues to help us get a warmer start to their recommendations, right? What areas of music they like, what genres of music they like. And then we go right into their first session, basically after that, we encourage people to do a music session right off the bat and then, you know, start experiencing the music.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And so the system is looking at like the patient's face, you're using facial recognition to gauge their response to it?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, we have a computer vision system that looks at microexpressions on the face in addition to motion. So how their heads bobbing, whether they're synchronizing with the music. These are all data points that we can ingest and use AI to determine whether or not they are being absorbed by the music, and if we need to adapt the session, basically.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And what is the ultimate goal of interacting with the platform? Is it to make you feel a specific way, feel relaxed?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah. The goal of the platform is at-large to monitor the patient, to provide mental health support and symptom relief. I would say like the music therapy component that we've developed, the goal is to evoke a state of reminiscence or nostalgia, which is, you know, finding the needles in the haystack of music for that patient and evoking this really powerful emotional response that they get. You know, when we're younger, we build these really powerful connections with certain songs. I think we've all experienced what that feels like when your song comes on the radio and you know, you just light up.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's love. That's what all the people say.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And that's called an absorption event. And that's something that for me and for Dr. Russo and, and the team we find really exciting as a research prospect is to kind of engineer those moments more frequently and get people in that headspace because the symptom relief that they feel is strong. But it also, you know, provides them an amazing quality of life as they're going through this very serious challenge.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Aaron says the goal of this curated music, like Frank Sinatra's "That's Life", is to boost people's moods and to help with memory.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              A lot of that has to do with that kind of reminiscence, right? That reminiscence therapy of remembering who you are, right? With this population, we really believe that that's the thing that's driving this forward.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              For this to work, Aaron and his team are pulling music from all kinds of genres, keeping their target audience in mind.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's a growing catalog that we're trying to grow based on our user base. We want to, you know, curate the right content depending on the people that we have on our platform. So, for example, you know, clinical trials, you know, it was 40s, 50s and 60s music, right? Right now we've got a bit of a younger population coming in. People who are now 65, newly on Medicare, just starting to be on their journey through their mental health process around cognitive decline, potentially. You know, we're starting to get more Latin American folks onto the platform. So we're bringing Latin catalog. Right now we're even looking at research in Korea. So we're curating music in Korea as well. So you know this is all something that we find as being really important. It's called the musicological approach to curation, which is looking at kind of the cultures and the societies that we are building this around.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's going to be so interesting for you as a musician, like getting to explore new areas of music that, that maybe you weren't familiar with. Do you have any favorite tracks on the platform?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. So right now I'm really into "Tainted Love", you know, that's a great 80s track.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That ones pretty fun. And you know, there's always your, like the Beatles is always up there, I'm a big fan of the Beatles, and it's no surprise that our audiences are as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Are there ever risks that the system gets it wrong and has sort of the opposite of the intended effect? Like it plays a song and somebody doesn't like that one or something?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, I mean, there's always a risk, right? Recommendations aren't perfect. We're doing our best to make them as smart as possible. But at the end of the day, AI still has limitations. So it's very easy for somebody to bypass the algorithm if they want to, right? I think that's very important when we talk about AI in healthcare, is that there is guardrails to protect against things like that. There's a couple of buttons that allow them to skip ahead. You know, one that basically says, I just want to hear this right now. One that says, I don't like this song, please delete it from my library. And these are things that allow us to correct when the recommendation isn't working properly. And then, you know, we can take that and add it to the learning cycle of the algorithm as well, so that it improves. So, I think that's a really important piece that we can't forget, right? Humans, they know what they want, right? There's no reason to not allow them to intervene if they need to.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              How do you think about how the use of music compares to the use of traditional medications when it comes to treating these conditions, or maybe complements traditional medicine?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, I mean, I think they have to go hand in hand, especially when you talk about something like dementia, right? There's these amazing opportunities to take these medications that are helping, say, the root cause of the cognitive decline, but the anxiety features are not really mitigated, the agitation is it mitigated. Now, you bring music in to have a more holistic picture of care, right? And that's really what companies like us are trying to do is, is merge those worlds together.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Do you imagine that this combination of AI and music will ultimately be used more widely to treat other conditions, other types of patients. Is that something that LUCID is working on?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, I mean, that's what we want to do. We want to be a biotech company building, you know, different digital molecules, if you will, of music, right? For, you know, varying mental health and physical health challenges, even. We're looking at a variety of areas that we think music can have a powerful impact and, you know, we're eager to build those tools for people long term.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Following the success of Resonance Rx, LUCID is now studying whether it's possible to compose or arrange music to have a specific impact on anyone's mood or mental health, like helping with anxiety or enhancing focus.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We have a tool that we've developed called BioMirror, and what this does is it learns the musical features that correlate with certain biological responses in the body. And we think this technology can help composers and creators build fit for purpose music, functional music that can provide anxiety relief, for example, or enhance focus. You know, very specific things in the music can can do this. It's something that is still in the early stages, but we believe it's possible.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, one of the things that I noticed when I was doing this test is that there are certain musical sounds, like for me, it's the slide guitar sound that like "warrr" that like,
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              feels good in my body to listen to.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Is that part of what your, is that what you're trying to accomplish or better understand here?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. That's the thing that we're really trying to map out, right? Is like what are the timbres, right, the acoustic sounds that that make people feel certain things so that we can build the music from the ground up, make it something that's like really visceral and powerful.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Are there any early results from that research that you can share, or ways that you think it's going to direct what you're working on?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, I mean, so we've got a study that we did a few years ago, which was the an anxiety trial focused on the general population that use fit for purpose music, right? So is music that we had, you know, composed and recommended for this use case. And in addition to the auditory beat stimulation infusion that we that we do, the study that you semi participated in is still ongoing. We're really trying to in that case look at physiological markers like the brain, EEG signals, things like that. I believe you spit in a valve...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So, so we're looking at cortisol levels too, right. Which is something that you can get from saliva and now we're trying to basically go a layer deeper.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. In my, in my experience. And it was, as you said, not a full real trial, but it was a few minutes of, you know, measuring how maybe stressed I was before going in and then doing that again after having listened to the music. And at least my personal sort of takeaway was I did feel, it was like ten minutes maybe, but I did feel better leaving after listening to the music. It was very cool.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's good to hear. Yeah, I'm glad to hear that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Coming up, are AI and music the future of mental health care? And how can we experiment with this technology? That's after the break.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Resonance Rx is targeted at very specific users. But Aaron says there are still ways for all of us to experiment with using music for our mental health. LUCID has a website called vibemusic.ai where you can try this technology yourself. You choose a category of music you want: calm, focus, energize or sleep. And as you listen, it's facial recognition technology monitors your face through your computer's camera to detect shifts in your mood. Can you kind of describe when you talk about that fit for purpose music, what kinds of things people might actually hear? Like maybe you can talk about the calm version, what you might actually be hearing and why you like it or why it might work.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah. So the com content, it's very warm sounding. There's a lot of very round sounds, if you will. There's, there's nothing too sharp, nothing too piercing. The timing and rhythm is very calming, very soothing. There's not very complex rhythmic things happening. The tempo, it can vary, but generally things are very laid back sounding. There's a lot of layers. It's very like dense music, and it allows your brain to kind of attach to things and wander, which is a really nice thing when you're trying to de-escalate or take yourself out of things. And that's really what the calm mode is designed for, is, is anxiety relief. But also just like getting your brain out of this like high functioning mode and trying to decompress. In addition to the music, there's a layer of auditory beat stimulation, which is stimulating or aims to stimulate your theta brainwave patterns, which is the brainwaves that are associated with deep relaxation.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I am personally curious whether you have found like, is there any truth to this idea that it can be helpful to listen to music that matches your mood? Like, if you're sad listening to sad music, I feel like that's a thing a lot of us do.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. So that's actually one of the things that we consider in our, in our algorithm, right, is, is to take someone from their current state and then move them to a target state. But I think starting with where they are is certainly something that a lot of literature is starting to support. We're actually doing research on this in a trial right now in the UK around whether this concept called the ISO principle works, which is finding your mood, matching that, and then ultimately dragging you towards something positive.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Do you think that AI, you know, in music is fundamentally going to change how we deliver mental health care in the future?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I mean, I certainly hope so. I think we're already starting to do it, right? We're just one company, and I think music is medicine is a space that can expand to a lot of different areas. But I think at the very least, there is now a conversation happening a lot more seriously than it used to around music's place in the medical environment. And I think AI is a big catalyst for that. I think I allows us to quantify things that we couldn't before, and it allows us to do contextual delivery of something that is very contextually based, right? Like the music I need to hear right now is not necessarily music I need to hear in an hour or tomorrow, right? And and AI is perfect at kind of figuring all that out.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Obviously your product is currently targeted at a pretty specific type of customer. Is there a way for anybody to apply this idea to improve their own mental health? Like, do you have tips on how maybe you can use this concept, for anybody listening?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              On your own, yeah, I think like building playlists honestly are are really, it's a it's really easy and good thing to do for yourself, right? Contextual playlist, things that like you notice are really helping you in certain moments of time like when you're feeling sad. If you've got songs that tend to uplift you, put that on a sad playlist, right? And I think thinking about it less of, you know, background listening and more about like active listening, because I think that's another thing that with how we interact with media these days, it's just, you know, kind of flippantly and in a transient space. But if you lay down in bed and put headphones in, and if you find a song that absorbs you, that that gets you fully immersed, it's amazing where your brain will go and how good you'll feel afterward.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's such a good and interesting point about like, not just putting it on in the background while you're doing 17 other things, as we all like to do, will you just sort of talk about like, why given your experience going through this sort of traditional mental health care system, why you think it's beneficial or important to have these sort of like alternate therapy options that complement the sort of traditional methods of treating people's mental health conditions?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I did not have a very positive experience in the mental health system, unfortunately. The challenge with with a lot of these, you know, pathologies is they're very complex. The brain is very complex. We still don't fully understand how it's functioning. A lot of the time when it comes to these very complex challenges, but you end up having this round robin of medication. There's a lot of people who tend to get, you know, disenfranchized from that process. They really do not enjoy what their body goes through, what the brain goes through. And although these medications ultimately, you know, work for a lot of people, the process of getting there is miserable for a lot of folks, right? It's very unpleasant. And for me, I ultimately was able to add a little bit of better quality of life, if you will, through through this music infusion. And I think that's what these tools can do, right? Is help mitigate the symptoms so that you have a more holistic picture. I also think it forces us to start having a bigger conversation about what the quality of life is in general, of somebody who is going through a mental health crisis. Because if you start to bring in things like music, now you're looking at the whole person in a different way. It's not just, you know, take a pill and then go home, right? It's like, well, then maybe we should talk about, you know, social work integration. We need to talk about, you know, food and diet. We need to talk about, you know, everything that makes up this journey. And I think that's what this whole effort is all about.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Aaron, for you, how has working on LUCID changed how you approach caring for your own mental health?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah, I mean, it certainly is reinforced music's place in my life in that way. And it also, you know, it also has reinforced the importance of just doing it generally, right? I think, especially in my recovery process. Once I started to feel a lot better, then I started a startup with a couple of co-founders, and then there were moments of that where it's like, wow yeah, there's I'm also not well, again, right, because running a startup is very stressful.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. So so, you know, it's and it's ironic, you know, I'm working at a mental health startup, and then in moments of bad mental health, it's like, all right, I think I should be doing better, right? Because I talk the talk, if you will, right? So it's certainly forced me to have very good hygiene around all of this and maintain good practices. And I think that that's one of the the pleasures of working with this stuff every day.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, thank you so much for talking to us, Aaron.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I appreciate talking about it. And thank you, Clare, for the conversation. It's been great.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Thanks so much to Aaron and to the whole LUCID team for letting me try out their technology. As I was considering the takeaways for today's episode, I was thinking about how often on this show we talk about the potential perils and pitfalls of AI and facial recognition, but LUCID is a reminder that there's so much promise for this technology to help people too. If you want to try using the idea behind LUDCID's technology for yourself, Aaron recommends putting on headphones and just listening to music, with no other distractions. You can try creating a playlist that starts with one mood or feeling, maybe it sounds a bit more sad or mellow and then transitions to another, like something more upbeat or happy. And we'll leave you with this track that Aaron hopes will calm you down, see if it works for you. Until next time, I'm Clare Duffy. Catch you next week.
            &lt;/p&gt;

It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While there is no explicit reference to this side effect in patient leaflets, the UK medicines regulator told us there was a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.1160.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;general warning&lt;/a&gt; about increased libido and harmful behaviour. GSK says a risk of "altered" sexual interest is also referred to in the leaflets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some of the women who described being drawn to risky sexual behaviour told us they had no idea of what was causing it. Others said they felt compelled to gamble or shop with no history of such activities. One accumulated debts of more than £150,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Like many women, Claire first developed RLS during her pregnancies. The relentless need to move was often accompanied by sleeplessness and a crawling sensation under her skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The condition persisted after giving birth and she was prescribed the dopamine agonist drug Ropinirole. She says she was not warned by doctors of any side effects. It initially worked wonders for her RLS, she says, but after a year or so she began feeling unprecedented sexual urges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The only way I could describe it is it was just deviant," she tells us - using that word without any knowledge of the GSK research which had established a link with such behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Picture of the GSK London headquaters.

She feels complete "shame" and is "mortified" at the danger she placed herself in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Impulsive behaviours, including gambling and increased sex drive, have long been listed as side effects in medicine leaflets for dopamine agonist drugs - and are thought to affect between 6% to 17% of RLS patients taking them, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/restless-legs-syndrome/prescribing-information/impulse-control-disorders/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;according to health guidance body NICE&lt;/a&gt;.

In one, a 63-year-old-man sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl, leading to a custodial sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The documents said the perpetrator's libido had increased significantly from the start of his treatment with Ropinirole and his "libido problem subsequently resolved" after his dose was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the second case, a 45-year-old man carried out "uncontrolled acts of exhibitionism and indecent behaviour". His sex drive was reported to have increased prior to being prescribed Ropinirole but his urges "intensified" after the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prevalence rates of what GSK calls "deviant" sexual behaviours caused by the drugs are unknown and tend to be under-reported by those who experience them, according to Valerie Voon, a professor of neuropsychiatry at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's a lot of stigma and shame attached to it, and people don't realise that it's associated with a medication," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Voon believes risky sexual behaviours - beyond a purely increased libido - should be specifically warned about and screened by the NHS, because their impact can be "devastating".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42441425" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;RLS is believed to affect&lt;/a&gt; about one in 20 adults - and women are about twice as likely to suffer as men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The 20 sufferers we spoke to say not only had doctors failed to tell them of the potentially serious side effects of the drugs, but also failed to review the impact of the medication on their bodies subsequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Sarah was in her 50s when she was prescribed another dopamine agonist drug made by a different manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Previously I'd have had no interest if Brad Pitt walked in the room naked," she says. "But it turned me into this raging woman who kept taking sexual addiction further."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Sarah began selling used underwear and videos of sex acts online - and organising telephone sex with strangers. She also began shopping compulsively - ending up with £30,000 of debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To combat the effects of the dopamine agonist, she began self-medicating by taking pain-relieving opioids and sleeping pills.

They said Ropinirole led to gambling debts and broken relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They also complained that despite a link between such behaviours and the drug having been established in medical studies as early as 2000, GSK had failed to include any warnings in its product literature until March 2007.

It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While there is no explicit reference to this side effect in patient leaflets, the UK medicines regulator told us there was a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.1160.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;general warning&lt;/a&gt; about increased libido and harmful behaviour. GSK says a risk of "altered" sexual interest is also referred to in the leaflets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some of the women who described being drawn to risky sexual behaviour told us they had no idea of what was causing it. Others said they felt compelled to gamble or shop with no history of such activities. One accumulated debts of more than £150,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Like many women, Claire first developed RLS during her pregnancies. The relentless need to move was often accompanied by sleeplessness and a crawling sensation under her skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The condition persisted after giving birth and she was prescribed the dopamine agonist drug Ropinirole. She says she was not warned by doctors of any side effects. It initially worked wonders for her RLS, she says, but after a year or so she began feeling unprecedented sexual urges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The only way I could describe it is it was just deviant," she tells us - using that word without any knowledge of the GSK research which had established a link with such behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Picture of the GSK London headquaters.

She ended up being admitted to rehab - but that meant her driving licence was taken away and she lost her job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I turned to things that weren't healthy - I knew that the behaviour wasn't me, but I couldn't control it," she tells the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-5c9c90b0-0 ggNdZQ"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-8d73edac-0 ezcCTE"&gt;&lt;b id="if-you-have-more-information-about-this-story,-you-can-reach-noel-directly-and-securely-through-encrypted-messaging-app-signal-on:-+44-7809-334720,-by-email-at-noel.titheradge@bbc.co.uk,-external-or-on-securedrop" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;If you have more information about this story, you can reach Noel directly and securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +44 7809 334720, by email at noel.titheradge@bbc.co.uk, external or on SecureDrop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A third woman, Sue, says she was prescribed two different dopamine agonist drugs without being warned of compulsive behaviour side effects on either occasion. She even mentioned recent gambling behaviour when the second drug was prescribed, she says. She went on to rack up debts of £80,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The effect on my family was horrific - it was life-changing money to lose," she says. "But at the time I didn't know it was no fault of my own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A class action was brought against GSK in 2011 by four sufferers of Parkinson's disease - the BBC has learned. They said Ropinirole led to gambling debts and broken relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They also complained that despite a link between such behaviours and the drug having been established in medical studies as early as 2000, GSK had failed to include any warnings in its product literature until March 2007. The class action was settled but GSK denied liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cases of serious side effects have also been reported in other countries, particularly in relation to the use of drugs for Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In France, a court awarded damages to a father of two who complained that Ropinirole had given him compulsive homosexual urges, while another man without a criminal record began torturing cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the US, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends the drugs should only be used for short-term treatment, such as end-of-life care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many of the women the BBC spoke to also complained that prolonged use of the drugs also worsened their underlying RLS. It meant their dosage had been increased which, in turn, had exacerbated their compulsive behaviour - a process known as augmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist, says the drugs still play an important role but he believes that drug companies, health authorities and doctors need to better warn patients of these side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Not everybody knows the kinds of really quite dramatic changes that can occur," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-5c9c90b0-0 ggNdZQ"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-8d73edac-0 ezcCTE"&gt;A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/actionline" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 kNHAVz"&gt;BBC Action Line.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In a statement, GSK told the BBC Ropinirole had been prescribed for more than 17 million treatments and undergone "extensive clinical trials". It added the drug had proven to be effective and had a "well-characterised safety profile".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"As with all medicines, [it] has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In response to its 2003 research that had found a link with "deviant" sexual behaviour, GSK told us this was shared with health authorities and had informed updates in prescribing information - which now lists "altered or increased sexual interest" and "behaviour of significant concern" as side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The current &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.1160.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;patient information leaflet for Ropinirole&lt;/a&gt; makes specific reference to changes in sexual interest on five occasions - almost exclusively warning about the frequency or strength of such feelings as potentially "abnormally high", "excessive" or "increase[d]".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said that while a specific reference to "deviant" sexual behaviour is not included in warnings, such impulses vary and a general warning about activities which may be harmful is included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It also said that it is important for healthcare professionals to explain the possible risk to patients and not all experience these types of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="some-names-have-been-changed-in-this-article-to-protect-people's-identities." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Some names have been changed in this article to protect people's identities.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 07:36:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1sSzBTdXBiZ2FSdWJqajZkVU9IcEhTLTRDMng0dEZJankxLTE2UFloRERvX09OUHIzdFlqWTJQRk1OZDFrM3kxNV9qTnNaeHdmMzBWLXpHYTlpdw</guid></item><item><title>Doctors didn't warn women of 'risky sex' drug urges - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXEFVX3lxTE8ya0ZZeGxWcmMyLUMxclBVZG8yeDliRnhVZ1NqVkVJVVMtMUVlVERyazhpN2NNOGN1UHRXUUdVRC0wam9PUW9Sdk1XVFBQSVlQbS1laXo0T0hpQ3g5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ssrcss-7uxr49-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi1"&gt;&lt;p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10"&gt;&lt;b class="ssrcss-1xjjfut-BoldText e5tfeyi3"&gt;Patients prescribed drugs for movement disorders - including restless leg syndrome (RLS) - say doctors did not warn them about serious side effects that led them to seek out risky sexual behaviour.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10"&gt;Twenty women have told the BBC that the drugs - given to them for RLS, which causes an irresistible urge to move - ruined their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10"&gt;A report by drugs firm GSK - seen by the BBC - shows it learned in 2003 of a link between the medicines, known as dopamine agonist drugs, and what it described as "deviant" sexual behaviour. It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10"&gt;While there is no explicit reference to this side effect in patient leaflets, the UK medicines regulator told us there was a &lt;a href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.1160.pdf" class="ssrcss-f6h2dj-InlineLink e1kn3p7n0"&gt;general warning&lt;span class="visually-hidden ssrcss-1f39n02-VisuallyHidden e16en2lz0"&gt;, external&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about increased libido and harmful behaviour. GSK says a risk of "altered" sexual interest is also referred to in the leaflets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10"&gt;Some of the women who described being drawn to risky sexual behaviour told us they had no idea of what was causing it. Others said they felt compelled to gamble or shop with no history of such activities. One accumulated debts of more than £150,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10"&gt;Like many women, Claire first developed RLS during her pregnancies. The relentless need to move was often accompanied by sleeplessness and a crawling sensation under her skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10"&gt;The condition persisted after giving birth and she was prescribed the dopamine agonist drug Ropinirole. She says she was not warned by doctors of any side effects. It initially worked wonders for her RLS, she says, but after a year or so she began feeling unprecedented sexual urges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10"&gt;"The only way I could describe it is it was just deviant," she tells us - using that word without any knowledge of the GSK research which had established a link with such behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 07:36:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE8ya0ZZeGxWcmMyLUMxclBVZG8yeDliRnhVZ1NqVkVJVVMtMUVlVERyazhpN2NNOGN1UHRXUUdVRC0wam9PUW9Sdk1XVFBQSVlQbS1laXo0T0hpQ3g5</guid></item><item><title>Why Are Cats Such a Medical Black Box? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5qX2NJb1pYNGZxNFBpUUNrdzl6YklQS0pxT2dyeGpURXdUZmI2dDhMdDRwWGh2Z3Y5bV9BT3RSb0Fjci02U3d2N0RXeW51bFNFTjhTMXBnR3Z2cFkweUNaOGQxSlBxWjcwRlh6WV9LcG40SGJpaklnNWlabUpHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-11rezm5 eoo0vm40" id="link-5b854369"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the United States, 1 in 3 households has a pet cat.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figure class="img-sz-small css-lt5b41 e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-13ytnnu ewdxa0s0"&gt;&lt;span class="css-14fe1uy e1z0qqy90"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0"&gt;Credit...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="false"&gt;Caroline Gutman for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-11rezm5 eoo0vm40" id="link-1db282b9"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But many aspects of feline health remain a mystery, even to experts.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figure class="img-sz-small css-lt5b41 e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-13ytnnu ewdxa0s0"&gt;&lt;span class="css-14fe1uy e1z0qqy90"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0"&gt;Credit...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="false"&gt;Octavio Jones for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-11rezm5 eoo0vm40" id="link-29366569"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when one of our kittens became critically ill last year, no one could explain why.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figure class="img-sz-small css-lt5b41 e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-13ytnnu ewdxa0s0"&gt;&lt;span class="css-14fe1uy e1z0qqy90"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0"&gt;Credit...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="false"&gt;Emily Anthes/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1lsv4am e6idgb70"&gt;pet theory&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1vkm6nb ehdk2mb0"&gt;&lt;h1 id="link-129ea5bd" class="css-1ebc1nn e1h9rw200" data-testid="headline"&gt;Why Are Cats Such a Medical Black Box?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-zera2v"&gt;&lt;div class="css-p6m5rf"&gt;&lt;div class="byline-container css-15ch0vu epjyd6m2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-233int epjyd6m1"&gt;&lt;p class="css-4anu6l e1jsehar1"&gt;&lt;span class="byline-prefix"&gt;By &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-anthes" class="last-byline css-ojhyzr e1jsehar0" itemprop="name"&gt;Emily Anthes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1gqes1i epjyd6m0"&gt;&lt;div id="enhanced-byline" class="css-8atqhb"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1hyokyd e1wtpvyy0"&gt;Emily Anthes is a science reporter who writes Pet Theory, a column about our creature companions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;time class="ep4cyha0 css-qtrd2v e16638kd0" datetime="2025-03-11T03:00:09-04:00"&gt;March 11, 2025&lt;/time&gt;&lt;hr class="css-7ad88g e1mu4ftr0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When my husband and I took our cat to the vet early last year, we were hoping to hear that we had nothing to worry about. Olive, a longhaired tortoiseshell kitten who had been the runt of her litter, was naturally quiet and skittish, prone to hiding in closets and napping behind the shower curtain. That made her hard to read — and sometimes simply to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But days earlier, we had started wondering whether she might be sick. Did she seem even more reserved than usual? It was hard to say, but we decided to ask her vet just to be safe. The vet immediately noticed that Olive’s gums were pale and that her heart was racing. A quick blood test revealed that she was severely anemic, with a blood-cell volume so low, the vet said, it was “incompatible with life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So began a monthslong ordeal featuring repeated visits to the veterinary I.C.U., more than a dozen blood transfusions and few solid answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Cats have been so understudied,” said Elinor Karlsson, a geneticist at UMass Chan Medical School and the Broad Institute. “They’re going to remain a black box unless something changes on the research side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-d45f77d"&gt;Dogs as the default&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Over the last few decades, veterinary medicine has made enormous strides, allowing pets like Olive to receive highly advanced care. But feline medicine has lagged behind its canine counterpart, and it is not always easy to provide evidence-based medicine for cats. “It’s still considered a bit of a niche interest,” said Dr. Karen Perry, a veterinary orthopedic surgeon with a focus on feline health at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 07:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5qX2NJb1pYNGZxNFBpUUNrdzl6YklQS0pxT2dyeGpURXdUZmI2dDhMdDRwWGh2Z3Y5bV9BT3RSb0Fjci02U3d2N0RXeW51bFNFTjhTMXBnR3Z2cFkweUNaOGQxSlBxWjcwRlh6WV9LcG40SGJpaklnNWlabUpHQQ</guid></item><item><title>Waking up between 2 and 3 am can be because of a spike in THIS hormone - WION</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxOZTJKa2QtSjRHMlBfb3NjcnNYOWNDdVRxN1JpQmJSd1RFSW15RTNwblRGYkFPd1ZMNmJFZjQtSDlzTDQ0NVFVcjJnVEJja1U0V3BhTXJ5MmVjYmw4Qm9yN0xsNlVYaGxMNWFIc0RoRkRmTWRqZDJfdEd1OTFMNE1ndWlxdXI3QkFaOTVuVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cookie-banner-content"&gt;
