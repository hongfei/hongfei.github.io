			&lt;p&gt;There's a parasite living in the brains of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-us-still-doesnt-test-for-this-common-harmful-parasite-during-pregnancy"&gt;40 million Americans&lt;/a&gt;, and most of these human hosts are completely unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors don't usually treat this bug unless it begins wreaking havoc on the bodies of patients with weakened immune systems, but a new discovery may make short work of the invader without the typical risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasitologist Rajshekhar Gaji runs a lab at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, investigating what makes the parasite, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cat-parasite-can-seriously-disrupt-brain-function-study-suggests"&gt;Cat Parasite Can Seriously Disrupt Brain Function, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The parasite that's sitting in the brain gets reactivated, starts multiplying, and then it's fatal," Gaji &lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/10/vetmed-research-parasite.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. "Because of that, the parasite is a dreaded pathogen." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;is closely associated with cats, which are the only known hosts within which the parasite can reproduce sexually. But once its offspring are shed in the cat's poop, there are very few warm-blooded species &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; won't make a home in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of us, an infection with &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;will fall &lt;span&gt;completely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;under the radar. For those with cancer, HIV, or who are on immunosuppressants, the parasite presents significant risks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a healthy immune system to keep &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;at bay, these patients can quickly develop a disease known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis"&gt;toxoplasmosis&lt;/a&gt;, which can bring flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, and brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite can also be transmitted to the placenta of a developing fetus during pregnancy. This form of the disease, congenital toxoplasmosis, can cause developmental problems, and even miscarriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments for acute toxoplasmosis involve medications that target mechanisms in the parasite that are biologically similar to processes in our own bodies. This often puts patients at risk of severe side effects, restricting treatments to situations where infections are considered to be dire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaji and his team might have found a lead, though: in a new study, they&lt;span&gt; have shown that switching off just a single protein inside the microscopic parasite can kill it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein, &lt;span&gt;TgAP2X-7, appears to be essential to the parasite's ability to invade a host, form plaques, and self-replicate. To prove this, the team genetically modified some parasites so that their TgAP2X-7 proteins function normally unless &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxin"&gt;auxin&lt;/a&gt; (a plant hormone that regulates growth) is added, in which case the proteins would quickly degrade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Auxin, they established prior, had no impact on &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;growth or plaque formation on its own, so any effect it had on the genetically modified parasites could be attributed to the fact that the TgAP2X-7 proteins had been destroyed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deprived of &lt;span&gt;TgAP2X-7, the parasites couldn't form plaques, and their ability to invade hosts (which, in this lab study, were human foreskin cells) was severely impaired. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Usually, they have a near-100 percent success rate invading these kinds of cells, but without that key protein, success dropped to below 50 percent. They also struggled to replicate.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178106" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-642x256.jpg" alt="Scientists Have Found The Protein Switch That Drives Widespread Brain Parasite" class="wp-image-178106 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-642x256.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-1200x478.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-768x306.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-1536x612.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-600x239.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004.jpg 1877w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178106" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Strains that had their TgAP2X-7 destroyed (B) were unable to propagate at the same rate as those with the protein intact (A).

So it is troubling that multiple studies suggest men’s testosterone levels are tanking worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; traced a “substantial” drop in men’s testosterone levels since 1987, at a rate of 1% each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another paper in &lt;em&gt;European Urology Focus&lt;/em&gt; found that 20% of younger men now have low testosterone levels. What is happening? And is this cause for mass male panic?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern men – particularly athletes with a keen interest in physical performance – deserve an urgent hormonal health update, beginning with a clarification of why testosterone matters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving growth through early life, in adulthood it supports everything from sperm production to red blood cell creation, muscle strength, bone density, memory performance and energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-1124672639.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945056"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Testosterone helps red blood cell production – crucial to endurance athletes such as cyclists. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A worldwide drop, then, is bad news for men’s health, with studies linking it to heart problems, obesity, high cholesterol, diabetes, anaemia, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, erectile dysfunction, infertility and sleep disturbances, plus mental issues such as irritability, low energy, poor self-esteem and weak concentration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, low testosterone is now associated with a 35-40% higher risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explanations for this disturbing global decline range from the ageing population to sedentary jobs and the side-effects of drugs such as antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But almost all experts agree the drop is linked primarily to unhealthy modern lifestyles and the rise in obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminal European Male Ageing study found that 2.1% of men aged 40-79 suffer from medically low testosterone (low enough to require treatment), but another 20% experience sub-optimal testosterone levels (not low enough to require medical treatment, but still likely to impair their everyday health). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for most of those men, low testosterone was linked to existing health problems, such as obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It fits the narrative that worldwide we are overall less healthy than we were,” explains Dr Channa Jayasena, a specialist in reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The men with the lowest levels of testosterone tended to be the ones who are the least fit, who have obesity, who are on the most medications or who are most ill.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, for most modern men with low testosterone, the issue is the result – not the cause – of their other health problems. “To a certain extent, you can lower your chances of low testosterone by incorporating health promotion into your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In medical terms, low testosterone is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests and symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A normal level ranges from around 8-10 nmol/L (nanomoles per litre) of blood to 30-31nmol/L. And symptoms include fatigue, depression, anxiety, irritability, low libido, erectile dysfunction, reduced strength, night sweats and poor memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low testosterone can be caused by genetic conditions, injuries and hormonal disorders. But for most men, lifestyle factors appear to be the primary cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that men do experience a natural but harmless drop in testosterone as they age, at a rate of 2-3% per year, from the age of 30 onwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-2218546877.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945062"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Testosterone declines naturally (and harmlessly) with age, but early and more consequential drops need addressing. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the oft-cited media term ‘male menopause’ is misleading. All menstruating women experience the menopause, which involves a rapid decline in hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most men do not suffer from low testosterone, while most age-related hormonal changes are slow and inconsequential. “You shouldn’t expect to be the same man at 80 as you were at 18,” says Dr Jayasena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are one of the 2.1% of men who have medically low testosterone levels, help is available through the NHS in the form of testosterone injections, gels or patches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are among the 20% of modern men who have sub-optimal testosterone levels (low but not requiring medical intervention), positive lifestyle changes can help you get back on track. Here are 15 science-backed strategies to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blast belly fat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-1205492768.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945078"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Belly fat increases your chances of low testosterone. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that obesity is a major cause of low testosterone. That is because body fat contains an enzyme that converts testosterone into the female sex hormone, oestrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, one American research paper found that every one-point increase in a man’s Body Mass Index (BMI) is associated with a 2% decrease in testosterone. Gynecomastia – the medical term for ‘man boobs’ – is one sign of this hormonal imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes the solution pretty simple: from cutting down on saturated fats in your diet, to cranking up your fat-burning workouts, losing body fat can revitalise your testosterone levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reassuring study by the Endocrine Society found that when 900 overweight men shed weight, they slashed their chances of low testosterone by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lift dumbbells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifting weights will crank up your testosterone, according to a study in the Asian Journal of Sports Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-muscle compound movements such as squats and deadlifts are particularly effective, according to Pennsylvania State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lifting heavy weights at 80-85% of your one-rep max also works well, according to the University of Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the good news is that any weight training will help. A study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Human Reproduction&lt;/em&gt; found that even moderate-intensity weight training elevates testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the results can be fast: a Spanish study found that men who did strength training three days a week enjoyed elevated testosterone levels after just four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Crank up the cardio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Routine cardiovascular exercise will elevate your hormonal health and burn off testosterone-wrecking body fat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Japanese study found that men who engaged in aerobic exercise for up to 90 minutes per day, three times per week, experienced a rise in testosterone after just 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;HIIT your hormones hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/11-02-07CYP414_201123ss7254-scaled.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945085"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;High intensity turbo sessions are a recipe for testosterone building. &lt;span&gt;Steve Sayers/Our Media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interval training (HIIT), such as 10x 30-second sprints or sweaty indoor spin classes, will protect your hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/em&gt; found that three HIIT sessions a week spiked testosterone by 36% after only eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Follow the Mediterranean diet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite wacky claims in dark corners of the internet, there is no magic food ingredient that will boost your testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a healthy overall diet will protect your hormonal health. A study in &lt;em&gt;Current Research In Food Science&lt;/em&gt; found that men who adopted a Mediterranean diet significantly increased their testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on fruit, veg, whole grains, fish, lean meat and healthy fats such as olive oil, avocado and nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dodge inflammatory food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-1391487524.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945089"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Regular highly processed food is a testosterone killer. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect your testosterone by cutting down on inflammatory foods, such as processed foods, high-glycaemic-index food (such as refined carbohydrates) and saturated fat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; linked a high consumption of pastries, desserts and takeaways with low testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eat more oily fish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all fat is bad. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in salmon, mackerel and sardines, have been shown to help with testosterone synthesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fatty acids support cell membranes in the testes, where testosterone is produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t get too skinny&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endurance athletes beware: shifting excess body fat is good for your hormonal health, but turning yourself into a skeleton is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testosterone is produced from cholesterol, and severe calorie restriction will impair its production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study by the Universities of Worcester and Warwick found a strong link between low-fat diets and low testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Get some daily vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/CYP_bigride_Guernsey_-100-scaled.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945090"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Plenty of sun exposure means cyclists needn't worry about vitamin D levels. &lt;span&gt;Joseph Branston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news for cyclists and runners: several studies link outdoor exercise with healthy testosterone levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be because it boosts vitamin D – the ‘sunshine vitamin’ which is produced when skin is exposed to sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in the journal&lt;em&gt; Hormone and Metabolic Research &lt;/em&gt;has linked healthy vitamin D levels to higher testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over winter, consider using a supplement: a study in the &lt;em&gt;World Journal of Men’s Health&lt;/em&gt; linked vitamin D supplements with increased testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Zero in on zinc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc, an essential mineral found in red meat, poultry, beans, oats, eggs, nuts and grains, supports healthy testosterone production, which is why research in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; found low zinc levels are linked to a drop in testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most men can get enough zinc from a balanced diet. But consider a supplement if your diet is zinc-deficient: research suggests vegetarians and vegans are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cut back on booze&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad news for boozers: testosterone levels can drop within just 30 minutes of consuming alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian research found that heavy drinking disrupts the body’s hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity, and causes inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to a decline in testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick to the NHS guidelines of no more than 14 units (6 pints of 4% beer) per week. But the less, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eat more green leafy veg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your dinner plate greener. Cruciferous vegetables – such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale and brussels sprouts – contain the phytonutrient indole-3-carbinol (I3C), which helps the body eliminate estradiol – a testosterone-damaging oestrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Get 7-8 hours of sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testosterone and sleep are intertwined. Most testosterone release occurs during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a lack of sleep also releases the stress hormone cortisol, which blocks testosterone production. The University of Chicago found that men who got only five hours of sleep suffered a 10-15% drop in testosterone the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improve your sleep by sticking to a regular sleep routine: research in Andrology found that 7-8 hours per night is a healthy target for middle-aged men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Learn to chill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just a bad night’s kip that will mangle your testosterone levels: research in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Molecular Bioscience&lt;/em&gt; found stress also spikes the testosterone-hampering hormone cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whether you tune into classical radio or enjoy walks in the park, allocate dedicated time each day to soothing your frazzled mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t overtrain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise supports hormonal health, but don’t overdo it with extreme endurance training or excessive HIIT workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study in Andrology found that recreational athletes who trained 4-5 hours per week enjoy better hormonal health than elite athletes who train 4-5 days per week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always bank plenty of rest days: your hormones depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

When animals eat other animals, the heavier nitrogen-15 slowly builds up in their bodies. That means animals that eat meat have more nitrogen-15 than plant eaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In most Neanderthal specimens that have been analyzed, the nitrogen-15 content was higher than those measured in large carnivores, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/oldest-evidence-of-neanderthals-hunting-cave-lions-dates-to-48000-years-ago-punctured-bones-reveal" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/oldest-evidence-of-neanderthals-hunting-cave-lions-dates-to-48000-years-ago-punctured-bones-reveal"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cave lions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, cave hyenas or wolves," Bocherens told Live Science in an email. "The conclusion was that Neanderthals were 'more carnivore than the carnivores' (hypercarnivores)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he added, this interpretation is too simple. Nitrogen levels can vary depending on which animals Neanderthals ate, not just how much meat they consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/56678-woolly-mammoth-facts.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/56678-woolly-mammoth-facts.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Woolly mammoths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; consistently exhibit the highest nitrogen-15 levels among herbivores, probably due to the consumption of plants with high nitrogen-15 levels," Bocherens said. The data suggest that Neanderthals were predators that consumed a higher proportion of mammoths than they did of other carnivores in the ecosystem, Bocherens added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7466" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7466" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2025 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offered a different explanation for Neanderthals' unusually high nitrogen-15 levels: They may have eaten maggots, either by accident, in the process of eating rotting meat, or on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both rotting meat and especially maggots feasting on the rotting meat have high nitrogen levels and any Neandertal eating those foods regularly would have an isotopic signature that is off the charts," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/anthropology/faculty-staff/faculty-profiles/nowell-april.php" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/anthropology/faculty-staff/faculty-profiles/nowell-april.php" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;April Nowell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Paleolithic archaeologist and professor of anthropology at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could Neanderthals survive on a solely meat-based diet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="2d0e5b8e-eb3a-407e-8f72-b61e89a7c34a"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Archaeologists have found evidence that Neanderthals soaked, pounded and ground lentils, nuts and grasses at Shanidar Cave (pictured here) in what is now Iraq and Franchthi Cave in modern-day Greece. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: ISMAEL ADNAN via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="1e9c1f72-9a55-4eec-888e-745860bb5aa0"&gt;"They could not if they had a similar physiology as modern humans, which is likely," Bocherens said. "There is a need for dietary sources of energy." Eating too much protein without enough fat and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/51976-carbohydrates.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/51976-carbohydrates.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which supply most of our energy, can lead to a fatal condition known as protein poisoning or "rabbit starvation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their solution, scientists think, was fat. At one 125,000-year-old German site, researchers found evidence that Neanderthals systematically broke animal bones to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/human-evolution/125-000-year-old-fat-factory-run-by-neanderthals-discovered-in-germany" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/human-evolution/125-000-year-old-fat-factory-run-by-neanderthals-discovered-in-germany"&gt;&lt;u&gt;extract fat from bone marrow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Animal brains were another probable source of fat, Bocherens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When whole carcasses are consumed, including marrow and fat reserves, an animal-based diet is perfectly viable, Slimak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-c8fbee78-c345-4eaf-858d-2c6035142a8d" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="neanderthals-ate-more-than-meat-and-fat-3"&gt;Neanderthals ate more than meat and fat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="6a922547-94bd-426b-87ba-997b0ebac980"&gt;Neanderthals may have found creative ways to balance their nutrition.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/prostate-cancer-screening" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;USPSTF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;) currently recommends against routine PSA testing in this age group. The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in the blood, which can be a sign of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason for this recommendation is that prostate cancer often grows very slowly. Many older men are more likely to live with the disease rather than die from it. Treatments can also cause side effects such as urinary problems, fatigue, or sexual difficulties. According to the USPSTF, these harms may outweigh the benefits of detecting the disease early in older men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as men today are living longer and healthier lives, some experts believe these guidelines need updating. The last update was in 2018, and new recommendations are expected soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is &lt;keyword id="21207229" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Metastatic-prostate-cancer" source="Orion"&gt;metastatic prostate cancer&lt;/keyword&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metastatic prostate cancer is prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer usually begins in the prostate, a small gland in men that produces seminal fluid. In its early stages, the cancer is generally confined to the prostate and often grows slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the cancer becomes metastatic, it spreads to other areas of the body through the blood or lymphatic system. The most common sites for metastasis are the bones, lymph nodes, and sometimes the lungs or liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metastatic prostate cancer is more serious than localised cancer because it can affect other organs and cause symptoms such as bone pain, fatigue, urinary problems, and weight loss. Treatment usually focuses on slowing the cancer’s growth, managing symptoms, and extending life, rather than curing the disease, although recent advances in therapy are improving outcomes significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When should men over 70 be tested for prostate cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it is not routine, some men over 70 still have PSA tests. This usually happens after discussing the pros and cons with their doctor. Often, testing is done when symptoms appear, such as trouble urinating, tiredness, or bone pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Marc B. Garnick, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, explains that it is not uncommon to find advanced prostate cancer in older men through these tests. In many cases, the disease has already spread by the time symptoms appear. This highlights the importance of making screening decisions individually, based on a man’s overall health and life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What tests are done after a positive PSA result&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a PSA test suggests that cancer may be present, the next step is usually a prostate needle biopsy. This involves taking small samples of prostate tissue to check for cancer cells. Doctors also perform a digital rectal examination (DRE) to feel for any lumps or changes in the size or shape of the prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern imaging technology now plays an important role in diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can provide clear, detailed pictures of the prostate. This allows doctors to identify suspicious areas more accurately and take targeted biopsy samples. MRI-guided biopsies are becoming a preferred method because they improve accuracy and help avoid unnecessary procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Understanding how aggressive prostate cancer is&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once prostate cancer is confirmed, doctors study the cancer cells under a microscope to see how aggressive they are. This helps them understand how quickly the cancer may grow and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many years, doctors used the Gleason score to grade prostate cancer. This score ranges from 6 to 10, based on how abnormal the cells look. A score of 6 suggests a slow-growing cancer, while a score of 9 or 10 points to a more dangerous, fast-growing type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newer system now groups cancers into five Grade Groups. Grade Group 1 represents the least aggressive cancer, while Grade Group 5 represents the most aggressive form. This simpler system helps patients better understand their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors can also order genetic tests to look for inherited mutations, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. Men with these mutations are more likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer. These genes are also linked to breast and ovarian cancers, so results can have important implications for family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Detecting the spread of prostate cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out if prostate cancer has spread, doctors use imaging scans. In the past, CT scans and bone scans were commonly used to check the lymph nodes and bones. Today, more advanced tests like the PSMA scan are used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) scan is more sensitive and can find very small clusters of cancer cells that other scans may miss. This test looks for a protein that appears in large amounts on the surface of prostate cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on scan results, doctors classify the cancer as high-volume or low-volume metastatic disease, depending on how much it has spread. If only a few small areas of cancer are found, it is described as oligometastatic prostate cancer, which often responds better to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treatment options for metastatic prostate cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating metastatic prostate cancer usually involves combining several therapies to stop the cancer from growing and spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main approach is known as doublet therapy, which uses two different drugs that reduce or block testosterone. Testosterone is a hormone that prostate cancer cells need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reported by Harvard Health, the first drug, leuprolide (Lupron), stops the body from making testosterone. The second drug comes from a group known as androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs). These medicines, such as enzalutamide (Xtandi), darolutamide (Nubeqa), apalutamide (Erleada), or abiraterone (Zytiga), block testosterone from attaching to cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the disease continues to spread, doctors may add chemotherapy to create a stronger treatment known as triplet therapy. This approach combines hormonal and chemotherapy drugs to fight cancer on multiple fronts. Some men begin triplet therapy right away if their cancer is widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improving survival and managing health during metastatic prostate cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, metastatic prostate cancer was seen as a fatal condition. However, major progress in diagnosis and treatment has changed that outlook. Today, many men live 10 years or longer with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are also finding benefits in treating the prostate gland itself, even after cancer has spread. Radiating the prostate can slow disease progression and improve survival, which was not considered a standard option in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These advances have turned metastatic prostate cancer into a more manageable long-term condition rather than an immediate life-threatening illness. Before starting hormone-based treatments, doctors recommend a heart and cardiovascular evaluation. Hormonal therapies can increase the risk of heart problems, so it is important to monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, and overall heart health during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing these risks through regular check-ups, diet, and exercise can help patients stay healthier throughout their cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/lung-cancer-symptoms-on-fingers-finger-clubbing-nail-changes-and-other-warning-signs-that-could-indicate-serious-health-risks/articleshow/124780487.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Lung cancer symptoms on fingers: Finger clubbing, nail changes and other warning signs that could indicate serious health risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 06:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwJBVV95cUxQaE9rcks3aVNyZXpwdjhRd05yaThDMzZaeWl1WFZFZC12Qm1iS1MyN0dRdl8yOFRrXy1SQ1hQbUFKLWdNSjJXd2pyN1pmSGpWcjJlbVpvVmRaX1BXVDluRWtET09taThjbzl3bllwS3gwMWo5SzY4ZGp4MWZSc1ZvWU5BZzRfWUJRUFYtbXpLdWdvU3I0X243dUgtck5RamhOQ2p1cjYxZ09mN2ZFWElHRGlSaWVGUXhVUXFycWxyaFJGM3FyMDUtM21jUjQ0MkdPQ0FIMDhReTR6SkFBbk8xQUFOdGR1WnFMSXRTSmJ0d3hYeFp2NHFQVl9tRVA1ZXQtNERkdUNtY2tKOU16ZkxnaVZsQk5FZlVSMkg4dnoyTEFSMUE0Q2xlNFNNaXM1azJtSy1MNXV1cmM4OGZWR0JnTGs1WXdURDA</guid></item><item><title>以色列两岁儿童死于麻疹疫情-《耶路撒冷邮报》</title><link>https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-871616</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Jerusalem Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 06:03:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5BbWtDeHkxcGF4eE95cWpTaEVpMHZLeHZiTFhQWUVSNlFDX0gxS2YwcjhZcVpXdmljRERGZTBMRXRTWEZGR1Jsd3BxOFlXNUtDT1YwWkV2ck42em5XcF9Wc1BQQ184UU0</guid></item><item><title>维生素K ：被遗忘的维生素，让您的骨骼强壮，心脏安全-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/vitamin-k-the-forgotten-vitamin-that-keeps-your-bones-strong-and-heart-safe/articleshow/124815991.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K rarely makes health headlines, yet it plays a crucial role in keeping both your bones and heart strong. Beyond helping blood clot, it ensures calcium goes where it should, into your bones, not your arteries. Skipping your greens or fermented foods could quietly weaken this vital balance over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="29874155" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Vitamin-K-benefits" source="keywords"&gt;Vitamin K benefits&lt;/keyword&gt;: The hidden link between blood, bones, and the heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people know Vitamin K as the nutrient that stops bleeding when you get a cut. But doctors say it quietly does far more; it activates proteins that help calcium bind to bones instead of sticking to artery walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminK-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Vitamin K supports both blood clotting and calcium metabolism.

Over-frying or overcooking vegetables also destroys much of the vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term antibiotic use, liver disease, or fat-absorption disorders can further lower Vitamin K levels since it is fat-soluble and requires dietary fat for absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Common signs and symptoms of low Vitamin K&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe deficiency is rare, but mild insufficiency can appear as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Easy bruising or frequent nosebleeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow wound healing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weak bones or repeated fractures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early signs of arterial stiffness in older adults&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants are especially vulnerable, which is why newborns are given a Vitamin K injection to prevent bleeding disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Best natural food sources of Vitamin K&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;table class="redcator-table-advance"&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Food&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Vitamin K (µg per 100 g)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Type&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Spinach&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;483 µg&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;K₁&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Kale&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;390 µg&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;K₁&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mustard greens (sarson saag)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;260 µg&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;K₁&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Broccoli&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;140 µg&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;K₁&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Curd / Yogurt&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12 µg&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;K₂&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Paneer / Cheese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20–25 µg&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;K₂&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Natto (fermented soybeans)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1,000 µg&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;K₂&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Egg yolk&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30 µg&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;K₂&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a small amount of healthy fat, such as mustard or olive oil, to salads or greens improves absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Daily Vitamin K requirements for adults&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your vitamin K needs vary based on age and sex.

Newer anticoagulants such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran don't interact with vitamin K, but anyone on warfarin should always consult their doctor before making dietary or supplement changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin K and bone health: The missing link&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K works with Vitamin D and calcium to strengthen bones.

However, according to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/counting-steps-is-good-is-combining-steps-and-heart-rate-better-202504173095" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, that number wasn’t based on scientific research but originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. Recent studies suggest that even 4,000 to 7,000 steps per day can improve health and lower the risk of early death. While step counts are helpful, they don’t reflect the intensity or effort of activity. A brisk uphill walk can raise heart rate far more than a slow flat stroll, even if step counts are identical. This is why experts recommend combining step counts with heart rate measurements to get a more accurate picture of fitness and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Combining steps and heart rate: The science behind a new fitness metric&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40156587/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; explored whether combining heart rate and step data could offer a more accurate assessment of fitness and disease risk. The researchers developed a new measure called the daily heart rate per step (DHRPS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ratio combines two pieces of information easily collected by most smartwatches or fitness bands: your average daily heart rate and your average daily step count. To calculate your DHRPS, divide your heart rate by your step count. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart rate 80 bpm / 4,000 steps = 0.0200&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart rate 80 bpm / 6,000 steps = 0.0133&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this ratio, lower scores indicate better cardiovascular fitness, as they show your heart needs fewer beats to support your activity level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study found: Higher DHRPS means higher disease risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved nearly 7,000 participants, with an average age of 55, all wearing Fitbit devices that continuously tracked their heart rate and steps over five years, a total of more than 50 billion steps. When researchers compared participants’ DHRPS ratios with their health outcomes, they found strong associations between higher DHRPS scores and an increased risk of chronic diseases, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure (hypertension)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coronary artery disease and heart failure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stroke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with lower DHRPS values tended to report better overall health, while those with higher values performed worse on exercise stress tests, showing poorer endurance. In short, your DHRPS score could be a better indicator of how efficiently your heart supports physical activity than steps or heart rate alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding your DHRPS score and what it reveals about your heart and overall health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers categorised DHRPS results into three groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low: 0.0081 or lower (best cardiovascular fitness)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medium: between 0.0081 and 0.0147&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High: 0.0147 or higher (higher disease risk)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lower DHRPS score means your heart works more efficiently relative to your movement. For example, if your DHRPS drops from 0.0200 to 0.0133 after a few weeks of increased walking, that’s a sign your fitness is improving. However, it’s important to remember that this is a new and emerging measure. The study only shows correlation, not causation, meaning it can’t prove that improving your DHRPS will directly lower your risk of heart disease or diabetes. Moreover, the research primarily involved white female participants and didn’t compare DHRPS with established risk factors like cholesterol, smoking, or family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already wear a smartwatch or fitness tracker, calculating your DHRPS could give you a more complete view of your health and motivate you to move more efficiently. It’s a simple ratio, yet it may reveal how your heart and activity work together to influence long-term well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists still need more research to confirm its medical value, this approach reflects a key insight: fitness isn’t just about how far you move, but how your heart responds as you move. By monitoring both steps and heart rate, you can personalise your fitness journey and identify trends that might help prevent disease. In the end, whether you’re aiming for 5,000 or 10,000 steps, focus on staying active, maintaining a healthy heart rate, and making steady progress. The combination of movement and heart awareness could be your best step yet toward lasting health and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

You don’t need 15 supplements, cold plunges every morning, or to cut out every ‘bad’ food to protect your heart and stay young. You need to understand your body — and the root causes of why it’s slowing down, inflamed, or running on empty.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;‘Your body isn’t failing you. It’s trying to get your attention’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist highlighted that after over 20+ years in medicine, he has seen the same story repeat itself: “High-performing people, business owners, parents, athletes — running on caffeine, stress, and convenience, until their body finally says no more.” It is because people forget to find the root cause of their problems, Dr Bhojraj stressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, the cardiologist stressed that if you’re: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always tired, even after sleep. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiencing chest pressure, shortness of breath, or anxiety that feels ‘different’.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foggy, inflamed, or just not feeling like yourself anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using quick fixes to get through the day instead of actually healing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;He highlighted that all of these are not signs that your body is failing you; rather, it’s trying to get your attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The truth is, your heart health isn’t just about cholesterol or blood pressure. It’s about inflammation, hormones, gut health, sleep quality, stress response — all interconnected,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, he emphasised that it is essential to combine advanced diagnostics, personalised functional medicine, and decades of cardiology expertise to help people regain their vitality from the inside out. “Because health isn’t about doing more. It’s about doing what’s right for you,” the cardiologist said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

For many, the way their brains work means they struggle with tasks that require focus and planning, which, at the lower end, means daily stress and inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, it's a recipe for disaster.

The research found that both random noise and a non-random pure tone had similar effects on a brain activity measure linked to neural noise, which contradicts key assumptions of the prominent moderate brain arousal model. These findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251357074" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Attention Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have observed that listening to random auditory noise, like white or pink noise, can benefit cognitive functioning in individuals with ADHD or elevated traits of the condition. The moderate brain arousal model was proposed to explain this phenomenon. This model is built on two primary assumptions. First, it suggests that ADHD is associated with lower-than-optimal levels of internal neural noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it proposes that external random noise boosts this internal neural noise through a mechanism called stochastic resonance, improving the brain’s ability to process signals. However, these foundational ideas had not been sufficiently tested, particularly because most studies lacked a direct measure of neural noise or a proper non-random sound condition to isolate the effects of stochastic resonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joske Rijmen and her colleagues at Ghent University aimed to directly test these two core assumptions of the moderate brain arousal model. They designed an experiment to measure neural noise directly while participants listened to different types of sound. The researchers wanted to see if ADHD traits were indeed linked to lower neural noise at baseline. They also sought to determine if the effects of sound on brain activity were specific to random noise, as the theory of stochastic resonance would predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their investigation, the researchers recruited 69 neurotypical adults. Participants first completed the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, a questionnaire used to assess the number and frequency of symptoms associated with the condition. This allowed the scientists to examine ADHD as a spectrum of traits rather than a simple diagnostic category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant then underwent a resting-state electroencephalogram, a non-invasive procedure that records the brain’s electrical activity. While their brain activity was monitored, participants sat with their eyes closed for three distinct two-minute periods: one in silence, one while listening to continuous pink noise (a random signal), and one while listening to a continuous 100 Hz pure tone (a non-random signal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed the electroencephalogram data by focusing on a specific feature known as the aperiodic slope of the power spectral density. This measure reflects background brain activity that is not part of rhythmic brain waves and is considered a direct index of neural noise. A steeper slope in this measurement corresponds to less neural noise, while a flatter slope indicates more neural noise. By examining how this slope changed across the different sound conditions and in relation to participants’ ADHD traits, the scientists could test the predictions of the moderate brain arousal model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings presented a direct challenge to the model’s first assumption. During the silent condition, the researchers found a relationship between ADHD traits and the aperiodic slope. Individuals who reported more traits of ADHD tended to have a flatter slope. This finding suggests that they had more background neural noise, not less. The result is the opposite of what the moderate brain arousal model predicted and aligns with other recent studies that have also found evidence for increased neural noise in older children and adolescents with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also contradicted the model’s second assumption regarding the mechanism of stochastic resonance. When participants with elevated ADHD traits listened to pink noise, their aperiodic slope became steeper. This change signifies a reduction in their neural noise. This outcome is contrary to the model’s suggestion that random noise should increase neural noise in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most significantly, the researchers found that the non-random pure tone had a virtually identical effect on brain activity as the pink noise. Listening to the 100 Hz tone also led to a steeper aperiodic slope, or a decrease in neural noise, in participants with higher levels of ADHD traits. The fact that a non-random sound produced the same effect as a random sound strongly questions the idea that stochastic resonance, which requires a random signal, is the necessary mechanism behind the benefits of auditory stimulation. If stochastic resonance were the driving force, only the pink noise should have produced this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that an alternative explanation may be needed. Rather than relying on stochastic resonance, both types of sound might have a more general effect on brain arousal. This idea is more consistent with the state regulation deficit account of ADHD, which suggests that individuals with the condition have difficulty regulating their arousal levels to match situational demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to this view, any form of additional stimulation, not just random noise, could help modulate arousal to a more optimal state. The researchers also noted the puzzling observation that stimulation appeared to decrease brain arousal in individuals with higher ADHD traits. They speculate this might relate to difficulties these individuals have in achieving a truly restful state, and the continuous sound may have helped them to calm or regulate their brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has some limitations that the authors acknowledge. The research was conducted with neurotypical adults who varied in their traits of ADHD, so the findings need to be replicated in a group of individuals with a formal clinical diagnosis. Another point is that the brain activity was measured during a resting state, not while participants were engaged in a cognitive task where the benefits of noise are typically observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should explore whether these same brain activity patterns occur during tasks that require attention and focus. Investigating these effects in a clinical sample of people with diagnosed ADHD will be an important next step to confirm these conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251357074" target="_blank"&gt;Pink Noise and a Pure Tone Both Reduce 1/f Neural Noise in Adults With Elevated ADHD Traits: A Critical Appraisal of the Moderate Brain Arousal Model&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Joske Rijmen, Mehdi Senoussi, and Jan R.

							&lt;p&gt;There’s no shortage of supplements claiming to boost focus, sharpen memory, or keep your brain young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the truth. No pill can replace what real daily habits do for your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain isn’t a static organ. It’s constantly adapting, responding, and reshaping itself based on what you do, eat, think, and feel. Research in psychology shows that lifestyle choices have far greater effects on brain health than any supplement ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to protect your brain long-term, start with these nine powerful habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Get consistent, quality sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is your brain’s nightly reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you rest, your brain clears out waste, stores memories, and repairs connections that keep your thinking sharp. Skipping rest doesn’t just make you tired. It slows down attention, weakens focus, and makes emotional regulation harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies from the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-deprivation/health-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; show that even one night of poor sleep affects how your brain processes information. Over time, chronic sleep loss can contribute to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, treat sleep as non-negotiable. Aim for seven to eight hours every night. Keep your room dark, avoid screens before bed, and go to sleep at the same time each evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good sleep is free medicine for your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Move your body every day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the best things you can do for mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you move, your brain receives more oxygen and nutrients. Movement also releases neurochemicals that boost mood, sharpen focus, and help create new brain connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to train like an athlete. Even &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/k-if-you-commit-to-these-5-weekly-activities-youll-age-better-than-95-of-your-peers/"&gt;moderate activities&lt;/a&gt; like brisk walking, yoga, or cycling help your brain perform better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’ve found that going for a run in the morning clears mental fog faster than coffee. The rhythm of movement resets my thoughts and sets the tone for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise isn’t just about muscles or fitness. It’s brain fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Feed your brain nutrients it actually needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you eat has a direct impact on how you think and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research consistently links diet quality with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-024-00226-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;. The Mediterranean diet, for instance, is rich in omega-3s, antioxidants, and plant-based foods that protect brain cells from inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat more foods that support long-term brain health:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens like spinach and kale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berries for antioxidants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuts and seeds for healthy fats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whole grains for steady energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legumes for protein and fiber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who eats vegan, I’ve seen how clean energy from whole foods keeps my mind focused throughout the day. Processed foods, sugar, and alcohol, on the other hand, can make your brain sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to overhaul your diet overnight. Just make more choices that feed your mind instead of depleting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Keep learning new things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain loves novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning strengthens neural pathways and increases plasticity, which helps your mind stay flexible and creative. It doesn’t have to mean going back to school. Try reading new subjects, learning an instrument, or practicing a language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-8-signs-youre-far-more-capable-than-you-give-yourself-credit-for-according-to-psychology/"&gt;you challenge yourself&lt;/a&gt; to learn, your brain forms fresh connections. This process keeps it strong well into older age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned before that when I started diving into behavioral psychology, it completely changed how I viewed human decision-making. That mental challenge reignited my curiosity and made me realize how important lifelong learning really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you learn something new, your brain literally upgrades itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Spend time in nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65565" src="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50.png" alt="" srcset="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50.png 1600w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-300x158.png 300w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-1024x538.png 1024w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-768x403.png 768w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-1536x806.png 1536w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-1200x630.png 1200w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-857x450.png 857w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-900x473.png 900w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-420x221.png 420w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-840x441.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain wasn’t designed to stare at screens all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature helps it recharge. The sounds, colors, and movement of natural environments soothe the nervous system and improve focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that even short &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494425002713#:~:text=A%20consistent%20body%20of%20evidence,et%20al.%2C%202015)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;exposure to nature&lt;/a&gt; reduces stress hormones and restores attention. Just 20 minutes outdoors can improve cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to grab my camera and head to the nearest park when I need a reset. Observing light, trees, and patterns in nature always brings me back to the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a mountain trail to get the benefits. A walk around your block or sitting under a tree works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Practice mindfulness or meditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wandering mind is an anxious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness trains your brain to stay in the present, reducing stress and increasing clarity. Regular meditation strengthens the prefrontal cortex, which handles focus, decision-making, and self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to meditate for hours. Even five to ten minutes of quiet breathing or paying full attention to what you’re doing can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find traditional meditation difficult, try mindful walking, cooking, or simply taking a pause before responding to something stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calm attention is one of the most powerful habits for long-term brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Nurture real social connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings are wired for connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong relationships don’t just make you happier; they protect your brain. &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research from Harvard’s&lt;/a&gt; long-term adult development study shows that meaningful social ties are one of the strongest predictors of both happiness and cognitive longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness, on the other hand, has been linked to memory loss and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make time for friends, family, or even small daily interactions with neighbors or coworkers. The conversations you have, the laughter you share, and the empathy you give all stimulate your brain’s social and emotional circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make a point to call a friend or grab coffee with someone at least once a week. It’s not about networking or small talk. It’s about staying human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain thrives when it feels connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8) Manage your stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress is unavoidable, but chronic stress is harmful to your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term exposure to cortisol, the body’s stress hormone, can damage neurons in the hippocampus, which is responsible for memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-the-art-of-staying-calm-7-habits-of-people-who-never-lose-their-cool/"&gt;Managing stress&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t mean eliminating challenges. It means giving your brain space to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try breathwork, physical activity, time outdoors, or any routine that helps you slow down. I like to end my evenings by putting my phone away, having tea, and reading a few pages of a good book. It tells my brain it’s time to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance is what keeps your brain resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9) Get comfortable with boredom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world full of constant stimulation, boredom has become rare. Yet it’s one of the healthiest states for creativity and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your brain isn’t flooded with information, it activates what neuroscientists call the “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/default-mode-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;default mode network&lt;/a&gt;,” which helps you process experiences and form new insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of your best ideas come when you stop trying to have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So resist the urge to reach for your phone every time you feel restless. Sit in silence. Let your mind wander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boredom gives your brain space to connect dots you didn’t even know were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need supplements to protect your brain. You need consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These nine habits might sound simple, but they work because they align with how your brain naturally thrives. Sleep, movement, learning, calmness, and connection — these are what keep your mind strong for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you care for your brain daily, you’ll notice the difference not just in how well you think, but in how fully you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it one day at a time, and your brain will thank you for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

'I just had this weird feeling.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For peace of mind, Porter and her husband, Jeff Huber, asked doctors to perform an MRI of Brody's brain, assuming the scan would come up clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, images revealed a rare and aggressive brain tumor. Eight months later, Brody was dead at 14 years old.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brody Huber, pictured here, was diagnosed in 2020 at age 13 with diffuse midline glioma (DMG), an extremely aggressive brain tumor most often diagnosed in children. Most patients die within a year, and 99 percent survive less than five years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few days after that June MRI, Porter said doctors called her and asked: 'Are you sitting down?' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They told Porter there was a 'significant tumor' nestled in Brody's brain and urged the mom-of-two to immediately pack a bag and bring Brody to Children's Hospital Colorado in neighboring Aurora. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The once-athletic teenager was so tired he slumped over as his mother and brother tried to help him out the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was like, "Oh my god. This is really real,"' Porter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jeff, who works as a physician's assistant, saw on the scan 'what a dad should never see in his kid's head.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MRI had revealed 'a pretty significant tumor' that had wrapped around Brody's thalamus, a structure in the middle of the brain that controls motor function such as walking and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A biopsy of the tumor two days later revealed Brody had a diffuse midline glioma (formerly called a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma), an extremely aggressive brain tumor most often diagnosed in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fewer than 500 Americans are diagnosed with diffuse midline glioma (DMG) every year, and it makes up one in five of all pediatric brain tumors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients generally only live for less than a year after diagnosis. According to the American Brain Tumor Association, 99 percent of patients diagnosed with DMG die within five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brody was given six to nine months.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is no stage. This is the worst of the worst,' Porter said doctors told her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brody (pictured second from the left, between his mother Tina Porter and brother Griffin) had always been extremely active, but red flags were raised when he began struggling with headaches and fatigue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brody, pictured here, had insisted on taking the stairs after his cancer treatments, his mother told the Daily Mail, until he physically could no longer walk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like most DMGs, Brody's tumor was inoperable because it was so delicately intertwined in the thalamus that operating could have left him with permanent brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, he underwent six weeks of radiation, along with traditional Eastern therapies including meditation, acupuncture, massage and Reiki, a Japanese form of energy healing that involves placing one's hands on or just above a person's body and redirecting energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Porter said: 'I was like, we're going to do everything that we can, and he is going to be the poster child for this disease. You don't know Brody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You don't know what we're capable of. This is not how his story is supposed to end.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few months later, Brody was accepted into a clinical trial at the Vitanza Lab at Seattle Children's Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Led by pediatric neuro-oncologist Dr Nick Vitanza, the trial involved surgically implanting a dome-shaped device called an Ommaya reservoir under a DMG patient's scalp to allow doctors to inject medication directly into the cerebrospinal fluid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients in the trial underwent chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, a type of immunotherapy that uses a patient's own immune cells to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family flew to Seattle in December 2020 so doctors could collect Brody's red blood cells and begin modifying them before he could start the trial in March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jeff Huber, Brody's father, is pictured above hugging him. Brody died of DMG on March 8, 2021, at 14 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brody (second from the right) was set to begin a clinical trial at Seattle Children's Hospital but died eight days beforehand &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But an MRI scan in February 2021 showed Brody's brain 'was like a sponge that had soaked up all of his cancer,' Porter said. The disease had spread throughout his brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was just getting worse and worse,' she added. 'And that was when doctors said there was nothing else they could do.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brody would not be able to join the clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As they left the doctor's office, Brody's legs buckled underneath him. The kid who had insisted on taking the stairs early on in his treatment now needed a wheelchair to take him home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I really thought I had it, Mom,' Porter told the Daily Mail her son had said to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brody died about a month later on March 8, 2021, eight months after his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His death came eight days before he was scheduled to start the clinical trial in Dr Vitanza's lab. Porter later found out that a boy named Levi took his place, and the child lived nine months longer than expected after participating in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And there have been more kids with that same tumor that are still alive,' Porter said. 'Whatever they're doing at the Vitanza Lab, they're saving kids' lives.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brody's family set up the Brody Huber Foundation after his death to raise money for the Vitanza Lab at Seattle Children's Hospital, which is conducting clinical trials for children with DMG &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, Dr Vitanza's team &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03451-3"&gt;published the results of the phase I clinical tria&lt;/a&gt;l, which found the CAR-T cell therapy was well-tolerated in 21 patients who were just six years old on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children lived an average of 20 months after diagnosis, nearly twice as long as the average 11 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And three patients studied were still alive four years after diagnosis, a previously unthinkable feat.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brody personally decided before his death to donate his entire brain and spine to science for research, and in the months after, his family started the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://brodyhuberfoundation.org/"&gt;Brody Huber Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which has raised $85,000 to date to help fund the Vitanza Lab's research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On November 21, 2025, which would be Brody's 19th birthday, the foundation is hosting its annual fundraiser with the goal of sending another $50,000 to the Vitanza Lab to take steps toward finding a cure for DMG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Porter told the Daily Mail: 'Brody didn't want others to suffer.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;Rates of one type of breast cancer — invasive lobular carcinoma — have been rising in the United States more than three times faster than those of all other breast cancers combined over the past decade, according to a new study.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This elusive breast cancer that’s hard to spot in routine mammograms is behind more than 1 in 10 cases nationwide.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The research, published in Cancer, the journal of the American Cancer Society, analyzed national data from 2012 to 2021 and found that rates of invasive lobular carcinoma increased by about 2.8% each year, while rates of all other breast cancer rose by about 0.8% a year.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What exactly is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it? How is it diagnosed, and why can it be more difficult to find during screenings? Who is most at risk? What are the treatment options? And what should women know about reducing their risk of developing this and other types of breast cancer?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Dr Leana Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Invasive lobular carcinoma, also known as ILC or lobular breast cancer, is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands of the breast, called lobules, and then spreads into nearby tissue. These malignant tumors are often hormone receptor-positive, meaning the cancer cells grow in response to estrogen or progesterone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
ILC is the second most common type of breast cancer, after invasive ductal carcinoma, and accounts for 10% to 15% of all new breast cancer diagnoses, according to the National Cancer Institute. About 47,500 ILC cases are diagnosed in the US each year, and more women are diagnosed with it than with brain, kidney, liver, pancreatic or ovarian cancer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: Why is ILC often more difficult to find with routine mammograms?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: This type of tumor tends to grow in a way that doesn’t change the breast’s structure as much as other cancers. Instead of forming a defined mass, the cancer cells spread through the tissue in thin strands that appear more like normal breast tissue on imaging. Because of this, mammograms may show only subtle changes, or sometimes none at all. Women may also be less likely to feel a distinct lump during a breast self-exam, which can delay detection.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What other imaging is used to diagnose ILC?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: A breast ultrasound can help spot areas of thickened tissue that don’t show up on a mammogram, and a breast MRI provides a more detailed view that can reveal cancers hidden in dense breast tissue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These tests aren’t routinely recommended for everyone. Mammography remains the standard screening tool for most women. But those at higher risk, including women with dense breasts and those with a strong family history of breast cancer or known genetic mutations, may be advised to have an ultrasound or MRI in addition to regular mammograms.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What does this study show in terms of the rise of cases and who is most at risk?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Researchers found that ILC has been increasing across every racial and ethnic group, but the steepest rise was seen among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, whose incidence grew by about 4.4% each year in the study period. Age is also a risk factor, as women 65 and older are more likely to be diagnosed with ILC than with invasive ductal carcinoma. About 70% of new ILC cases were diagnosed in women 60 and older; the median age of diagnosis is 66.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: How do the study authors explain the rise especially in this type of breast cancer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Several factors may be driving this greater increase. Because ILC is strongly linked to hormones, changes in hormone exposure over time could be part of the reason. Rising rates of obesity and alcohol use, along with changes in childbearing and menopause patterns, may also contribute to the steady increase.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Improvement in diagnosis and greater awareness of ILC may be leading to more accurate identification. Some lobular cancers may have been misclassified as ductal cancers in the past, so part of the rise may reflect better recognition. In addition, more women are living longer after menopause, which can increase the likelihood of developing ILC compared with other types of breast cancer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What are the treatment options for ILC?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Treatment is similar to that for other breast cancers. Surgery to remove the tumor, followed by radiation, is common, as is hormonal therapy, since most tumors grow in response to estrogen or progesterone. Chemotherapy may be used in some cases. For advanced disease, newer targeted drugs combined with hormonal therapy can help slow progression and improve outcomes. However, ILC may have greater resistance to treatment, especially in more advanced disease, and tends to carry a poorer prognosis once it has spread.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: How can women reduce their risk of developing ILC and other types of breast cancer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Some risk factors can’t be changed, such as age or family history, but many lifestyle choices can make a difference. Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active all help lower the risk of breast cancer. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains supports overall health and may reduce inflammation linked to cancer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Regular screening and knowing what’s normal for your breasts are key for early detection. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors and decide together when you should begin screening and whether you need tests in addition to a mammogram.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Finally, pay attention to changes in your breasts, such as thickening, swelling, nipple discharge, different colors or new areas of fullness, and seek medical evaluation as soon as something looks or feels different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GhanaWeb</author><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 15:37:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxQYldXWlJuZ0J5SlhfSnRIckVvUE5IRU1SbHprQjZoaWJFMXZMeEJ1bmNySlZua3N3V3ZYZW1rN0RIQkVYM3dmbk1zaWNDMXRZMFdLTkpPVTFqdW4zbHR4VWlrRVhLV0VIU29XTWZ2d0dMbWJUUUVpbWktUm51WU5jeUl0dnUtU1c1Ny1GbFFGekRrWWxvaXE3dGVhWEV2b1Z6RDJDUXdRMDh5aTZEQXJsNzdUeThJX3F6dGM2bEFQelFYSHFqOFlPd0RReGNfQjVNR1ZyZg</guid></item><item><title>科学家们刚刚发现了白发与癌症之间令人惊讶的联系-科学日报</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251025084553.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Throughout life, our cells are continually exposed to both internal and external influences that can harm DNA. This DNA damage is a well-known factor in the development of aging and cancer, yet scientists have long struggled to understand the exact link -- especially how DNA-damaged stem cells affect tissue health over time.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) are specialized cells that give rise to melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells responsible for the color of our hair and skin. In mammals, these stem cells are found in a region of the hair follicle known as the bulge-sub-bulge area. Here, they exist as immature melanoblasts, ensuring that hair and skin maintain their color through repeated cycles of regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovering How DNA Damage Drives Hair Graying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published online on October 6, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;, a study led by Professor Emi Nishimura and Assistant Professor Yasuaki Mohri at The University of Tokyo explored how McSCs react to different types of DNA damage. Using long-term lineage tracing and gene expression profiling in mice, the researchers discovered that when McSCs experience DNA double-strand breaks, they undergo a process known as senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation). In this state, the stem cells permanently mature and are eventually lost, which leads to hair turning gray. The process is controlled by the activation of the p53-p21 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When McSCs are exposed to certain carcinogens, including 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene or ultraviolet B radiation, they do not follow the same protective path. Even with DNA damage present, these cells avoid seno-differentiation and continue to renew themselves. They expand clonally instead, aided by KIT ligand signals released from surrounding tissue and the epidermis. These niche-derived signals block the protective differentiation response, pushing the stem cells toward a cancer-prone state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opposing Cellular Fates: Graying or Cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Nishimura, "These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates -- exhaustion or expansion -- depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals." She adds, "It reframes hair graying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that their findings do not imply that developing gray hair prevents cancer. Instead, seno-differentiation appears to serve as a stress-triggered defense mechanism that removes damaged stem cells before they can become harmful. When this safeguard fails or is bypassed, those damaged cells can survive and potentially lead to melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linking Aging, Cancer, and Cellular Self-Destruction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By uncovering the molecular pathways that determine whether stem cells undergo protective exhaustion or dangerous expansion, this study connects the biology of tissue aging with cancer formation. It also highlights the value of naturally removing compromised stem cells through "senolysis," a biological process that helps prevent cancer by sacrificing cells that could otherwise become malignant.&lt;/p&gt;

The answer lies in interoception, a lesser-known process through which the nervous system constantly monitors the body's internal signals to keep essential functions running.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a collaborative team from Scripps Research and the Allen Institute has received the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Transformative Research Award to develop the first comprehensive atlas of this internal sensory system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Major Investment in Brain-Body Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading the project is Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist Ardem Patapoutian, joined by Li Ye, the N. Paul Whittier Chair in Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Scripps Research, and Bosiljka Tasic, Director of Molecular Genetics at the Allen Institute. Xin Jin, Associate Professor at Scripps Research, will serve as co-investigator, directing the genomic and cell-type identification work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH has awarded the team $14.2 million over five years to carry out this ambitious project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My team is honored that the NIH is supporting the kind of collaborative science needed to study such a complex system," says Patapoutian, the Presidential Endowed Chair in Neurobiology at Scripps Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patapoutian, who shared the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of cellular sensors that detect touch, will now apply his expertise to understanding interoception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We hope our results will help other scientists ask new questions about how internal organs and the nervous system stay in sync," adds Ye. Like Patapoutian, he's also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established in 2009, the Transformative Research Award funds groundbreaking interdisciplinary projects that push beyond traditional scientific boundaries. It is part of the NIH Common Fund's High-Risk, High-Reward Research Program, designed to support innovative ideas that could reshape our understanding of human health but might otherwise struggle to receive funding through conventional mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes Interoception Unique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the classic senses -- such as smell, sight, and hearing -- which rely on specialized sensory organs that detect stimuli from the outside world, interoception involves a vast network of neurons that sense what's happening inside the body. These neural circuits track critical processes including circulation, digestion, and immune activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because interoceptive signals originate deep within the body and are often processed unconsciously, scientists often describe this system as our "hidden sixth sense."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its fundamental role, interoception has received little scientific attention. The signals it produces are complex, overlapping, and difficult to measure. The sensory neurons that carry them are distributed throughout organs such as the heart, lungs, stomach, and kidneys, making them hard to isolate and map precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping the Brain-Body Connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the NIH's support, the Scripps and Allen Institute researchers plan to map how sensory neurons connect with a wide variety of internal organs, including the heart and gastrointestinal tract. Their goal is to create a detailed anatomical and molecular atlas that reveals how these neural pathways are organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, one part of the project will label sensory neurons and use whole-body imaging to trace their routes from the spinal cord to different organs, producing a high-resolution 3D map. The second part will use genetic profiling to distinguish between different cell types, such as neurons that send signals from the gut, bladder, or fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these datasets will form the first standardized reference for understanding the body's internal sensory wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Interoception Matters for Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By decoding how interoception works, scientists hope to uncover key principles of brain-body communication that could lead to new treatments for disease. Disruptions in these internal sensory pathways have been linked to a range of conditions, including autoimmune disorders, chronic pain, neurodegenerative diseases, and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Interoception is fundamental to nearly every aspect of health, but it remains a largely unexplored frontier of neuroscience," says Jin, who's a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Freeman Hrabowski Scholar. "By creating the first atlas of this system, we aim to lay the foundation for better understanding how the brain keeps the body in balance, how that balance can be disrupted in disease and how we might restore it."&lt;/p&gt;

The device is the first of its kind to bring back functional sight, albeit blurry and only black and white, to patients with this type of incurable vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="Inline-1" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palanker and his international colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501396" data-link="native" class=""&gt;published the results&lt;/a&gt; from their clinical trial on Oct. 20 in the New England Journal of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised that patients could see so well — that was unpredictable,” Palanker told SFGATE. “Until this implant, people tried retinal prosthetics many times, resulting in just light perception but not form vision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0 ruduv2y"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scientist examines the prototype glasses in the lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advanced form of macular degeneration, called geographic atrophy, causes people to lose sight over time. It’s most commonly found in &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/geographic-atrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20582973" data-link="native" class=""&gt;people over 60&lt;/a&gt; and can cause irreversible blindness, affecting over &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501396" data-link="native" class=""&gt;5 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide — and an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11695844/#:~:text=BACKGROUND%3A,in%20at%20least%201%20eye." data-link="native" class=""&gt;estimated 1 million&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. The condition destroys photoreceptor cells in the retina, the neural tissue in the back of the eye responsible for transforming light into electrical signals for the brain. Many people keep their peripheral vision, though they often become &lt;a href="https://afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/eye-conditions/low-vision-and-legal-blindness-terms-and-descriptions" data-link="native" class=""&gt;legally blind&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new device has two parts that talk to each other: an implanted chip and special glasses. The glasses — a prototype which Palanker admits is a “little awkward-looking” —  have an attached camera that captures images and then projects them, via infrared light, to the chip. Meanwhile, the 2-by-2-millimeter chip — implanted into the patients’ damaged retinas — converts those images into electrical stimulation, restoring sight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0 ruduv2y"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to a household key, the chip pales in size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 32 participants who completed the clinical trial — all older than 60 and with sight worse than &lt;a href="https://www.nvisioncenters.com/improve-eyesight/20-100-vision-and-up/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;20/320&lt;/a&gt; in at least one eye. Once they had the new technology, some could make out patterns immediately, while it took others months of training before their sight improved. A year after receiving the device, the vast majority — 27 people — had regained the ability to read, though they could only see a few letters at a time. With their artificial retinas, some could read with 20/42. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen trial participants experienced side effects, such as pressure, tears and bleeding — though most of these issues resolved within two months. Two-thirds of the participants reported medium to high user satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheila Irvine, who is registered blind at age 70, expressed her joy at being able to read and do crosswords again to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qpz39jpj7o" data-link="native" class=""&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;: “It’s beautiful, wonderful. It gives me such pleasure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is certainly an important development,” said Dr. &lt;a href="https://ophthalmology.ucsf.edu/jacque-duncan-md/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Jacque Duncan&lt;/a&gt;, a distinguished professor of ophthalmology and the department chair at UC San Francisco, who was not involved in this research. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;There are existing treatments to try and prevent vision loss — but once vision has been lost, there aren’t really any treatments to bring vision back for people with this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists hope to make the new technology available outside of the lab. Science Corp., based in Alameda, recently bought the assets of Pixium Vision SA, which originally developed the device before going out of business. Science Corp. has submitted the paperwork necessary to sell the device in Europe. Palanker is also exploring a pathway to bring it to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0 ruduv2y"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an up-close view of the implant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palanker is not finished inventing, however. He is developing software that could enable patients to see not only black and white but also shades of gray — a key aspect of face recognition. He’s also working on the next generation of chips that would enable higher resolution vision, getting people closer to 20/20, and a pair with sleeker glasses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was huge excitement and relief, since I didn’t know what to expect until the clinical trial,” Palanker said. “I’m very happy to see that the results were consistent, with almost all patients having a very similar performance. It wasn’t a one-off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 15:09:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQa1ZKRVFrXzEzVHlKWnQ3Q0UxMGtsLWdLTWFuZVkxbEJjSXUybVNzZVdILVVQOFoycUppSVVyQ2FJZE1SRnl3VVRyLV9pMTRTOTNwOHJQTFlBMEJMUFZvYThLTUVtbFh3MGRBcHo0aG1ScXRweTdpNGd1SXk0b1Z4Z3JWLVlMT2FEUEVScDhn</guid></item><item><title>5种有助于强化肝脏并改善其功能的日常食物-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/5-everyday-foods-that-can-help-strengthen-the-liver-and-improve-its-function/photostory/124803832.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our liver is the largest internal organ of the body, that performs as many as 500 essential functions! Yes, that is right. These include filtering blood, processing nutrients, producing bile, regulating blood clotting, and detoxifying the body, apart from many others. Sometimes, the liver becomes weak and sluggish, resulting in many conditions. These could occur due to poor lifestyle, alcohol, accidents, or others. Hence, it is important to take care of our liver, and here are 5 everyday foods, that do just that, backed by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7780776/"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;.
