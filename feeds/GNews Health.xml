This marks the country’s largest chikungunya outbreak since the virus was first identified there in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="193"&gt;Here is what we know about the disease and how it is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-chikungunya-virus" data-start="0" data-end="193"&gt;What is the chikungunya virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. These mosquitoes also carry and spread dengue, yellow fever and the Zika virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name, chikungunya, derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, spoken in Tanzania and Mozambique, meaning “to become contorted”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In most cases, patients will feel better within a week. In many cases, however, the joint pain can last for months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for the chikungunya virus, but deaths are rare. If an infected mosquito bites a healthy human, it injects the virus into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="55" data-end="214"&gt;People most at risk of serious illness from chikungunya include newborns, older adults and those with existing health problems such as heart disease or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="216" data-end="268"&gt;There is no cure for the chikungunya virus, but the death rate is low, except in high-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="216" data-end="268"&gt;If an infected mosquito bites a healthy human, it injects the virus into the bloodstream. If a non-infected mosquito bites a person who is already infected, it sucks the virus from that person’s blood and becomes a carrier capable of transmitting the virus to others through bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3270421 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-01-1729771918.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-transmission" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-bad-is-the-current-spread-of-the-virus"&gt;How bad is the current spread of the virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the current surge in cases began in early 2025, with major outbreaks in Indian Ocean Islands, including La Reunion, Mayotte and Mauritius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In La Reunion, more than 47,500 cases of chikungunya and 12 associated deaths were reported up to May 2025, with sustained high transmission across the island, according to the WHO. The ECDC also reports that as of July 18, there were more than 54,000 cases reported from La Reunion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is now the most serious chikungunya outbreak in La Reunion since the 2005–2006 epidemic, which saw an estimated 244,000 to more than 300,000 cases, and prompted large-scale public health efforts to control mosquito breeding and limit transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has also spread to other countries, including Madagascar, Somalia and Kenya, and has shown signs of epidemic-level transmission in parts of Southeast Asia, as well as India, where financial capital Mumbai has seen a surge in cases since July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has also raised concerns about the rising number of imported chikungunya cases in Europe. Since May 1, about 800 imported cases have been reported in mainland France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the ECDC, the Americas as a region have reported the highest number of chikungunya cases globally. As of mid-July 2025, the countries with the most cases in the region include Brazil (185,553), Bolivia (4,721), Argentina (2,836) and Peru (55).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, infections have been reported in at least 12 cities across southern Guangdong province, in addition to Foshan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities said that an “imported case triggered local transmission” in July, but did not specify where the infection originated. According to experts, rising global temperatures have led to warmer and wetter weather, allowing mosquitoes to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, on Saturday, Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/02/P2025080200897.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; its first case of chikungunya: a 12-year-old boy who developed a fever, rash and joint pain since July 31, after visiting Foshan. This was the territory’s first case of the virus in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3270415 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-02-1729771842.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-symptoms" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-are-china-and-other-countries-fighting-the-spread"&gt;How are China and other countries fighting the spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-start="138" data-end="270"&gt;According to a Bloomberg news report, China has promised to take swift and decisive action to contain the spread of the chikungunya virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="138" data-end="270"&gt;Drones are being used to find places where mosquitoes are breeding. At the same time, scientists are releasing large “elephant mosquitoes” – about 2cm (0.8 inches) long – whose larvae eat the smaller mosquitoes that spread the virus. Health experts hope these mosquito helpers will play an important role in stopping the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="138" data-end="270"&gt;According to a report by the BBC, residents of affected areas in China have been ordered to eliminate standing water in and around their homes – including in flowerpots, coffee machines and empty bottles. Noncompliance may result in fines of up to 10,000 yuan (approximately $1,400), and in more serious cases, people could face criminal charges for “obstructing the prevention of infectious diseases”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="987" data-end="1255"&gt;Citing local sources, The New York Times said that in some instances, infected residents in Foshan are being moved to “quarantine wards”, where they are kept behind mosquito nets and screens. Some patients also say they were given no choice but to seek treatment at their own expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="987" data-end="1255"&gt;In other places, such as La Reunion and Mayotte, authorities have also launched enhanced surveillance, mosquito control initiatives and targeted vaccination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="987" data-end="1255"&gt;The Basque Country in Spain activated preventive protocols after a case was detected in Hendaye, just across the border in France. The protocols include increased surveillance in border towns and encouraging people to make reports through apps such as Mosquito Alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-chikungunya-be-prevented-and-treated"&gt;How can chikungunya be prevented and treated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities advise protecting oneself against mosquito bites as the most effective strategy against the spread of chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may involve wearing long sleeves and trousers, applying mosquito repellents, removing bodies of standing water where mosquitoes can breed, and staying in closed, air-conditioned spaces indoors or behind mosquito netting when outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are no specific medicines to treat the virus, rest, fluids and pain relievers may help alleviate symptoms, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="214" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""&gt;However, some pain relievers may be unsafe during a suspected infection. The CDC recommends avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) until dengue is ruled out, as they can raise the risk of bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_3874547" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3874547" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3874547" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2024-07-25T004356Z_362697650_RC2H09A5EM6M_RTRMADP_3_GUATEMALA-DENGUE-1754441362.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are examined at the entomology department of the Health Ministry, in Guatemala City, Guatemala, July 22, 2024.

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Mark Jurkowitz  | Outer Banks Voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of a WRAL report that a man has been hospitalized on the Outer Banks as the result of a Vibrio vulnificus infection, the Dare County Department of Health and Human Service (DCHHS) is reporting two known cases in the county and providing guidance on how to prevent potentially dangerous recreational water-related illnesses (RWIs).&lt;span id="more-340640"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-c184ecb16f807fdb29f1f18f87633242 outer-mobile-content-one" id="outer-c184ecb16f807fdb29f1f18f87633242"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first case reported to DCHSS was a Vibrio vulnificus infection that resulted from the individual swimming in the Croatan Sound with a cut on their forearm. That person was hospitalized from July 15-20 and then released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second case involves a patient who was hospitalized on July 28 and remains in the hospital with a Vibrio vulnificus infection. The infection occurred after that person waded into the Croatan Sound with an open would on the ankle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-2b2a66b20457769d15e375d9a3b63180 outer-mobile-content-top" id="outer-2b2a66b20457769d15e375d9a3b63180"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-8ae6e85b034530982705cee0128728aa outer-content-top" id="outer-8ae6e85b034530982705cee0128728aa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 5, the DCHSS also released this information on WRIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dare County Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services would like to remind the public of the importance of preventing recreational water-related illnesses (RWIs). RWIs are caused by germs or chemicals found in water bodies such as swimming pools, hot tubs, lakes, rivers, estuaries, and oceans. It is important to understand how to prevent these illnesses and enjoy water activities safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RWIs are infections that can be contracted by swallowing, breathing in, or having contact with contaminated water. The most common types of RWIs include gastrointestinal illnesses, skin infections, respiratory infections, and ear infections. These illnesses can be caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-7fea93195e178a29f476e72043cff949 outer-mobile-content-mid" id="outer-7fea93195e178a29f476e72043cff949"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing what we traditionally see with recreational water illnesses during the summer. Our department will stay vigilant in surveillance, but we are experiencing nothing out of the ordinary for this time of year in a coastal environment,” said Sheila Davies, Director of DCHHS. “It’s important to remember bacteria is naturally in the water, however, the risk of getting sick to the general public remains very low. Commercial fishermen, specifically crabbers, are at a higher risk due to the nature of their job. It is essential for all to follow water safety recommendations to help minimize the risk of developing water-related illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-6c2d91bb9f6f9ac3b649e101529f4971 outer-content-mid" id="outer-6c2d91bb9f6f9ac3b649e101529f4971"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DCHHS recommends the following safety tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t swim if you’re sick.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have diarrhea or any other contagious illness, avoid swimming or entering any recreational water facilities. This will help prevent the contamination of water and the spread of germs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t swim if you have a compromised immune system or open wounds.&lt;/strong&gt; People with weakened immune systems should consult their healthcare provider before participating in recreational water activities, such as swimming. Open wounds such as cuts, scrapes, and recent tattoos can leave you more susceptible to illness. If you have a wound, including from a recent surgery, piercing, or tattoo, stay out of salt or brackish water, if possible. This includes wading at the beach. Cover your wounds with a waterproof bandage if it could come into contact with salt water, brackish water, or raw or undercooked seafood and its juices. Promptly tend to any wounds, cuts or abrasions you get while in or near the water. Thoroughly wash the wound with clean, drinkable water and soap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shower before swimming.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a quick shower with soap and water before entering the water. This helps remove any germs or contaminants on your body, reducing the risk of spreading them into the water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t swallow the water.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid swallowing water while swimming or participating in water activities. Ingesting even a small amount of contaminated water can lead to illness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use proper hygiene practices.&lt;/strong&gt; Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after using the restroom or changing diapers. This is crucial in preventing the spread of germs to others and reducing the risk of contamination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change diapers in designated areas.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have young children who wear diapers, change them in designated diaper-changing areas and not near the water. Dispose of diapers properly to prevent contamination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep water clean.&lt;/strong&gt; If you own a pool or hot tub, maintain proper water chemistry and filtration systems. Regularly test the water and ensure it meets the recommended standards. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and maintaining your pool or hot tub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid swimming in high-risk areas or situations.&lt;/strong&gt; Heavy rainfalls can wash contaminants into recreational water bodies, increasing the risk of RWIs. Wait at least 24-48 hours after heavy rainfall before swimming to allow the water to clear. Avoid swimming near ocean outfalls at all times. Marine or ocean outfalls discharge wastewater, stormwater, and other potentially contaminated waters to the sea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay informed.&lt;/strong&gt; Check for any local advisories or warnings regarding water quality before swimming or participating in water activities. Stay updated on any closures or restrictions in your area. Further information regarding advisories may be obtained from North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) by visiting their &lt;a href="https://www.deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/marine-fisheries/shellfish-sanitation-and-recreational-water-quality/recreational-water-quality"&gt;NC Recreational Water Quality Swimming Advisory Map&lt;/a&gt; or signing up to receive NCDEQ press releases on their  &lt;a href="https://www.deq.nc.gov/news/press-release?field_agency_department_target_id=1091"&gt;Water Quality Swimming Advisories&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach children about water safety.&lt;/strong&gt; Educate children about the importance of not swallowing water, using proper hygiene practices, and following safety rules while swimming or playing in water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report any water quality concerns.&lt;/strong&gt; If you notice any issues with water quality or suspect an outbreak of RWIs, report it to the appropriate authorities, such as North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, your local health department and/or pool operators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek medical care if you become ill.&lt;/strong&gt; If you get cut while in the sound or ocean, seek a doctor’s care if you become ill, a rash or swelling develops around the wound, or it appears infected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Centenarians, once considered rare, have become commonplace. Indeed, they are the &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/living-to-one-hundred-life-expectancy/"&gt;fastest-growing demographic group&lt;/a&gt; of the world's population, with numbers roughly doubling every ten years since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long humans can live, and what determines a long and healthy life, have been of interest for as long as we know. Plato and Aristotle discussed and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12092789/"&gt;wrote about the ageing process&lt;/a&gt; over 2,300 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of understanding the secrets behind exceptional longevity isn't easy, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;Study Reveals Turning Point When Your Body's Aging Accelerates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It involves &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105197/"&gt;unravelling the complex interplay&lt;/a&gt; of genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors and how they interact throughout a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now our recent study, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-023-00936-w"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; has unveiled some common biomarkers, including levels of cholesterol and glucose, in people who live past 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonagenarians and centenarians have long been of intense interest to scientists as they may help us understand how to live longer, and perhaps also how to age in better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, studies of centenarians have often been small scale and focused on a selected group, for example, excluding centenarians who live in care homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_103536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103536" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-642x260.jpg" alt="Old Woman Holds Her Young Photo Up" class="wp-image-103536 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-103536" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Dimitri Otis/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Huge dataset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ours is the largest study comparing biomarker profiles measured throughout life among exceptionally long-lived people and their shorter-lived peers to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compared the biomarker profiles of people who went on to live past the age of 100, and their shorter-lived peers, and investigated the link between the profiles and the chance of becoming a centenarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research included data from 44,000 Swedes who underwent health assessments at ages 64-99 - they were a sample of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28158674/"&gt;the so-called Amoris cohort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_87621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-87621" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-642x260.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-87621 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-87621" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants were then followed through Swedish register data for up to 35 years. Of these people, 1,224, or 2.7%, lived to be 100 years old. The vast majority (85%) of the centenarians were female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve blood-based biomarkers related to inflammation, metabolism, liver and kidney function, as well as potential malnutrition and anaemia, were included. All of these &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0719-5"&gt;have been associated&lt;/a&gt; with ageing or mortality in previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biomarker related to inflammation was uric acid – a waste product in the body caused by the digestion of certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also looked at markers linked to metabolic status and function including total cholesterol and glucose, and ones related to liver function, such as alanine aminotransferase (Alat), aspartate aminotransferase (Asat), albumin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (Alp) and lactate dehydrogenase (LD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also looked at creatinine, which is linked to kidney function, and iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), which is linked to anaemia. Finally, we also investigated albumin, a biomarker associated with nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_135978" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-135978" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-642x260.jpg" alt="older couple at beach" class="size-medium wp-image-135978" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-135978" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Studies of centenarians have often been small scale. (Halfpoint Images/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that, on the whole, those who made it to their hundredth birthday tended to have lower levels of glucose, creatinine and uric acid from their sixties onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the median values didn't differ significantly between centenarians and non-centenarians for most biomarkers, centenarians seldom displayed extremely high or low values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, very few of the centenarians had a glucose level above 6.5 mmol/L earlier in life, or a creatinine level above 125 µmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of the biomarkers, both centenarians and non-centenarians had values outside of the range considered normal in clinical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably because these guidelines are set based on a younger and healthier population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When exploring which biomarkers were linked to the likelihood of reaching 100, we found that all but two (alat and albumin) of the 12 biomarkers showed a connection to the likelihood of turning 100. This was even after accounting for age, sex and disease burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people in the lowest out of five groups for levels of total cholesterol and iron had a lower chance of reaching 100 years as compared to those with higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people with higher levels of glucose, creatinine, uric acid and markers for liver function also decreased the chance of becoming a centenarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In absolute terms, the differences were rather small for some of the biomarkers, while for others the differences were somewhat more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For uric acid, for instance, the absolute difference was 2.5 percentage points. This means that people in the group with the lowest uric acid had a 4% chance of turning 100 while in the group with the highest uric acid levels only 1.5% made it to age 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the differences we discovered were overall rather small, they suggest a potential link between metabolic health, nutrition and exceptional longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, however, does not allow any conclusions about which lifestyle factors or genes are responsible for the biomarker values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is reasonable to think that factors such as nutrition and alcohol intake play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of your kidney and liver values, as well as glucose and uric acid as you get older, is probably not a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, chance probably plays a role at some point in reaching an exceptional age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fact that differences in biomarkers could be observed a long time before death suggests that genes and lifestyle may also play a role.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/215166/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;In a small randomized controlled trial, people lost twice as much weight when their diet was limited to minimally processed food compared to when they switched to a diet that included ultraprocessed versions of foods but was otherwise nutritionally matched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03842-0"&gt;published in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at University College London, adds to a growing body of evidence that food processing, in addition to simple nutrition content, influences our weight and health. Ultraprocessed foods have already been vilified for their link to obesity—largely through weaker observational studies—but researchers have struggled to shore up the connection with high-quality studies and understand their impact on health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultraprocessed foods researchers provided in the new trial were relatively healthy ones—as ultraprocessed foods go. They included things like multigrain breakfast cereal, packaged granola bars, flavored yogurt cups, fruit snacks, commercially premade chicken sandwiches, instant noodles, and ready-made lasagna. But, in the minimally processed trial diet, participants received meals from a caterer rather than ones from a grocery store aisle. The diet included overnight oats with fresh fruit, plain yogurt with toasted oats and fruit, handmade fruit and nut bars, freshly made chicken salad, and from-scratch stir fry and spaghetti bolognese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the level of processing differed between the diets, the large-scale nutrition content—fat, protein, carbohydrates, fiber—were similar, as was the proportions of fruits, vegetables, dairy, and starchy food. Overall, both diets adhered to the dietary guidance from the UK government, called the Eatwell Guide (EWG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diet processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial had a crossover design, meaning that participants were randomly split to start out on either the ultraprocessed food (UPF) diet or the minimally processed food (MPF) diet. They stayed on their starter diet for eight weeks, then took a break, and switched to the other diet. For both diets, food was delivered directly to the participants' homes. Participants ate what they wanted and, mostly, didn't seem to cheat by sneaking other food, based on food diaries and reported adherence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty participants completed at least one diet, while 43 completed both diets. The participants were mostly women, with a mean age of 43, and all had a body mass index categorized as overweight or obesity. At the start of the trial, ultraprocessed foods made up, on average, nearly 70 percent of the participants' standard diets, and they were not adhering to the EWG recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

            Cruel words can leave a mark on a child –– and may have as much of an impact as physical abuse, new research has found﻿.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot00083b6nyablv7mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who experienced physical abuse as a child were at a 50% increased risk of reporting low mental health in adulthood compared with those with no abuse, according to the study published Tuesday in the &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-098412" target="_blank"&gt;journal BMJ Open&lt;/a&gt;. Those who experienced verbal abuse had a 60% increase in likelihood of low well-being.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot00093b6n7385a5h1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The prevalence of physical abuse&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in people in England and Wales has halved, from 20% in people born from 1950 to 1979 to 10% in those born in or after 2000, according to the study. Verbal abuse, on the other hand, has increased.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The survey listed emotional instead of verbal abuse, but asked about similar behaviors as the most recent study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000b3b6nr4zjpf2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In this latest analysis, researchers analyzed data from more than 20,000 adults across seven different studies in England and Wales. The study team evaluated childhood experiences using the Adverse Childhood Experiences tool and components of adult mental health using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000c3b6n4zzakwzy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The “results suggest that verbal abuse in childhood can leave mental health scars as deep and long-lasting as those caused by physical abuse,” said lead study author Dr. Mark Bellis, professor of public health and behavioral sciences at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Across the United States and the world, there has been an epidemiological shift of a greater burden of verbal abuse across generations, said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Shanta Dube, professor of epidemiology and director of the department of public health at the Levine College of Health Sciences at Wingate University in Wingate, North Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000e3b6nod98uj3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She added that emotional abuse is “often tied to the act of verbal abuse and therefore verbal abuse can often get lost.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000f3b6nig2a0j93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rise of verbal abuse amid the decline of physical abuse highlights a need to raise awareness around spoken abuse, especially given the lasting impact, said Dube, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000g3b6nll4nc03a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Verbal abuse may be eroding the mental health benefits we should expect from successful efforts to reduce physical abuse,” Bellis added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000h3b6nmngy67ct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It can be hard to draw the line for sure on what language is harsh and what is verbal abuse, but it can include blaming, insulting, scolding, criticizing or threatening children, said Dr. Andrea Danese, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at King’s College London and adjunct clinical professor at the Yale Child Study Center. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000i3b6njh4cg0pa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Think about the use of derogatory terms or statements intended to frighten, humiliate, denigrate or belittle a person,” he said. “It is often unintentional.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000j3b6nh349k3ft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Comments can sound like “Johnny can do it. Why can’t you?” “You always make mistakes,” “You’re stupid,” or “You’re worthless,” Dube said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000k3b6nwqs1bsfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Harsh, denigrating words spoken to children have lasting impacts. Children developmentally are concrete thinkers ‘it is or isn’t,” she said in an email. “They can take things literally.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000l3b6n8vm5bwea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children rely on the language of the adults in their immediate environment to learn both about themselves and the world, Danese said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000m3b6nh0eeftp8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Therefore, the way children are talked to can be very powerful in both positive and negative ways, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000n3b6n1jn2yzt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Being the subject of verbal abuse can twist a young person’s understanding of who they are and their role in the world,” Danese said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000o3b6npb26ah6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study relies on observational data, meaning that researchers cannot say for sure that verbal abuse in childhood causes poorer mental health in adulthood, only that there is a connection between the two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000p3b6norwmu3w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It could be that people who experience verbal abuse in their younger years have trauma later, but it also could be that adults with worse mental health are more likely to remember their childhood more harshly, Danese said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000q3b6nvq8qrlub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the sample size was large enough and the approach was strong enough to add to the existing evidence around impacts of verbal abuse, Dube said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmdz02j8r00123b6n993k1x75@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="language-has-power-good-and-bad" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Language has power –– good and bad
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000r3b6nzkhs9nf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is increasingly important that researchers and individuals pay attention to the factors that impact long-term mental health, Bellis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000s3b6n4wuoui0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Poor mental health is a major and growing global public health issue, particularly among adolescents and young adults,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000t3b6n27u4utb9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Part of the decline in physical abuse may be attributed to more awareness, data collection and campaigns focused on its reduction over the years, Dube added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000u3b6nwbb9uuvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Improving childhood environments can directly enhance mental well-being as well as helping build resilience to protect against the future mental health challenges individuals may face through adolescence and adulthood,” Bellis said in an email. “We need to ensure that the harms of verbal abuse are more widely recognised.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000v3b6njezwj8dx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents and caregivers with more information and support may be better equipped to create better home environments for their children, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000w3b6nfnv599ib@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This means helping build emotional regulation skills in parents and children, helping catalyse emotional attachment between them, developing their communication skills and encouraging modelling behaviours in parents so that they demonstrate the type of approaches to problems that they would like to see in their children,” Bellis said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000x3b6n1mpjxpxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the issue doesn’t stop with parents –– all adults who interact with children need to understand the impacts of verbal abuse, Dube said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000y3b6nvbbyw7xr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And the answer isn’t just to shame adults, Danese said. Instead, he and other researchers are looking to support a cultural shift toward everyone being more mindful about the language used toward children and how it might affect them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000z3b6nyvc5emti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not about dramatising times when we could have let negative comments on children slip,” he said in an email. “It is about being mindful of them and trying to repair them with an apology, a correction, and an explanation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Fifty-eight people in New York City have been diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease, a serious bacterial lung infection, and two people have died, according to the city health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100043b6o1gneou0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The bacteria, Legionella, is &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/legionnaires-disease-faq-central-harlem.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;suspected to be spread&lt;/a&gt; by cooling towers on buildings in Central Harlem. A cooling tower is a rooftop device that releases mist into the air as it cools a large building. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn’t properly disinfected, Legionella can grow and sicken people who inhale the mist. The disease cannot be spread from person to person.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100053b6orv2df64x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The city health department first announced the cluster on July 25. The city said it would test all the cooling towers in the area, and as of Monday, remediation was completed on 11 that had an initial positive screening for the Legionella pneumophila bacteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Anyone in these zip codes with flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible,” Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said in a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/nyc-health-provides-second-legionnaires-cluster-update.page" target="_blank"&gt;news release on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100073b6om2k8muq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscles aches and shortness of breath. It’s treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can cause shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. About 10% of people who get Legionnaires’ &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;die from complications&lt;/a&gt; of their illness, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it’s more dangerous for older adults and people with weakened immune systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100083b6ovzn2bgy6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Around 6,000 Legionnaires’ disease cases are reported each year in the United States, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but reported totals may be lower than the actual cases in part because it can be difficult to distinguish Legionnaires’ disease from other types of pneumonia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

While most symptoms usually resolve within two weeks, the “debilitating” joint pain can persist for months or years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." aria-label="World Health Organization."&gt;World Health Organization.&lt;/a&gt; The joint pain is the calling card of chikungunya and, without it, people with the virus can easily be misdiagnosed as having dengue or Zika, making it hard to know exactly how many people are infected. Chikungunya was first detected in southern Tanzania in the 1950s. The name comes from a word in the Kimakonde language of southern Tanzania that means “that which bends up," meant to describe the contorted posture of people with severe joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Does Chikungunya Virus Spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya can only be transmitted to a person through the bite of an infected mosquito, but people can transmit it right back to the insect. So if a non-infected mosquito bites a person with the chikungunya, it can contract the virus and infect the next healthy person it bites. It is not contagious or transmittable person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Chikungunya Vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. There are two approved for use in the United States: IXCHIQ, a live-attenuated vaccine, is approved for people 18 and older and VIMKUNYA, a virus-like particle vaccine, is approved for those 12 and older. The CDC only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" aria-label="recommends"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine to people traveling to an area with a chikungunya outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There Chikungunya Virus In The United States?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but it's not common. In the U.S., chikungunya is primarily found in travelers who've been infected in other countries and a locally acquired case hasn't been reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" aria-label="since 2019"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But travel-associated cases are on the rise. Chikungunya was rarely found in the U.S. before 2006, but as many as 28 people per year tested positive from 2006 to 2013. Nearly 3,000 travel-associated cases were identified in 2014 but that number steadily decreased down to 36 in 2021 before slowly climbing again. There were 199 cases found in 2024 and, in 2025, there have been 46 cases so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where Chikungunya Virus Most Commonly Found?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" aria-label="warn"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; that U.S. travelers visiting Brazil, Columbia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines are at an elevated risk of exposure. The CDC also issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" aria-label="Level 2"&gt;Level 2&lt;/a&gt; travel alert for Foshan city, and recommends any traveler to the area be vaccinated. People who do visit are encouraged to prevent mosquito bites by wearing insect repellent, long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Pregnant women are advised not to travel to the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What To Watch For&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More infections.

						&lt;p&gt;A North Carolina man is still &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-outer-banks-man-icu-nc-cases-august-2025/"&gt;fighting a serious bacterial
infection&lt;/a&gt; that landed him in an Outer Banks ICU for more than a week. His case is one
of a handful reported this year, drawing attention to a potentially deadly bacteria
found in coastal waters.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; is a flesh-eating bacterium that
can cause serious illness and lead to sepsis, shock, and large blisters that
destroy tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The bacteria live in brackish water – a mixture of fresh and
salt water. North Carolina is home to several areas where &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt;
could flourish near the coast, especially during warmer months. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;An infection usually occurs in two ways: if someone has an
open wound and enters brackish water, or if someone eats contaminated raw
shellfish, usually oysters.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Infections are rare but can be fatal. About 1 in 5 people with
&lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; will die, sometimes in as little as 1-2 days, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_population-people-at-risk"&gt;according
to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina has already reported one confirmed death from
&lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS data shows 59 total cases of Vibrio were reported
between January 1-July 31, 2025. Of them, 7 are confirmed &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt;
infections. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-nc-coast-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-nc-coast-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Those at the highest risk of infection are those who:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Have cuts, scrapes or surgical wounds and go
into brackish water&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Have weakened immune systems &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Eat raw oysters or undercooked seafood&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;While longer, warmer seasons are allowing more bacteria to
grow, the average beachgoer’s risk remains low. For reference, roughly &lt;a href="https://www.outerbankschamber.com/main/north-carolina-s-outer-banks/"&gt;5
million people visit the Outer Banks&lt;/a&gt; every year, according to the Outer
Banks Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-nc-coast-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS State Veterinarian Carl Williams said he wants people
to know it’s still safe to go enjoy the beach, but it’s important to manage
risk of Vibrio infections. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Don’t be afraid to go,” Williams said. “Just know, like
anything, that every activity is probably going to have a certain amount of
risk associated with it. If you have a wound, cover it before you go into salt
water. If you sustain a wound while you’re in the water, come out and wash it.”
&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state health expert explained &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; that
causes necrotizing fasciitis, as well as &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Parahaemolyticus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Alginolyticus&lt;/i&gt; that cause the food-borne illnesses, are all normal
inhabitants of a marine environment, like those found on North Carolina’s coast.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He added, “Our message to people is yes, they’re in the ocean
and the sounds, but they’re supposed to be there. You can take precautions to
make sure you don’t get infected.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;People heading to the beach can take &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/prevention/index.html"&gt;these simple measures&lt;/a&gt;
to significantly reduce risk of vibrio infections:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Avoid eating raw or undercooked seafood&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Shower with soap after leaving the beach &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Cleaning cuts and wounds with hydrogen peroxide &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Cover wounds with waterproof bandages when
entering brackish water&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of a &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; infection can occur
within 1 to 2 days. Health officials said early warning signs need to be taken
seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-nc-coast-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;If you experience any of these symptoms, seek medical
attention immediately:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Redness or swelling near a wound&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Skin blisters or pain&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Fever&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·

In April, her doctor prescribed her the weight loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ali Eastburn, here a size 16, said she struggled with weight gain after menopause,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/health/is-wegovy-safe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and others in its class (the active agent, semaglutide, is marketed under the brand names &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/doctor-explains-why-tiktokers-should-avoid-viral-weight-loss-trend-with-diabetes-drug-ozempic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Wegovy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/tirzepatide-new-drug-weight-loss-expected-approval-fda-this-year/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mounjaro;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;) impact satiety.

Semaglutide has demonstrated improvements in CV death, stroke and myocardial infarction. Novo Nordisk remains confident in the benefit-risk profile of our GLP-1 medicines, when used consistent with their indications and product labeling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eastburn said, "At first, it seemed like a miracle. The weight was just coming off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By the start of July, Eastburn had lost 15 lbs. “I felt better and that there was hope,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But then, her weight loss stalled: “I knew I had to do something drastic as I was desperate to look better. I didn't want to hate the wedding photos for the rest of my life,” Eastburn said. “I upped my dose so I could get to my goal of losing 20 lbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eastburn did not clarify whether she consulted with a doctor before increasing her dosage of Ozempic.

She said she ended up in the emergency room twice, struggling with nausea and “violent diarrhea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, she flew from Nashville to Orange County, Calif., on July 15 for the wedding — only to get so ill on the flight that once they landed, “an ambulance took me to the hospital straight away and I was diagnosed with a burst appendix.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A burst appendix is a medical emergency, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8095-appendicitis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and happens when the appendix becomes inflamed; When it bursts, it sends bacteria throughout your body, risking life-threatening complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eastburn spent four days in the hospital, missing Chase’s rehearsal dinner. ”I just cried as I felt like it was my fault as I did this to myself. I missed all of this as I wanted to be thin and it broke my heart,” said Eastburn, who nearly missed the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We went at the very last minute as I was in so much pain. Sitting on a chair was so painful and I could barely walk. When my son saw me sitting in the front row, he came over and hugged me for the longest time and bawled like a baby,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We didn't think I was going to be at the wedding, much less live to tell anyone about it. I didn't care about my size as I was just so proud to be there.

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found what they dubbed a “sex-related gap” in the use of DMTs between women and men with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) with disease onset between the ages of 18 and 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, the team called for both clinicians and patients to be “educated on the most recent recommendations on the use of DMTs,” specifically “in the context of pregnancy,” to prevent this inequity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra Vukusic, MD, PhD, a study author from the University of Lyon, noted that “when used early, MS drugs can delay the burden of the disease.” Thus, “women who are not treated could have worse outcomes in the long term and an increased risk of long-term disability,” Vukusic said in an &lt;a href="https://aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5274"&gt;American Academy of Neurology press release&lt;/a&gt; outlining the study’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This loss of chance is not acceptable anymore, as there are drugs that are compatible with pregnancy or can continue to fight the disease long after people stop them when they are trying to conceive,”  Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213907"&gt;Sex-Related Gap in the Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS occurs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; when the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath that serves as a protective coating around nerve fibers, ensuring the efficient transmission of electric signals in the body. The disease is most commonly diagnosed in young adults and women. In fact, being a woman is one of the strongest risk factors for developing the disease, data have shown.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-treatment/"&gt;Treatment approaches for MS&lt;/a&gt; have markedly evolved in recent years, most notably with the introduction of various DMTs. Evidence shows that access to high-efficacy DMTs early on in the disease is more effective at preventing long-term disability progression than not using such treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Women 20% less likely than men to receive highly effective DMTs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a research team from institutions across France sought to assess if and how a person’s sex affects access to DMTs. To that end, the team retrospectively analyzed health records from people with RRMS that had started between patients were ages 18 to 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis included data from 16,857 women and 5,800 men, with a mean age of 29, who were followed for a median of 11.6 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings indicated that women with RRMS were less likely to receive a DMT than men with the disease. Data specifically showed that the percentage of person-years that study patients received a DMT was lower for women than it was for men (60.2% vs. 61.3%). The same was true for highly effective DMTs (23.5% vs. 25.3%). Person-years is a unit that measures the amount of time a group of people has been observed; it is calculated by taking the number of people being studied and multiplying it by the number of years they were followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because women tend to have more active disease, and also are often advised to halt treatment during pregnancy or postpartum, the researchers reanalyzed the data after making adjustments for these factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differences were found to persist, with women having an 8% lower chance of receiving a DMT compared with men. In the case of highly effective DMTs, analysis showed that women were 20% less likely than men to receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found that women were less likely to be treated with a disease-modifying drug than men with the same level of disease severity, even when we took into account people who stopped taking their drugs during pregnancy or postpartum,” Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sex-related differences became evident two years after disease onset for DMTs and one year for highly effective DMTs, and did not differ significantly according to patients’ age, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Study found certain treatments significantly underused by women&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain treatments were significantly underused in women, the researchers found. Among them were teriflunomide (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/aubagio-teriflunomide-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Aubagio&lt;/a&gt;), as well as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulators — a class of DMTs that include fingolimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/gilenya-fingolimod-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Gilenya&lt;/a&gt;), siponimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/mayzent-siponimod"&gt;Mayzent&lt;/a&gt;), ponesimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ponvory-ponesimod-relapsing-rrms/"&gt;Ponvory&lt;/a&gt;), and ozanimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/zeposia-ozanimod/"&gt;Zeposia&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also significantly underused by women were CD20 inhibitors, such as ocrelizumab (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ocrevus-ocrelizumab-primary-progressive-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Ocrevus&lt;/a&gt;), the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferon-based medications and natalizumab (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/tysabri-natalizumab-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Tysabri&lt;/a&gt;) were initially less used by women, but then became equally used by both female and male patients after some time. Interestingly, glatiramer acetate (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/copaxone-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Copaxone&lt;/a&gt;) and fumarate therapies, such as dimethyl fumarate (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/tecfidera-dimethyl-fumarate-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Tecfidera&lt;/a&gt;), were initially equally used by patients of both sexes, but then became more frequently used by women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Anticipation of pregnancy was probably an important factor in this difference between women and men with MS, but there could also be a reluctance to use these treatments when they may actually be the best way to manage the disease and delay disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses also showed that among the 5,268 women who had a child, the proportion of those given DMTs started to decline 18 months before childbirth, from 42.6% to 27.9% at the estimated time of conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anticipation of pregnancy was probably an important factor in this difference between women and men with MS, but there could also be a reluctance to use these treatments when they may actually be the best way to manage the disease and delay disability,” Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors also may have played a role, according to Vukusic, such a lag in both clinicians and patients learning about the established safety of new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Another factor could be that new data continues to be collected on the safety of newer MS drugs, so more work is needed to communicate those findings to people with MS and their doctors,” Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these findings show a gap, by sex, in the use of DMTs by patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, these results highlight the need to educate both neurologists and patients on the latest guidelines for DMT use, particularly among women in their childbearing years, “to avoid deleterious therapeutic inertia.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A cancer diagnosis increases privately insured patients' monthly out-of-pocket costs, which also rise as the disease progresses, new research shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out-of-pocket costs jumped by $592.53 per month for the six months after a diagnosis, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/rose_2025_oi_250641_1752092469.71531.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAzAwggMsBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggMdMIIDGQIBADCCAxIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM1aXPC57hN3Y8iEDKAgEQgIIC46mfGInZf6KooHrPaV3UF7iZFwVr4lDTGA_P9TD3ZIiuR5oBEAJHnL9-Nvz6t2_ABtCy7Y9IbhpIW3Fy5RQJDF_dHlaNkIMLbZR1HEUelNUl8SHcBuYEu-dBYni3tV_EOGQOo0NChe-xH0OE530LJKm2fyDXGoOikA1SowsABUV4GruB2bHbaZrQdTe1Ram004ZK2lSZiYHUKLpMhWNzF1Djn1OjqGbOuQuvQeRiwUpqQl9rcsww5aIgId87PaJq4eBVZNC833KsQ8YxpM5HOMRWZy9kgIgBXplN8uE7497X-RbqQCFU8YTrCxcfLeRejnCudpC5uSTOHsiAgkoCt2wJZ7RAavIqpGWM6kHC24G2B8QT1-SS1DGsjCehR0hyCpGJt6cw1a9i0W6MN6YV_-V5VRfxJvADYYWw_JnvLAS6F6o9BWPkEUbQBjZz6b0vBpxIOh2JU04VmuZwPwikvn3_BVVDV5fGV9ZIqzL6TxcNgBmS0GdEVPuOVDsBEhLJxSutplc580W1udNIt9d5x4yxsoBIO29Xx4W8s-IwcJ2Qa6ngmQ3_c8IRBJtNfWN5XFeIBFbmDbg5VZpokqoWIpS742xqXu5Ve8FMC_F3OAvSdWk7ICua7wtxuTv_xmDPKMp3rG536gduBQj-D5813OH6z2LddAP0uBnEEfYlvsBZi2yKNX5Vj800xclAY0OVsde9V2dmjsVjOPGY49UHHsUwBklygi7eez_fPTj3W2H5COWHFtLyxNFqNTxiIRdJ9urvnMcwaNZmXdmEFJws-zuxfYPW7H_ceZByLvHRCs8qJ_7FL3KGFlxuGEpaeZx6tGogTujFj7eAHrVQrWbHWG6JT3gZIsuzSx-N37QL-5Sv87IWrc-t__N3anSkUfmgHzqe7cvb1K_Mp7DUISanr9uy-kjUx6f5bTsRLHgj6vy41dHZhkRbdQ_jJ735Rn-a2BXhyEFoZX9N-4nyF0EXV-_dBww" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Open Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study underscores the financial toll a cancer diagnosis can take on individuals, even for those who are insured but don't yet qualify for Medicare. While cancer tends to strike later in life, when most patients in treatment are receiving Medicare benefits, a cancer diagnosis can pose an undue financial burden on younger people with private insurance, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those out-of-pocket costs highlight the need for policy reform, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research "underscores the need for policies such as paid sick leave that address both insurance continuity and financial assistance, especially for patients with more advanced cancer," the report states. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out-of-pocket costs increased based on a patient's cancer progression, the analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with stage 0 cancer saw their costs rise by $462 per month compared to non-cancer patients, while stage 4 cancer cost people with private insurance an additional $719.97 per month in out of pocket costs. Costs rise as the disease progresses because patients typically require more treatment during cancer's later stages, leading to greater medical expenditures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This result seems straightforward; later-stage disease is associated with more intensive workup and treatment that can drive higher medical expenditures," the report states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed medical claims records from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry to compare the out-of-pocket costs of privately insured individuals under the age of 65 who were diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and lung cancer, to those without cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

                FALLS CHURCH, Va.   –  
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;
            Are you a TRICARE beneficiary taking a drug for weight loss—such as a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/FAQs/Pharmacy/PharmProg_Wegovy"&gt;GLP-1 medication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; like Zepbound or Wegovy? Do you have questions about what’s covered—and why?

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between TRICARE plans and coverage is key to knowing what to expect when filling your &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/pharmacy"&gt;prescription&lt;/a&gt;. There are different rules about how TRICARE covers these drugs based on your plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People are taking GLP-1 drugs—like Wegovy and Zepbound—for weight loss now more than ever,” said Defense Health Agency Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Paul Cordts. “It’s important to understand how—and why—TRICARE covers these drugs, based on your condition and status.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important: &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dha.mil/" target="_blank"&gt;Defense Health Agency&lt;/a&gt; is implementing regulatory controls on weight loss medication coverage. These controls take effect &lt;strong&gt;Aug. 31, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, these medications are still covered in certain circumstances. Otherwise, if you have an approved &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/pharmacy/priorauth"&gt;prior authorization&lt;/a&gt; for weight loss drugs, it’s no longer valid. You’ll need to see your provider to discuss your options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your weight loss drug isn’t covered, you should speak with your provider about other options. These may include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your provider can work with you to explore all options and determine the best approach for your health needs. Talk to your provider. You can also visit &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/HealthWellness"&gt;Health and Wellness&lt;/a&gt; for more details on resources that can help you reach your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re affected, you’ll get a notice in the mail in the coming weeks. Read below to learn more about which groups are affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRICARE coverage of weight loss medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;
TRICARE only covers weight loss medications for certain beneficiary groups. Coverage depends on your condition and certain criteria.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;TRICARE covers weight loss medications, including Saxenda, Wegovy, Zepbound, Qsymia, Phentermine or Contrave, for weight loss if:
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re enrolled in &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/prime"&gt;TRICARE Prime&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/Plans/HealthPlans/TS"&gt;TRICARE Select&lt;/a&gt;, or get these benefits from a premium-based plan. Premium-based plans include:

  
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You meet TRICARE’s clinical criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have a prescription from a TRICARE network provider.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your provider submits a &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/CoveredServices/Pharmacy/FillPrescriptions/PreAuthMedical"&gt;prior authorization&lt;/a&gt; form.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;TRICARE covers Trulicity, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Victoza to treat &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tricare.mil/News/TRICARE-News/Article/3311965/have-diabetes-check-supplies-services-tricare-covers"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Coverage requires:

						A Massachusetts mother has identified her newborn daughter as the possible case of Powassan virus that is under investigation by health officials on Martha's Vineyard. Health officials did not disclose where on the island the patient lives, their age or when they were infected. The virus has not been confirmed. Tiffany Sisco said her daughter, Lilly, had seizures and is receiving intensive care, including antibiotics, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  The family is awaiting the final testing results.Tiffany Sisco and her husband, Marcus, said shortly after the baby was born, they took her for a walk along a bike path in West Tisbury, with Lilly in a stroller covered by a blanket. Upon returning home, Tiffany discovered a tiny, pencil-head-sized tick on Lilly's ankle."I picked it off and I called him in and said, 'What do we do?' Because he's more familiar with them being a landscaper. And he said, 'Just throw it away. And we'll monitor her and make sure she doesn't get a rash, a bull's eye, anything like that. Like a week later she started getting a fever of 102. I said, 'I'm taking her right in,'" Tiffany Sisco said.For the first few days, Lilly needed help breathing, and her parents were unable to hold her. Doctors were uncertain if she would survive. The family now hopes to leave the hospital within a week. Tests indicate some signs of brain damage, but doctors are unsure how it may impact Lilly's development.Aside from the pending investigation, there has only been one case of Powassan virus on the island in the past 20 years. Three cases elsewhere in the state have been confirmed this year, officials said.Powassan is a rare but potentially serious virus transmitted by the bite of infected Ixodes scapularis ticks — commonly known as deer ticks. Unlike other tick-borne pathogens, Powassan virus can be transmitted within 15 minutes of a tick bite. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 2004 to 2024, there were 397 Powassan cases nationally with 50 deaths, with almost half of those infections occurring in the last five years.Massachusetts ranks second behind Minnesota in total number of cases in that same time frame, with 71, according to the CDC.So far in 2025, there have been 24 cases in seven states, with three of those recorded in Massachusetts, according to the CDC.There is no specific treatment, vaccine or cure for Powassan virus disease. Severe cases can cause brain swelling, encephalitis, confusion, seizures and long-term neurological complications."The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare," said Dr. Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor with longstanding research on Martha’s Vineyard. Telford’s lab has tested more than 3,500 nymph deer ticks between 2021 and 2024. "Between 1 and 2% of nymph deer ticks on Martha’s Vineyard are infected. This is a similar rate to that seen elsewhere in New England. This suggests that many people who are exposed may successfully fight off the virus without ever knowing they were infected," Telford said.Top tips to prevent tick bites:    Treat your clothing and gear with permethrin.    Dress “tick-smart” — tuck pants into socks, shirts into pants, wear light-colored clothes to spot ticks more easily.        Leggings and snug-fitting clothing can prevent ticks from reaching the skin. Use a lint roller on your clothing after coming in from the outdoors to remove "hitchhikers."        Change clothes or shower soon after being outside.        Put clothes in the dryer on high for 20 minutes to kill ticks.

"People are buying and installing these systems in homes and schools hoping to protect themselves and their families but the science hasn't caught up to the marketing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only 8% included human participants &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the 672 studies on a total of 1,073 interventions, 90% evaluated environmental samples only, only 8% included human participants, and 1% were based on sentinel animals. No studies reported pregnant women, fetus health, or postpartum populations. A total of 60% of studies analyzed at least one intervention classified as pathogen inactivation, with 30% involving pathogen removal or air exchange or dilution, and 21% on air exchange or dilution. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In total, 51 were observational studies, and six were randomized controlled trials. Studies were from all six World Health Organization regions, including the Americas (41%), Europe (25%), and the Western Pacific (25%). Three studies were from Africa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most environmental studies were conducted in scaled or full-sized chambers. Other common settings were real-world or simulated healthcare facilities, schools, other workplaces, transportation conveyances, and residential buildings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of all studies, 49% measured viable harmless microbes from air samples, followed by nonbiological particulate matter (eg, tracer gases, dust; 29%), and disease-causing viruses or bacteria (22%). Potential lung irritants (eg, ozone) that can be produced by ionizers, plasma-based technologies, and some UV systems were measured only rarely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No studies measured quality of life or functioning, sustainability (eg, carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions), or economic analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Funding statements were unclear or unreported in 23% of studies. Of those with funding statements, 30% had multiple funding types. Most (66%) reported government funding. Conflict of interest (COI) statements were absent or unclear in 45%. In 291 studies, no authors included a COI statement. In the remaining 77 studies, 40% reported at least one COI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research on real-world health outcomes needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We were surprised to find that most of the research tested air cleaning devices in lab chambers, not in real-world settings where people live, work or go to school," Lisa Bero, PhD, of UC, said in the release. "We need stronger studies that look at actual health outcomes, whether people are actually exposed to fewer pathogens or get sick less often, and not just measurements of particles in the air."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coauthor Louis Leslie, of UC, said, "Ozone and other chemicals created by some air-cleaning devices can actually harm the respiratory system, especially in children or people with chronic respiratory illnesses."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be able to fully fund the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/php/od2a/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Overdose Data to Action or OD2A program&lt;/a&gt; ahead of a key budget deadline, according to a CDC senior leader. A second CDC staff member confirmed that "there have been developments and we are likely to have full funding," although they did not have details on when the funding would become available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity because they fear retribution for speaking to the press without authorization. Some staffers at CDC expressed to NPR that this appeared to be good news, although the funding situation was still fluid and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR reported last month that the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/16/nx-s1-5468535/fentanyl-trump-addiction-funding" target="_blank"&gt;was withholding $140 million&lt;/a&gt; from the OD2A program, which state and local public health departments rely on to lower overdose deaths from fentanyl, methamphetamines and other drugs across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Previously frozen funding for other CDC programs, including &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/nx-s1-5349529/hhs-layoffs-sexual-assault-rape-prevention" target="_blank"&gt;rape and domestic violence prevention&lt;/a&gt;, is also getting released, the senior CDC leader said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Funding, 30 days at a time&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The delays were part of a broader issue with funding at CDC. As NPR &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;reported in June&lt;/a&gt;, for months, CDC waited for the $9 billion Congress intended for the agency for fiscal year 2025. In the meantime, it received small amounts of money every 30 days to cover payroll and other limited expenses.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The senior leader described the process like receiving money "with an eyedropper."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without a pot of money to distribute out to various centers and divisions, the CDC couldn't send out the notice of awards that state and local health departments need to be able to do their work and know they will be reimbursed for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Most state health departments get most of their funding from the feds — in Alabama's case, we get more than two thirds of our funding from federal grants, predominantly CDC," Dr. Scott Harris, who runs Alabama's health department, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;told NPR in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Deadlines missed &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health departments across the country sounded the alarm as deadlines approached or passed for CDC funding of HIV prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-cuts-threaten-cancer-screening-state-level-tracking-for-emerging-threats/" target="_blank"&gt;cancer registries&lt;/a&gt; and overdose prevention programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, most of those programs across CDC apparently can continue, including OD2A. Grantees for the OD2A program, who had been told in July they would be receiving only half of their funding, will soon be told they will receive the full amount, according to the senior leader at CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news comes after advocates had been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/16/nx-s1-5468535/fentanyl-trump-addiction-funding" target="_blank"&gt;warning for weeks&lt;/a&gt; of the harms that delayed or partial funding to the program could have. If full funding is actually coming, "it'll be welcome, but it's not without the toll that it's already taken," says &lt;a href="https://www.safestates.org/page/SharonGilmartin" target="_blank"&gt;Sharon Gilmartin&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Safe States Alliance, a public health advocacy group. For instance, NPR reported on a local health department in North Carolina that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;laid off staff&lt;/a&gt; because of CDC funding delays, only to have the funding come through weeks late without explanation. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think anybody will feel confident until they have money in hand," Gilmartin adds. "And I'll be honest, I think the concern is that — if this is what we went through this year, even if funding comes through, are we going to be doing this again next year?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was no available explanation from the Trump administration or the Office for Management and Budget for the delays or the release of the funding. OMB and the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC senior leader describes the release of funding for the agency as a relief. "It's great we have our apportionment," they tell NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Some funds frozen&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there's a new funding challenge. Several dozen specific CDC programs have now had their budget lines frozen at the direction of OMB, according to the senior leader at CDC. The news of the frozen funds was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-cdc-funding-freeze-79e7090f" target="_blank"&gt;by the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The frozen programs are mostly in the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, according to the senior leader at CDC. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A list of frozen programs reviewed by NPR includes those that address tobacco use, nutrition, physical activity and obesity, school health, inflammatory bowel disease, excessive alcohol use, chronic disease education and awareness, national diabetes prevention program, oral health, epilepsy, and more.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"What does it all mean?"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Funding for five programs at the CDC's Injury Center was frozen by OMB as well, including youth violence prevention, adverse childhood experiences, firearm injury, injury control research centers, and injury prevention activities. Gilmartin of the Safe States Alliance says it's hard to understand why these programs were targeted. "I can't come up with an ideological reason why you would want to cut funding that supports positive early childhood," for instance, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The senior leader at CDC says there are some big questions for OMB and the Trump administration: "How do we interpret all of this? What does it all mean?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There were whole teams fired during the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/05/g-s1-58312/hhs-layoffs-rif-cdc-fda-nih" target="_blank"&gt;dramatic reduction in force&lt;/a&gt; across HHS in April that appear to have full funding, the senior leader says, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sexual-violence/programs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rape Prevention and Education&lt;/a&gt; Program. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are programs with their budget lines frozen by OMB that are fully staffed, and still other priorities set forth in President Trump's 2026 budget, they say, which leaves the impression that there's no overarching strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It’s possible they had a mild fever and a little rash and never sought the medical care that would have added their case &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;to a map&lt;/a&gt; kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s also possible that the virus was shed by someone traveling through from Montana, Washington, Canada or elsewhere. Maybe they went back to their hometown in another state and got tested and reported there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to know for sure, Hahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two states neighboring Idaho’s panhandle have each reported &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;10-49 cases&lt;/a&gt; so far this year, according to the CDC. But Idaho has had zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wastewater detection won’t be translated into reporting a case,” Hahn said by phone. “Right now, we really can’t say if this indicates one person or more than one person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dashboard for WastewaterSCAN, a national wastewater monitoring system based at Stanford University, first reported measles in wastewater treated at the Coeur d’Alene Water Resource Recovery Facility on July 29. Then, on July 31, it reported &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=CjUQASABSABSBjEwNTZmMFIGY2QwODhiUgZlNTk1ODVaB01lVl9Sb3l4KooBBmQxNDg5MMABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=d14890"&gt;higher levels&lt;/a&gt; of the virus in that wastewater. Still, the level of measles in the wastewater is marked as low: Two out of five samples in the 10 days prior to the last sample date were positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many communities in the state don’t even do that kind of testing, Hahn said. The city of Boise, which treats wastewater for itself, Garden City and Eagle, hasn’t detected the disease, according to &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=CjUQASABSABSBjEwNTZmMFIGY2QwODhiUgZlNTk1ODVaB01lVl9Sb3l4KooBBmQxNDg5MMABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=d14890"&gt;the dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only other community in the state that tests its wastewater for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus found in Coeur d’Alene’s wastewater is a wild type, a label used to distinguish between measles that is naturally occurring and the diminished form of measles in the vaccine, Hahn explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You may be aware that the measles vaccine is a weakened, live virus,” Hahn said. “So if you get your measles shot, you might actually shed a little bit of that virus into the sewer system, and that would just show up as a vaccine strain, not as a wild type.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said people should consider checking whether they’re protected, especially parents who are gearing up to send their children back to school or people planning to go on a trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine for measles is very effective because it offers, in most cases, lifetime protection, Hahn said. Children are recommended to get two doses, once when they turn 1-year-old and once before they start kindergarten, at about age 4 or 5. Boosters aren’t needed. But if you can’t remember if you were previously vaccinated, it doesn’t hurt to get the two doses again just to be sure, Hahn said. Or, you could get blood drawn and an antibody test that will tell you whether you’re immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="11" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe those old immunization records are still hanging around somewhere in a drawer, and you can double check,” Hahn said. “If you’re going to go and international travel, or you are a health care worker, it is recommended that you have documentation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Idaho has imperfect data, but according to the annual National Immunization Survey, nearly 80% of kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year were vaccinated, leaving about 20% unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374862"&gt; might have measles&lt;/a&gt;, or have been exposed to someone with measles, and develop a fever or rash, public health officials recommend staying home, isolating yourself from others and calling your doctor or a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="14" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles has been surging nationwide. The CDC reported on Tuesday the highest number of annual &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; since the U.S. &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/well/measles-doctors-treatment.html"&gt;declared measles eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. Most of the cases are connected to an outbreak that began in a Mennonite community in West Texas and spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html"&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the Texas and New Mexico cases have been among people who are unvaccinated, according to the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater testing is a valuable public health tool because it can detect the presence of infectious diseases, like measles, before cases are even reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like it’s a signal,” Hahn said. “Measles is very contagious, and so the wastewater itself is just our canary in the coal mine, as it were, telling us that measles is in the community. It’s just one more reminder that measles is still out there circulating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="17" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;August 5, 2025 at 11:27 AM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;div class="related-stories story-module"&gt;

Jackson County officials said those identified as having close contact with the TB case will be notified directly by a public health official and offered testing, education, and follow-up care at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our priority is the health and well-being of everyone in Jackson County," Public Health Director Anna Lippard said. "We are working carefully to identify and support those who may have been exposed, and we're committed to keeping the community informed every step of the way. If you have not been contacted directly by the health department, there is no need to seek testing at this time."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although TB is a serious disease, county officials say it is treatable and the risk to the general public remains low. Those with questions or concerns are asked to contact the JCDPH at 828-586-8994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/haywood-county-deputy-bitten-dogs-attack-unvaccinated-rabies-vaccinations-animal-services-incident-shelter-citation-fines-offense-community-pets-safety-precaution-cats-ferrets" target="_blank" title="https://wlos.com/news/local/haywood-county-deputy-bitten-dogs-attack-unvaccinated-rabies-vaccinations-animal-services-incident-shelter-citation-fines-offense-community-pets-safety-precaution-cats-ferrets" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;HAYWOOD COUNTY DEPUTY BITTEN BY UNVACCINATED DOGS, RABIES VACCINATIONS STRESSED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About tuberculosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;provisional report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the country has been increasing since 2021. The report stated there were 10,347 TB cases in the U.S. in 2024, up from 9,633 cases in 2023. North Carolina followed the nationwide trend, with 215 cases reported in 2023 and 250 cases in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active cases of tuberculosis often affect the lungs and spread through the air when coughing, speaking, or singing. It is not spread through casual contact, like touching surfaces, shaking hands, or sharing food or drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson County officials said those sick with TB often have one or more of these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough lasting more than 3 weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coughing up blood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Profuse sweating at night, often soaking the bed sheets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unintentional weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain or discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/prevention/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;CDC.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for more information on the disease and prevention measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:07:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwJBVV95cUxPRzZFTlU5NzJydFIxNTFNb3ctZ0FGOV85NmpYVXlENnB0NlhxQWVqY1JBa3dWRW1FbU45bFN0aGdCWjR4anFiUHdDSmpjVlJJYnRXTnA2c3ZUTWhQWWpVS3g5eHhKZXJ4R29sY3Q1MkxUSEpqemFyRWVtMGhjTnMtWXY0ZVdPcm5xdUl5Y2M2dTF2bVZGdkExM2F5VThTQWU4NWR4NjNLLWFyNHQwZW9MME92ZklSS0o5WDJRSGRhLURHWW5yZHZMRzFqN2E3R3pHNW9ONjN0OU05WGxtVUljODFrbWVQY1N0UmFnR0dPdUtNa2VDYjNmejc3QmVaa3pPbmp0d1hUZldabjZPem0zY1pkSFo0S0h5YlFv</guid></item><item><title>夏季COVID-19感染最严重的地方：阿拉巴马州的坏消息- AL.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W43EX56IP5DI7F5UPNQFDVFMRY"&gt;Alabama is among a handful of states with a high level of COVID-19 virus in the sewage system, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_2-weekly-national-summary" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_2-weekly-national-summary"&gt;according to data the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; released Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NGQEHWUEENBAZIQ2U7OIHK2WYY"&gt;Scientists test wastewater to determine the prevalence of infections, aiming to capture those who may or may not be symptomatic or visit the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VFUV3AFTJFARPGTNQFCS6SHFDY"&gt;While for most of the country, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5435181-covid-19-emergency-visits-increase/?tbref=hp" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5435181-covid-19-emergency-visits-increase/?tbref=hp"&gt;wastewater viral activity level for coronavirus is currently&lt;/a&gt; low, Alabama is one of seven states where it is high.

            For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/pakistan" target="_blank"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-vaccine-gaza-baby-225d4997a8dec1b2ce7d91711ee3d47d" target="_blank"&gt;against polio&lt;/a&gt; as part of a global campaign to wipe out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OjhtdlddI0" target="_blank"&gt;the paralytic disease&lt;/a&gt;. She hears their demands and fears. Some are practical – families need basics like food and water more &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-tetanus-vaccine-children-preventable-disease-e33a36e55d70381e4659874a2ecb371a" target="_blank"&gt;than vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Others are simply unfounded – the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gua00023b6nevuiq716@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren’t always stored correctly, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gua00033b6n8o0xllvk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In many places, our work is not done with honesty,” Ayaz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00043b6nx2cbw6wu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/world-health-organization" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and partners embarked on their &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-vaccine-campaign-who-gates-afghanistan-pakistan-341b1da7b7c33dbffa33fe9d9a52065e" target="_blank"&gt;polio campaign&lt;/a&gt; in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication — a feat seen only once for human diseases, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/d98f518c5f074c609a4e086eb1a1e02f" target="_blank"&gt;with smallpox&lt;/a&gt; in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-launched-polio-vaccination-campaign-96bb8b0644a6e4951d48a1a55bafce32" target="_blank"&gt;in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-polio-vaccination-campaign-suspend-9fc299a2e72dddf81f913da9f7f05e81" target="_blank"&gt;and Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00053b6n41axdbb7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio — which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours – has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00063b6n37vg7iii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Global Polio Eradication Initiative&lt;/a&gt; has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-united-nations-ap-top-news-pakistan-international-news-7d8b0e32efd0480fbd12acf27729f6a5" target="_blank"&gt;oral vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00073b6ndhdaxz4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-oral-vaccine-linked-to-rare-infection-risk-db2b278b7e4f9fea9a2df48b8508ed14" target="_blank"&gt;oral vaccine sparking outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI – one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00083b6nfuwvs9rq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Afghanistan and Pakistan – which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure – local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00093b6nk9lu35vu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GPEI_generalfactsheet_25-April-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;tout the successes&lt;/a&gt; – 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared – while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-gunmen-kill-police-polio-worker-northwest-7c027ca903c282ff3f0b82973cead3aa" target="_blank"&gt;polio workers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-polio-security-officials-attacked-balochistan-1acffdfd67252701828e570d142e3b75" target="_blank"&gt;security staff&lt;/a&gt; have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000a3b6nrq8ewtg2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO’s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers’ tailored response in resistant pockets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000b3b6n4ne2aqo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,” he said. “Let’s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000c3b6nb6dwu91d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000d3b6nj875d9k6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-business-philanthropy-berlin-c3e0441a186a17a060d83d9c7c7a9dba" target="_blank"&gt;the Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000e3b6nlb9qoede@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Continuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000f3b6n1cqfblxo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade – given to AP by current and former staffers – show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000g3b6ns8bipba6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000h3b6n00j9tzs0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, “vaccinators did not know about vaccine management,” citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting “more used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000i3b6ni09ouq8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, “resulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000j3b6n4wmzdo2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccination teams worked “in a hurried manner,” reports said, with “no plan for monitoring or supervision.” A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000k3b6n1pxq48ae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it’s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region’s poverty and transience.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000l3b6nb15lg81d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,” said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk to the press. “Many people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000m3b6n1ze41i8w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000n3b6nr41eqoad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have shared these problems with our senior officials,” the worker told AP. “They know about it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000o3b6nre1ob7j9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an email response to AP’s questions about officials’ knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted “operational challenges” in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has “robust monitoring and evaluation processes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000p3b6nzavuahwa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Worker Ayaz described “fake finger marking” — placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000q3b6n78qskce9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is so much pressure,” Ayaz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000r3b6ndsnduznr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease — spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles — was among the world’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-lifestyle-567c9fae1e50ba4f7d833dfb7f7617b6" target="_blank"&gt;most feared&lt;/a&gt;, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000s3b6n6a1rdbvp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000t3b6npmz4w1g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            WHO says that as long as a single child remains infected, kids everywhere are at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000u3b6n1z37ilp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eradication demands near-perfection – zero polio cases and immunizing more than 95% of children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000v3b6nmlw7kgb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But public health leaders and former WHO staffers say campaign efforts are far from perfect, and many question the oral vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000w3b6nkmct7okz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The oral vaccine – proven to be safe and effective — has been given to more than 3 billion children. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000x3b6n9e1yiv2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000y3b6nz3o30d98@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000z3b6neoxohht1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn’t enough injectable vaccine — which uses no live virus and doesn’t come with the risks of the oral vaccine — to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00103b6nmn6lzxxw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven’t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign’s problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00113b6nnjr5jfmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he’s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00123b6ncoaojjbq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s no management,” he said, citing a lack of accountability.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00133b6nf8wzspid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, former WHO scientist Dr. T. Jacob John twice emailed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus calling for a “major course correction.” John shared the emails with AP and said he’s received no response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00143b6n2ro4yejo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “WHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,” John wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00153b6n5rq5xmcr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a “core pillar” of eradication strategy and that “almost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00163b6nwl4qyb31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to step back and really care for the people,” he said. “The only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00173b6nskoj9m81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00183b6nhr5npn2a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, nearly all of the world’s polio cases – mostly in Africa and the Middle East – are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00193b6nisxm4mfr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong – particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-baby-polio-vaccine-who-aa79e32d45aa59f26274898c22885ba8" target="_blank"&gt;paralyzed a baby in Gaza&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001a3b6ncbkdafpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001b3b6neknycg9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/who-trump-tedros-global-health-a2eafc341cd2200e8800a2421d30bdfc" target="_blank"&gt;withdrew from WHO&lt;/a&gt;, and President Donald Trump has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-cuts-6292f48f8d4025bed0bf5c3e9d623c16" target="_blank"&gt;cut foreign aid&lt;/a&gt;. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001c3b6nrco6tzh1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001d3b6n9xuo8zbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn’t buy us any progress,” said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. “If this was a private company, we would demand results.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001e3b6nwy3321l3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001f3b6n1gyijra1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Karachi, locals told AP they didn’t understand the government’s fixation on polio and complained of other issues — dirty water, heroin addiction. Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001g3b6np69poajl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263" target="_blank"&gt;anti-vaccine sentiment&lt;/a&gt; growing &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a" target="_blank"&gt;in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it’s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001h3b6ncxtphpp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family’s objections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001i3b6nw7xkvbty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It results in disability,” said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. “They are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001j3b6noyhlasx6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/measles" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/tuberculosis" target="_blank"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001k3b6nh4a9k7iy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Polio eradication has created a monster,” Closser said. It doesn’t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/f081f1f8fbfa401ea148cea2fcf43c28" target="_blank"&gt;CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001l3b6nw6lgw2kb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Workers see that continued mistrust every day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001m3b6nmn22xqqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she’d prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it. They believe the false rumors that it will compromise their children’s fertility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001n3b6n86hgun41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I allow it,” the woman said, declining to be named over fears of family retribution, “I will be beaten and thrown out.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

in older adults, but also in younger patients — a trend we didn’t see a generation ago," said Den, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These cancers tend to be more aggressive, harder to treat and costly to manage," he added. "The sheer number of people at risk, combined with the rising obesity rates, means we’re looking at increased cancer burdens on individuals, families and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthcare systems;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthcare systems&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting healthy body weight through a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:balanced diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;, regular physical activity and less alcohol consumption are important steps toward reducing cancer risk, according to Den, as well as cancer screenings and early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As physicians, we advocate for broader &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:public health efforts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;public health efforts&lt;/a&gt; — like better nutrition education, access to healthier foods and environments that support active living," he said. "Additionally, new technologies and therapies represent a novel paradigm for the management of these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Preventing obesity is cancer prevention, and taking proactive steps now can improve long-term health outcomes across the population," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Promoting healthy body weight through a balanced diet, regular physical activity and less alcohol consumption can help reduce the risk of cancer, experts say.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sue Decotiis, M.D., a medical weight-loss doctor in New York City, noted in a separate interview with Fox News Digital that the use of obesity and diabetes drugs, like &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GLP-1 medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GLP-1 medications&lt;/a&gt;, has been associated with reducing cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is one of the most impactful medical advancements we have had in a very long time," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the doctor, "angry, inflamed fat cells," called cytokines, are produced in large amounts in obese individuals, which can "bully and override" the body’s normal regulations, often leading to immune disruption and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dr. Decotiis recommended seeing a certified weight-loss physician for an appropriate weight-loss plan, which could include GLP-1 medication.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to early cancer screenings, Decotiis recommends &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; as a critical way to reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shedding extra pounds can help reduce inflammation in the body by reducing cytokines, which also prevents cancers, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems more prudent to aggressively treat obesity and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, as well as clean up our food supply, instead of waiting for cancer to develop and hoping we can catch it and successfully treat it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take the state of being overweight and obese seriously," Decotiis advised.

(WLBT) - If you gathered 100 Mississippians in a room, statistically, at least 1 of them has an STD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The STD rate, &lt;a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-common-are-stds-in-the-us/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-common-are-stds-in-the-us/"&gt;depending on your source&lt;/a&gt;, is around 1,200 per 100,000 Mississippian, or 1 per every 100. The state &lt;a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2020/01/16/cdc-jackson-ranked-nd-highest-city-stds/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.wlbt.com/2020/01/16/cdc-jackson-ranked-nd-highest-city-stds/"&gt;has long been plagued&lt;/a&gt; by high rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In years prior, Hinds County&lt;a href="https://nyrequirements.com/blog/the_50_counties_with_the_highest_std_rates_in_the_united_states" target="_self" rel="" title="https://nyrequirements.com/blog/the_50_counties_with_the_highest_std_rates_in_the_united_states"&gt; had the dishonor&lt;/a&gt; of having the highest STD rate of any county in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;However, the state’s &lt;a href="https://olemiss.edu/news/2025/05/nycu-protecting-against-syphilis/index.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://olemiss.edu/news/2025/05/nycu-protecting-against-syphilis/index.html"&gt;current boom of congenital syphilis&lt;/a&gt;, which follows a nationwide trend, has the medical community now labeling it an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/media/pdfs/2024/10/2023-STD-Surveillance-State-Ranking-Tables.pdf" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/media/pdfs/2024/10/2023-STD-Surveillance-State-Ranking-Tables.pdf"&gt;2023 report from the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, Mississippi ranked 3rd in the country for reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis. In that same report, Mississippi ranked 5th for gonorrhea and 2nd for chlamydia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Syphilis, like other sexually transmitted diseases, is spread through bacteria upon contact with infected fluids; this usually happening through sex or various sex acts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The tiny corkscrew-like organism is a spirochete, or germ, of syphilis, as seen under the special "darkfield" microscope used in diagnosis of that disease, seen Sept. 28, 1937.  It's average length is 3/10,000 of an inch, or approximately the diameter of a red blood cell.  (AP Photo)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt;(AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;With most STDs, the symptoms can make themselves known in a plethora of ways, including painful sores, a burning sensation, or a type of discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;What makes syphilis different, and in some ways harder to detect, is that, at first, its symptoms can be minor - if any at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Dr. Kayla Stover, professor and vice chair of pharmacy practice at The University of Mississippi, explained that a symptom one might have in the first stage of syphilis is a painless sore, or chancre, that would go away even without treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;But though it is no longer visibly apparent, says Dr. Stover, the disease, if left untreated, could lie undetected in the body for years. And while lying undetected, the disease could slowly progress in its victim’s body, leading to more damaging stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“And each of those stages has symptoms that could be mistaken for something else,” Dr. Stover says, which is why the disease is often referred to as “The Great Imitator.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Unless you are testing for syphilis, you might not know it’s there,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In its second stage, or secondary syphilis, a rash might appear, usually on the palms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;It’s important to note here that in its early stages, syphilis is easily treatable, usually only requiring a shot of penicillin. But left untreated, the disease could continue to evolve, and one might enter the third stage: latent syphilis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In this stage, the disease could cause damage to internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The last stage, tertiary syphilis, is the disease at its most severe, causing damage to the brain or heart. Paralysis and dementia are possible during this stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;During all four stages, the carrier would still be infectious, possibly spreading it to various sexual partners. And if you are a mother, it could also spread to your child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;This is called congenital syphilis, and Mississippi has seen a 1,000% spike in the past few years, from 10 cases in 2016 to 110 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In congenital syphilis, the child is infected either in utero or as the child is being born. The complications of the now-infected child, says Dr. Stover, could either be mild or could lead to the child’s death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Also of note: a rising population contracting syphilis is the age range from 14 to 24 years old. In those populations, a threat from the disease is infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Those are some of the challenges [from obtaining syphilis],” says Dr. Stover. “As simple as you’re putting other people at risk, to you could be damaging, long-term, your life, your children, your expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Deja Abdul-Haqq, the director of My Brother’s Keeper, a local nonprofit focusing on public health, says they began seeing a spike in syphilis cases after the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;As for the reason for the spike, she said, “To break it down really simple: condomless sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;This April 1, 2016 file photos shows a billboard above a gas station that reads "Feel The Burn," a play on then-presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' campaign slogan, "Feel The Bern." It's actually promoting testing for sexually transmitted diseases. The number of cases of STDs - chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis - in California reached a record high in 2017,and officials are particularly concerned by a spike in stillbirths due to congenital syphilis, state health authorities said Monday, May 14, 2018. (AP Photo/Nick Ut, File)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt;(Nick Ut | AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Abdul-Haqq would say there is a lack of information regarding condom use in preventing sexually transmitted diseases. While this would seemingly be a basic concept to most, in Mississippi, it’s complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In Mississippi schools, sex-education classes cannot include instruction and demonstrations on how to use a condom. In 2015, a teacher in Starkville &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/3abd7740ee5b4d419fbdfbcd8a094d57" target="_self" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/3abd7740ee5b4d419fbdfbcd8a094d57"&gt;was suspended&lt;/a&gt; after a student in her class put a prophylactic on a cucumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;That same year, a teacher went viral &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alivelez/meet-the-brilliant-mississippi-teacher-who-used-a-sock-to-te" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alivelez/meet-the-brilliant-mississippi-teacher-who-used-a-sock-to-te"&gt;for side-stepping the condom rule&lt;/a&gt; by demonstrating how to put a sock on a foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Likewise, there is the lack, in Abdul-Haqq’s eyes, of information pertaining to modern prevention tools like PrEP, a medication which can prevent HIV infection, and Doxy-PEP, another medication that can prevent STDs such as syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Imagine if all of these mothers that were exposed to syphilis during sex would have gotten Doxy-PEP within 72 hours,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Dr. Stover would echo some of Abdul-Haqq’s same points, saying that Mississippi’s sex education has not been as progressive as other states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;And in the era of medications such as PrEP and Doxy-PEP, Dr. Stover says that people may not be as scared of unprotected sex as they used to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;According to recent data, Black men in Mississippi have higher rates of syphilis than others. A &lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/page//resources/6015.pdf" target="_self" rel="" title="https://msdh.ms.gov/page//resources/6015.pdf"&gt;2019 MSDH report&lt;/a&gt; found that of the 690 cases of primary and secondary syphilis that year, 338 were in Black men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The second-highest rate was found in Black women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“The information regarding the solution to these issues usually gets to the Black communities late,” Abdul-Haqq said. “So, it’s not so much the individual, it’s the environment that does not promote access to all of these prevention methods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Throughout the years, &lt;a href="https://www.sunherald.com/news/health/article125868159.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.sunherald.com/news/health/article125868159.html"&gt;billboard campaigns&lt;/a&gt; arose in the state and across the country in an effort to raise awareness about STDs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The billboards, initiated by the AIDs Healthcare Foundation, have phrases on them such as “STDs are Timeless” and “Testing is Caring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The same foundation &lt;a href="https://www.aidshealth.org/2025/03/ahfs-bold-billboard-campaign-stresses-syphilis-is-curable/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.aidshealth.org/2025/03/ahfs-bold-billboard-campaign-stresses-syphilis-is-curable/"&gt;also has a billboard campaign&lt;/a&gt; focusing on syphilis; those billboards reading things like “Syphilis is Curable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While well-intentioned, Abdul-Haqq says these billboard campaigns may not be doing enough for those who may need the information the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Culturally and aesthetically, it doesn’t engage the Black community, and the message is too vague,” she said. “We have to hit people with data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Want more WLBT news in your inbox? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wlbt.com/newsletter/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to subscribe to our newsletter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo13yd000o3b79ofc39vup@published"&gt;My husband had diabetes and obesity-induced erectile dysfunction for a decade, which, after significant weight loss, has improved. His dick does get hard now! But the moment it senses pussy, it can’t stay that way. Having penetrative sex is important to me, and I married him anyway because I know this is a fixable issue. Science cares about boners!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo140m000p3b79ftgfur13@published"&gt;He’s tried all the different drugs, and they help, but we still can’t get there. I even had to do IVF because we couldn’t even attempt to get pregnant the traditional way. At this point, I’ve given up and feel resentful about the IVF, frustrated that it took him so long to deal with it in the first place, hurt that he won’t keep looking for solutions, and sad that I’ve signed up to never get fucked again. He insists that non-monogamy is off the table for us. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="1" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo142n000q3b79au0ggxp9@published"&gt;—Never&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo146i000s3b79x7q4vuxd@published"&gt;It’s possible that erectile dysfunction medication simply isn’t enough. Often, soft or absent erections are at least partially caused by a person’s mental state, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/04/marriage-advice-wife-cheating-accusation.html"&gt;as licensed marriage and family therapist Moushumi Ghose shared with us in a recent column&lt;/a&gt;. So while your husband’s issue is probably fixable with the right support, it absolutely requires his own desire to find a solution, which very much seems to be absent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo148g000t3b79k0tckji8@published"&gt;Unfortunately, you married him thinking that as long as he found the right pill, this would be resolved. Sadly, this isn’t always the case—and that is indeed disappointing. Take some time to process your feelings around this. You might need several weeks. Talking with a trusted and sympathetic friend would be helpful. Once you’ve worked through any frustration with yourself, anger at a lack of education around these subjects, and new layers of emotions toward your husband, start considering your remaining options.&lt;/p&gt;

Think long and hard, with as clear a mind as you can, because saying any version of “I feel these awful emotions, and need you to do something in order to be willing to stay in the relationship” is nearly impossible to come back from when the answer is anything other than agreeable. Also consider whether you’re likely to be satisfied even if he does follow through on dildos or pumps and they work—will that be enough, at this point?&lt;/p&gt;

Let your husband know that you’re miserable. Leave space for him to process and respond, and be prepared to take a few-hour or days-long breaks, as this discussion might need to happen in chunks, for both of your sakes. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if staying young wasn’t just about how much you move, but how you actually move your body? A new study reveals that our muscles can produce a powerful anti-aging molecule. The molecule, called CLCF1, is released mainly during resistance training and seems to help preserve muscle strength, bone density, and overall resilience as we age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings could reshape how we think about exercise, aging, and even future drug therapies designed to mimic the benefits of physical activity. For years, scientists have known that exercise helps us stay healthier longer, but they could never figure out why the same &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/this-is-how-exercise-supercharges-the-immune-system-against-cancer/"&gt;workout that works wonders&lt;/a&gt; for young adults seems less effective in older people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new study offers a clue, and it all comes down to how our muscles talk to the rest of the body using tiny signaling molecules called myokines. CLCF1 is one of them. It turns out, while young muscles release plenty of CLCF1 during aerobic or strength workouts, &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/aging-might-travel-through-your-blood-and-this-protein-is-behind-it/"&gt;older muscles&lt;/a&gt; don’t, unless they’re properly stimulated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This research provides a biological basis for why exercise becomes less effective with age, and it lays the groundwork for developing new therapeutic strategies for healthy aging,” Yong Ryoul Yang, one of the study authors and an expert on aging at the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience &amp;amp; BioTechnology, &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/the-athletes-way/202506/strength-training-triggers-a-youth-boosting-protein"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-role-of-clcf1-in-healthy-aging"&gt;Role of CLCF1 in healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1) is produced by skeletal muscle during exercise and plays a role in supporting muscle and bone health. During their study, the researchers noticed that in young adults, both &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/back-in-the-gym-after-a-long-break-dont-worry-about-losing-your-gains-you-have-muscle-memory/"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt; and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) caused a rise in circulating CLCF1 immediately after exercise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They further discovered that people who were more physically active also had higher resting levels of the molecule. However, in older adults, the pattern was very different. Simply walking on a treadmill for an hour, a typical form of cardio, didn’t lead to any real increase in CLCF1 levels, not even after weeks of regular workouts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, what worked for them was a 12-week strength training program done three times a week. Older participants who followed this routine showed a significant boost in CLCF1 levels. Their muscles and bones began showing signs of rejuvenation, similar to younger individuals. The researchers believe this delayed but clear response highlights how essential resistance training becomes &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/biology/aging-isnt-linear/"&gt;as we age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We demonstrate that both resistance training for 16 weeks and resistance band exercise for 12 weeks significantly elevated plasma CLCF1 levels in older adults,” the study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to understand why older muscles weren’t responding well to cardio, the team dug deeper. They studied mice and found the same trend. Older mice didn’t produce much CLCF1 after aerobic exercise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when scientists gave the mice recombinant CLCF1, a lab-made version of the molecule, their muscle strength and bone density improved, even without exercise. The problem didn’t seem to be the gene for CLCF1 itself (which was still present), but a partner protein called CRLF1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our analysis demonstrated that CLCF1 expression remained stable with age, whereas cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1), a protein crucial for CLCF1 secretion, exhibited a significant decline in expression,” the study authors note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This protein helps transport and release CLCF1, and its levels drop as we age. Without enough CRLF1, older muscle cells can’t release CLCF1 efficiently during cardio workouts. Further experiments showed that when CLCF1 was blocked, the health benefits disappeared, proving that this molecule plays a direct &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/magic-mushrooms-slow-aging/"&gt;role in protecting aging&lt;/a&gt; muscles and bones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-resistance-training-is-a-must-for-healthy-aging"&gt;Resistance training is a must for healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study offers strong biological proof that resistance training isn’t just about building muscle; it may actually rewind the clock on some aspects of aging. For healthy aging, it is crucial, and possibly even more important than cardio, as we grow older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that even simple &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/working-out-gut-microbes-vs-cancer/"&gt;bodyweight exercises&lt;/a&gt; or resistance bands, done consistently, can trigger the release of beneficial molecules like CLCF1. Plus, the earlier you start, the more muscle and bone savings you’ll have for the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the discovery of CLCF1’s role in musculoskeletal health opens up exciting new possibilities. For instance, CLCF1 could also become part of a treatment for age-related conditions like sarcopenia (muscle loss) or &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/bone-atom-by-atom-04233/"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, further research will reveal new ways in which scientists could harness the potential of CLCF1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings collectively suggest that CLCF1 may contribute to the regulation of age-associated musculoskeletal deterioration, and warrant further investigation into its potential role as a modulator of musculoskeletal health during aging,” the study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59959-w"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Only one case of Powassan virus has been recorded on Martha’s Vineyard in the past 20 years, officials said. So far this year, three cases have been confirmed in Massachusetts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Powassan virus is spread to people by the bite of an infected tick and can be transmitted within just 15 minutes. Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, and vomiting. Severe cases can cause brain swelling, seizures, and long-term neurological complications. There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat the virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Most cases occur in the Northeast and Great Lakes region from late spring through mid-fall, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Powassan virus is carried by nymph and adult deer ticks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare,” Dr. Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor who has conducted research on Martha’s Vineyard, said in a statement. Collaborating with the island’s tick program, his lab tested more than 3,500 nymph deer ticks between 2021 and 2024. Between 1 and 2 percent of deer ticks were&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;infected, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This is a similar rate to that seen elsewhere in New England,” he said. “This suggests that many people who are exposed may successfully fight off the virus without ever knowing they were infected.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Officials did not disclose the age of the resident, or when they might have been infected with the virus. But the Vineyard Gazette reported the virus was found in a &lt;a href="https://vineyardgazette.com/news/2025/08/05/west-tisbury-infant-contracts-powassan?fbclid=IwY2xjawL_HqtleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFBZ1ROM3ZnSUZYMjBTUFVqAR4iytu9BPwdcqJ7dBPDpNTaLaAXYVIL_HM2KAEaihhy3fVWQVZGEMTmy85tkQ_aem__QwdTt8xnRrSGe0XoS_uQw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://vineyardgazette.com/news/2025/08/05/west-tisbury-infant-contracts-powassan?fbclid=IwY2xjawL_HqtleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFBZ1ROM3ZnSUZYMjBTUFVqAR4iytu9BPwdcqJ7dBPDpNTaLaAXYVIL_HM2KAEaihhy3fVWQVZGEMTmy85tkQ_aem__QwdTt8xnRrSGe0XoS_uQw"&gt;1-month-old from West Tisbury&lt;/a&gt;.

Left untreated, the virus affects the central nervous system, and once symptoms appear, it is almost always fatal. According to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html#:~:text=Rabies%20is%20deadly,disease%20is%20nearly%20always%20fatal." target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, human fatalities are rare and typically occur in people who don’t get treatment quickly after a scratch or bite from an infected animal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OGEFK77B2NEFFMYHTP4TP7CH6Q"&gt;Over the past five years, the county has seen one bat per year that has tested positive for rabies, according to Dr. Sarah Present, Clackamas County’s health officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UX3K24KQZJE4BEKM7F542EU3KQ"&gt;Health officials say the summer brings more encounters with bats — Oregon’s top rabies threat. About 8% of bats tested in the state are found to carry the virus, but officials say the actual rate in the wild is likely lower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YMSWXEVATVGDZKPWCBPS3RYOJ4"&gt;Foxes can also spread rabies, but health officials say that human encounters with them are uncommon.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1,500 to 2,500 Americans suffer brain abscesses every year, and around 10 to 30 percent die from the condition. Estimates vary for the UK but range from 200 to 900 cases per year with a similar mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bacteria from tooth infections are thought to travel from the infected tooth through the bloodstream, reaching the brain through the sinuses. Pus, which forms from infected tissues, then develops into an abscess. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sue said by the time Graham got to the hospital, his condition 'had deteriorated greatly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The ambulance brought us to The Walton Centre, and once there I knew it was serious,' she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Graham was prepped for surgery right away. The team was so professional, but it was obvious that speed was of the essence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgery to drain the abscess was a success, and Graham's condition gradually began to improve over the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It was a lot of information to take in a short time. I had the family around me, but I think we were all in a bit of shock. I was not well, so finding out what was going on quickly was key for all of us.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, his symptoms returned a few days after surgery, with doctors realizing Graham was suffering from sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sepsis is the immune system's extreme reaction to an infection that causes the body to attack vital organs. It's been &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13165721/sepsis-crisis-killer-infections-hospital.html"&gt;dubbed a 'silent killer' in the US&lt;/a&gt;, taking 350,000 lives each year or one every 90 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's usually treated with antibiotics for the underlying infection and medications called vasopressors, which divert blood flow back to vital organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this takes blood from 'non-vital' areas like limbs, increasing the risk of tissue death and amputations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Graham, pictured here with his wife, Sue, and two children, Rob and Aimee, still has communication and movement delays from the abscess and sepsis but is improving&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Graham was rushed to the operating room for a second time to drain the abscess again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He spent six weeks recovering, though scar tissue in the brain from the infection has left him with some communication and movement delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sue said: 'He still has issues with communicating and moving around, but we’re following the therapy and on our way to getting back to as close to normal as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Graham's two children, Rob and Aimee, raised about $4,200 for The Walton Centre Charity with a sponsored walk after being inspired by their father's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sue said: 'The hospital saved his life. For that there is nothing we can do to thank them enough! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But as a family we can raise some money and give something back to support the outstanding care they give to patients every day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said that Legionnaires’ disease can be effectively treated if it’s caught early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3oa1q"&gt;The affected ZIP codes include 10027, 10030,10035, 10037, and 10039 as well as surrounding communities, according to the city health department. Those ZIP codes generally stretch across Harlem from 116th to 155th streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="b82re"&gt;The city reported the first death on July 30. At the time, there were 22 confirmed cases related to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="95qt8"&gt;Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia, is caused by exposure to Legionella bacteria, which can grow in the water cooling towers perched atop many buildings across the city. People who inhale infected water vapor can be infected. It can cause flu-like symptoms including cough, fever, chills, muscle aches or difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8io47"&gt;The city said Monday that 11 buildings that screened positive for the bacteria have completed remediation efforts such as cleaning the affected cooling towers or making changes to the chemical solutions used to treat them. That follows a July 30 order by the city health department that called for all cooling towers in the affected area to be screened for Legionella and to take steps to remediate it if the bacteria was detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="e877r"&gt;The city has not released the addresses of the 11 Harlem buildings where the bacteria was detected. A public health lab is still working to identify which specific cooling tower or towers were responsible for getting people sick, said Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the city health department. Once the source is identified, the city will order a more thorough cleaning and remediation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9csin"&gt;These remediation measures are expected to prevent more people from getting infected, Gomez said. She added that the city still expects more cases of Legionnaires’ disease to be reported in the area because it can take several days after someone’s infected for symptoms to show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="arv4t"&gt;Health officials say the Legionnaires’ cluster is not tied to an issue with any building’s plumbing system and people living in affected ZIP codes are able to drink the tap water, shower, cook and use air conditioning at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2r6bo"&gt;City health officials say people are at higher risk for severe symptoms from Legionnaires if they are over 50, smokers, or have chronic lung disease or compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1do87"&gt;Over the past decade, several hundred cases of Legionnaires’ have been reported in New York City each year. Last year, 257 cases were reported, according to preliminary data from the city health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8eh91"&gt;In 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/5-deaths-at-nyc-nursing-home-blamed-on-legionnaires-disease/3956035/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;five people died&lt;/a&gt; from Legionnaires’ amid an outbreak at a Manhattan nursing home — the worst outbreak in the city since a 2015 outbreak in which a Bronx cooling tower was linked to 16 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2a61k"&gt;The disease takes its name from a respiratory illness that killed 34 people and sickened 221 at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/online/story-of-cdc/legionnaires/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bellevue-Stratford&lt;/a&gt; Hotel in Philadelphia, during an American Legion convention in 1976. After an extensive investigation, the disease was linked to a newly discovered pathogen, dubbed the Legionella bacteria, found in the hotel air conditioning system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 15:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, is the first interventional study comparing ultra-processed food (UPF) and minimally processed food (MPF) diets in 'real world' conditions, as well as being the longest experimental study of a UPF diet to date&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial split 55 adults into two groups. One group started with an eight-week diet of MPF, such as overnight oats or homemade spaghetti Bolognese. After a four-week 'washout' period during which participants went back to their normal diet, they switched to a diet of UPF, such as breakfast oat bars or a lasagna ready meal. The other group completed the diets in the opposite order. In total, 50 participants completed at least one diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provided diets were nutritionally matched in accordance with the Eatwell Guide, the UK's official government advice on how to eat a healthy, balanced diet. This included levels of fat, saturated fat, protein, carbohydrate, salt and fiber, as well as providing recommended intakes of fruits and vegetables. Participants had plenty of food (i.e. more calories than they needed) delivered to their home and were told to eat as much or as little as they wanted, as they would normally. They were not told to limit their intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eight weeks on each diet, both groups lost weight, likely as a result of the improved nutritional profile of what they were eating compared to their normal diet. However, this effect was higher (2.06% reduction) on the MPF diet compared to the UPF diet (1.05% reduction)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes corresponded to an estimated calorie deficit of 290 kilocalories (kcal) per day on the MPF diet, compared to 120 kcal per day on the UPF diet. To put this in context, the Eatwell Guide recommends a daily energy intake of 2,000 kcal for women and 2,500 kcal for men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater weight loss experienced on the MPF diet came from reductions in fat mass and total body water, with no change in muscle or fat-free mass, indicating a healthier body composition overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that, when observing recommended dietary guidelines, choosing minimally processed foods may be more effective for losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Samuel Dicken, first author of the study from the UCL Centre for Obesity Research and UCL Department of Behavioural Science &amp;amp; Health, said: "Previous research has linked ultra-processed foods with poor health outcomes. But not all ultra-processed foods are inherently unhealthy based on their nutritional profile. The main aim of this trial was to fill crucial gaps in our knowledge about the role of food processing in the context of existing dietary guidance, and how it affects health outcomes such as weight, blood pressure and body composition, as well as experiential factors like food cravings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The primary outcome of the trial was to assess percentage changes in weight and on both diets we saw a significant reduction, but the effect was nearly double on the minimally processed diet. Though a 2% reduction may not seem very big, that is only over eight weeks and without people trying to actively reduce their intake. If we scaled these results up over the course of a year, we'd expect to see a 13% weight reduction in men and a 9% reduction in women on the minimally processed diet, but only a 4% weight reduction in men and 5% in women after the ultra-processed diet. Over time this would start to become a big difference."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants completed several questionnaires to assess their food cravings before starting the diets, and at weeks four and eight during the diets&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were significantly greater improvements in the number of cravings and ability to resist them (craving control) on the MPF diet compared to the UPF diet, despite greater weight loss on the MPF diet that might ordinarily be expected to lead to stronger cravings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the MPF diet compared to the UPF diet, participants reported a two-fold greater improvement in overall craving control, a four-fold greater improvement in craving control for savoury food, and an almost two-fold greater improvement in resisting whichever food they most craved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Chris van Tulleken, an author of the study from UCL Division of Infection &amp;amp; Immunity and UCLH, said: "The global food system at the moment drives diet-related poor health and obesity, particularly because of the wide availability of cheap, unhealthy food. This study highlights the importance of ultra-processing in driving health outcomes in addition to the role of nutrients like fat, salt and sugar. It underlines the need to shift the policy focus away from individual responsibility and on to the environmental drivers of obesity, such as the influence of multinational food companies in shaping unhealthy food environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Stakeholders across disciplines and organisations must work together and focus on wider policy actions that improve our food environment, such as warning labels, marketing restrictions, progressive taxation and subsidies, to ensure that healthy diets are affordable, available and desirable for all."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial also measured secondary health markers, such as blood pressure and heart rate, as well as blood markers such as liver function, glucose, cholesterol and inflammation. Across these markers, there were no significant negative impacts of the UPF diet, with either no change, or a significant improvement from baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, there weren't significant differences in these markers between the diets, and the researchers caution that longer studies would be needed to investigate these measures properly in relation to the changes in weight and fat mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Rachel Batterham, senior author of the study from the UCL Centre for Obesity Research, said: "Despite being widely promoted, less than 1% of the UK population follows all of the recommendations in the Eatwell Guide, and most people stick to fewer than half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The normal diets of the trial participants tended to be outside national nutritional guidelines and included an above average proportion of UPF, which may help to explain why switching to a trial diet consisting entirely of UPF, but that was nutritionally balanced, resulted in neutral or slightly favourable changes to some secondary health markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The best advice to people would be to stick as closely to nutritional guidelines as they can by moderating overall energy intake, limiting intake of salt, sugar and saturated fat, and prioritizing high-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, pulses and nuts. Choosing less processed options such as whole foods and cooking from scratch, rather than ultra-processed, packaged foods or ready meals, is likely to offer additional benefits in terms of body weight, body composition and overall health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research UCLH Biomedical Research Centre and the Rosetrees Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;MPF have undergone very little alteration from their natural state, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish and dairy products like natural yoghurt. UPF have been significantly altered from their original form through processing, and typically contain ingredients not commonly used in home cooking, such as artificial flavours, preservatives and emulsifiers.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Not all participants lost weight, with 10 individuals in each group gaining weight. This is thought to be due to a lack of adherence to the diet, particularly on the second diet that they undertook. When the unadjusted results from the first round of diets (either MPF or UPF) were considered in isolation, the weight loss was greater than when the average across both rounds of diets (4.09% reduction for MPF and 2.12% reduction for UPF).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ) assesses overall craving control, craving for sweet foods, craving for savoury foods, positive mood, and the perceived ability to resist eating foods that are craved. The Power of Food Scale (PFS) assesses the appetite for and motivation to consume palatable foods when that food is available (but not physically present), when it is present (but not tasted), and when the food has been tasted (but not yet consumed).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Calcium is the main building block that gives bones their structure and strength," said &lt;a href="https://sph.uth.edu/research/centers/dell/dietetic-internship-program/program-faculty.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Diana Guevara, MPH, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a community health education specialist at The University of Texas Health Science Center's School of Public Health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to bone health, vitamin D's main role is to facilitate &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/best-time-to-take-calcium-11739405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium absorption in the gut&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Without enough vitamin D, calcium cannot do its job well," Allen said. "Pairing them ensures you're getting the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/calcium-supplement-health-benefits-190470" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bone-strengthening benefit from calcium&lt;/a&gt;."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has shown that taking vitamin D and calcium supplements together can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-increase-bone-density-11721928" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improve bone mineral density&lt;/a&gt; more than taking either supplement alone, specifically in older adults and post-menopausal women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Activated vitamin D binds to a receptor in the gut to start the process of absorbing calcium from food or supplements into the body," Guevara explained.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's always best to aim to get nutrients from food first if possible, Guevara said, as nutrients in food are easier for the body to absorb and utilize.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This may mean incorporating more &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/high-calcium-snacks-11765792" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; such as:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It may also mean consuming more &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-d-8348470" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; such as:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Allen said &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-d-8348470" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;food sources for vitamin D are limited&lt;/a&gt; as these foods only contain small amounts of the hormone, so supplements are often needed to help people get enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sunlight can help your body make vitamin D naturally, but too much sun exposure poses other health risks such as skin cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "About 10 to 30 minutes of sun exposure, a few times per week, can be enough for some people, depending on location and season," she said. "Darker skin tones may need more time in the sun to produce the same amount of vitamin D."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-you-may-need-a-supplement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; When You May Need a Supplement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you spend most of your time indoors or wear sunscreen daily, which Allen notes is important for skin protection, a supplement is often the most reliable way to meet your needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are going to take a supplement, Guevara said it is important to note that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/new-guidelines-supplemental-vitamin-d-8666125" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;upper limit of vitamin D for adults&lt;/a&gt; is 4,000IU per day. Since &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-vs-d3-7153133" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin&lt;/a&gt;, it can be stored in the body and build up over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before starting any new supplements, always talk to your health care provider to discuss what's right for your unique health and needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dairy foods like milk, yogurt and cheese are some of the best &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944074/foods-with-more-calcium-than-milk/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sources of calcium, vitamin D and potassium&lt;/a&gt; in the American diet. But dairy may be a concern for those who take some commonly prescribed medications. The combination may prevent the medication from working as intended. “The calcium in these foods [dairy and milk products] can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-your-calcium-supplement-may-interact-with-medications-8728344" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bind to some medications&lt;/a&gt; in the gastrointestinal tract, making both the medication and the calcium unavailable for your body to absorb,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinedsommer/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Christine D.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The calcium in dairy can form a complex with certain medications such as antibiotics (tetracyclines and fluroquinolones), which decreases how much of the medication and nutrient can be absorbed,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mytoolboxgenomics.com/about-us/erika-gray/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Erika Gray, Pharm.D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The tetracycline class of antibiotics is used to treat bacterial infections and includes antibiotics like demeclocycline, doxycycline, sarecycline, and tetracycline.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hypothyroidism is a condition that results in the underproduction of thyroid hormones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Levothyroxine, a medication commonly prescribed to manage this condition, should also be taken separate from milk and other dairy foods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Sommer recommends a four-hour window between levothyroxine and dairy products.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s also suggested to avoid taking these medications with food and instead take on an empty stomach for optimal absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bipolar disorder is a common mental health condition that is characterized by intense mood swings and changes in energy levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Lithium is often prescribed to treat bipolar disorder and while it isn’t required that it be taken separately from dairy, the drug may influence certain nutrient levels that are found in dairy products. “Long-term use [of lithium] can potentially lead to a buildup of calcium in the body,” says Amidor. “Monitoring how much calcium from dairy products and calcium supplements can help minimize this issue.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you ever find yourself down and out with the flu, you may be prescribed baloxavir as part of your treatment. This antiviral medication should not be taken with dairy products because of its interaction with calcium. The mineral influences the absorption of the baloxavir.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This is true for other &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-calcium-foods-that-arent-dairy-8661064" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium-rich foods like sardines and tofu&lt;/a&gt;, as well as calcium-fortified drinks. Over the counter medications like Tums antacids should also be avoided when taking this medication. “Tums is 500 milligrams of calcium carbonate, and the same cautions apply with Tums and these different medications,” says Gray.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A range of medications, from certain types of antibiotics to medicines used to treat influenza or hypothyroidism, can interact with dairy in the diet. But the good news is, you don’t need to completely eliminate all dairy. “Most of the time, it is possible to properly get the most benefit from your medication and still include dairy in your diet—just not at the same time of day,” says Sommer. The time of separation required varies by medication, so it’s important to check with your pharmacist for more information. Remember, dairy offers many &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamins-and-minerals-to-pair-up-for-better-absorption-11741465" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;essential vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt; in the diet while helping to fill the gaps of nutrients like calcium, potassium and vitamin D. The multiple health benefits make it worth spending the extra time to adjust your dairy intake to avoid interactions with your medications.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Does anyone else think we’ve all become a bit too protein-obsessed? Once upon a time, we got our protein from meat, fish, dairy and pulses. Now it seems like every consumable product comes loaded with it — from energy bars to protein-packed cereals and baked goods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m surprised no one’s thought of stirring it into their tea for a boost. Oh wait, &lt;a href="https://justea.net/drinking-whey-protein-with-green-tea-extract-health-benefits-and-tips/"&gt;they have.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say I’m anti-protein. Far from it. Protein plays an essential role in &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/functions-of-protein"&gt;body functions&lt;/a&gt; such as growth, immunity and digestion. It’s important that we get enough of it each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the million-dollar questions we should be asking are: how much do we actually need? When is it too much, or too little? And where should we be getting it from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protein is one of the three &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/"&gt;macronutrients&lt;/a&gt; we need in the largest amounts – the others being carbohydrates and fats. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/micronutrients"&gt;Micronutrients&lt;/a&gt; such as vitamins and minerals are important too, but they’re needed in much smaller quantities — typically milligrams, or even micrograms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protein is involved in a huge range of physiological processes. It’s of course crucial for muscle growth and repair. Bodybuilders looking for an Adonis (or Amazonian) physique often consume large amounts alongside strength training. But protein isn’t just about muscles – it’s a core structural material for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40606731/"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;, skin, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38006443/"&gt;hair and nails&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also plays vital roles inside the body. It allows &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9961/"&gt;muscles&lt;/a&gt; to contract, makes up digestive and metabolic enzymes, and is a key component of haemoglobin (which carries oxygen), ferritin (which stores iron) and antibodies (which fight infection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember: protein doesn’t work in isolation. Our bodies also rely on carbohydrates and fats — providing short and long-term energy sources that are just as important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates provide &lt;a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog3/node/1196#:%7E:text=It%20is%20interesting%20to%20note%20that%20gram%20for,4%20kcal%20per%20gram%20for%20carbohydrates%20and%20protein."&gt;four calories of energy per gram&lt;/a&gt;, and fats proide nine calories per gram. While protein can also be used as an energy source – also producing four calories per gram – carbs are more accessible for tissues to use rapidly. And crucially, building muscle also requires fuel. So, if your diet is too low in carbohydrates, your muscle gains may stall and you may find yourself depleted of energy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, protein is filling and can help reduce snacking. And too little protein can be harmful. &lt;a href="https://patient.info/doctor/malnutrition"&gt;Protein deficiency&lt;/a&gt; can occur due to inadequate diet, eating disorders, or conditions such as cancer, Crohn’s, or liver disease. Symptoms include fatigue, muscle wasting and a weakened immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because protein also helps regulate fluid balance in the body, a deficiency can lead to swelling or &lt;a href="https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/oedema-swelling"&gt;oedema&lt;/a&gt;. In severe cases, as seen in some developing countries, the condition &lt;a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/1022"&gt;kwashiorkor&lt;/a&gt; — marked by a swollen belly — can result from inadequate protein intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How much?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can sometimes be difficult to work out how much protein you should be eating each day, especially when different sources give variable advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good starting point is to consider your overall energy requirements. &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sacn-statement-on-expressing-fat-and-carbohydrate-recommendations/sacn-statement-on-expressing-energy-fat-and-carbohydrate-intakes-and-recommendations"&gt;Government recommendations&lt;/a&gt; suggest that up to 35% of your daily calories should come from fat, and up to 50% from carbohydrates. That leaves a minimum of 15% for protein — which for someone on a &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/lose-weight/calorie-counting/"&gt;2,500-calorie diet&lt;/a&gt; works out to about 95g of protein per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another calculation accounts for your body size too, giving a value more specific to the individual. Around &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096"&gt;0.8g protein per kilogram of body weight&lt;/a&gt; for a sedentary adult is advised. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For athletes and bodybuilders – who often aim for around &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a754243/how-much-protein-should-i-eat-to-build-muscle/"&gt;2g per kilogram&lt;/a&gt; — this can mean as much as 200g of protein a day. And that’s hard to achieve through regular food alone. For context, &lt;a href="https://www.egginfo.co.uk/egg-nutrition-and-health/egg-nutrition-information"&gt;30 eggs&lt;/a&gt; contain 200g of protein, as does 2.5kg of cooked beans. Certain foods have more protein (like the go-to &lt;a href="https://tools.myfooddata.com/nutrition-facts/100009715/100g"&gt;chicken breast&lt;/a&gt;), though the overall volume of food required can still be high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where protein powder often comes in — usually offering 20g–30g of protein per scoop – as supplementation. It’s absolutely fine to incorporate some powder or shakes into a healthy diet alongside wholefoods, which are the best protein sources. But it’s important to set limits – and avoid the temptation to go overboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Too much&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to be taking on too much protein? The answer is yes, if you’re regularly consuming more than your body needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excess protein is broken down and excreted through the kidneys, which may cause dehydration and place additional strain on renal function. Unused protein can also be converted into fat, potentially leading to weight gain. High-protein diets are sometimes associated with gastrointestinal side effects such as bloating, diarrhoea and bad breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while many high-protein foods are healthier, others (such as red or processed meats) may also be high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of serious conditions like heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes — protein is essential, but balance is key. Your daily needs depend on your body size, activity levels and general health. Consider your goals: are you aiming to maintain a certain weight, or looking to lose fat or gain muscle? Some starting points are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aim for at least 0.8g protein per kilogram of body mass daily&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance it with adequate carbs and fats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prioritise wholefood sources over protein supplements where possible &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase your intake responsibly if you’re training hard or trying to gain muscle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but be cautious with too high, sustained intakes — these may do more harm than good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who could do with a wee bit more in his own diet, I’m off to try that protein-in-my-tea trick. Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Lyme disease is pretty well established in Canada at this point,” said Dr. Thomas Daniels, the director of the Louis Calder Center, Fordham University’s biological field station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease-carrying deer ticks are&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-lyme-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mostly active;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; mostly active&lt;/a&gt; when temperatures are above 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and they thrive in areas with at least 85% humidity, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It likes to be in humid areas, not wet areas, but humid areas,” said Daniels. “If you sample on a lawn that gets baked in the sun all day, you’re not going to find ticks. You go 20 feet into the woods where it’s shady and the temperature’s generally lower and there’s more ground cover, you will find ticks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat from ticks and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/29/world/mosquitoes-spread-climate-dengue-malaria-scn?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mosquitoes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;, which drive transmission of diseases such as West Nile, dengue and malaria, is already increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of increases in temperature that we’ve already seen, because of human impacts on the climate, the temperature is already getting more suitable for transmission of disease here in the United States and North America,” Dr. Erin Mordecai, an associate professor of biology at Stanford University, said at a news briefing on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while climate change is contributing to the expansion of tick habitats, it’s not the sole driver. Human changes to landscapes also shape where ticks are found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s never just one factor, right?” Dr. Jean Tsao, a professor at Michigan State University who studies disease ecology, said at a news briefing. “In the continental US, most of the changes in the range is probably due to land use change affecting wildlife communities. Also management of wildlife populations, such as the white-tailed deer. That plays a major role for many of these ticks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is Lyme disease?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deer ticks, also known as black-legged ticks, are the primacy ticks that carry Lyme disease. During the nymph stage, when they are most active, the ticks are about the size of a poppy seed and are easy to miss. As they feed on blood, they can transmit pathogens, including the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. This transmission occurs through the tick’s saliva, which enters the host’s bloodstream during feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Fallon, director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, told CNN on Friday that infection can cause a range of multisystem symptoms. Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria can go to various parts of the body including the heart, central nervous system, the brain or peripheral nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The onset of Lyme disease may also present in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people think of the Lyme rash as a bull’s-eye target rash. In fact, that’s not the most common presentation,” said Fallon. “The most common presentation is more of a pinkish, reddish rash. But the main thing is that it expands in size from a small rash to five centimeters or larger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fallon notes that some people may also see more than one rash on different parts of their body. As the disease develops without treatment, more serious symptoms may emerge. Symptoms may last for months or even years, said Fallon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s recognized mainly by the rash early on, if you’re lucky enough to see it, and then later, by symptoms such as the neurologic symptoms that may manifest as a facial palsy or a meningitis causing severe headaches with stiff neck or shooting pains or severe stabbing pains,” Fallon said. There may be cardiac symptoms such as palpitations or slow rhythms; muscle pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be profoundly debilitating,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Protective measures are ‘not fool-proof’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels says that although there are measures that can be taken to decrease the likelihood of a tick bite, prevention methods are not foolproof. The most important protection against Lyme disease is tick removal as soon as possible, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key is to get the tick off you as quickly as possible. None of these [tick-borne] pathogens are transmitted very quickly, except for Powassan virus, which can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes. But the infection rate for [humans] is very, very low,” said Daniels. “For Lyme disease, you’ve got a 24 to 48 hour window of opportunity there to get the tick off, because it takes some time for the tick to gear up through its feeding to actually transmit the bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A sign warning people about Lyme Disease is seen at the Norma Johnson Center. - Andrew Dolph/Times-Reporter/USA Today Network/Imagn&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels advises people to wear more clothes in the summertime. “The longer we can keep the tick on the outside of our bodies and not on our skin, the less likely it is to find a place to attach.” Clothes can also be treated with permethrin, an insecticide that repels ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When hiking, Fallon advises people to stay on the trail, as ticks roam in leafy areas and wood piles. Daniels advises people to conduct a “tick check” for themselves and each other if they’re in an area with ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s helpful because the ticks may go behind your knee, or they may go and bite you in the back, and you can’t see your back or reach your back. Take a shower at the end of the day, because that may help to wash off some ticks that haven’t fully attached yet,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a tick is attached for a prolonged period of time, Fallon says that it would gradually “blow as big as a raisin” from continuously sucking blood. If you do find a tick, experts advise people to use tweezers to take out the tick from underneath its body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t try to burn it off with a cigarette. Don’t try to put anything toxic on it. Remove it with a tweezer,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:47:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1sRUlaZkRqU3pZWFZvX18xQlQ5bnhmY19kaV9XSjJzbXdiSllXVzR1THdUS25NMXpzOUp0X3hONkhQUHk3TzVjbHZzVGxpdDJPczdHU0UycGFNVnVHQjVpZklUQTl3TkFTQUp1MDZEYmd6Rzg</guid></item><item><title>夏天你应该继续服用维生素D补充剂吗？ - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5sUmhNUVFpemN1UGpnaEU1ZU5hY1FEa3dSWFV5N0VTYUVLRE9OeFVDUmxkYUkxM3FORG4yXzJhS0N4cmZuNjA3R1dLOVpScVBVUDRHcjhhWXZoTHQ3Z2dwMU91c1ZwVnc3T2NnS1VZTFo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Summer sunshine isn’t always enough to meet your body's vitamin D needs.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You May Not Produce Enough &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;You may not produce enough vitamin D from sunlight alone, even in the summer, since your body's ability to make vitamin D depends on several factors, like skin tone and geographic location.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining healthy vitamin D levels is important year-round because the vitamin helps your body absorb calcium to keep bones strong, supports muscle strength, contributes to mood regulation, and keeps your immune system strong.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Since vitamin D is stored in fat tissue and the liver, getting enough during the summer can help build up your body’s reserves for darker months with less sunlight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking a vitamin D supplement in the summer helps keep your vitamin D levels steady and supports your long-term bone, immune, and mental health, no matter the season.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most adults require &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/new-guidelines-supplemental-vitamin-d-8666125" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;600 to 800 international units&lt;/a&gt; (IU) of vitamin D daily. However, people at risk of deficiency, such as older adults or those with low sun exposure, may require higher doses. The National Institutes of Health recommends 600 IU for adults under 70, and 800 IU for those over 70.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, experts in clinical practice may suggest higher dosages, especially for those with risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your skin makes vitamin D when it absorbs ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from sunlight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The amount of sun you need to produce enough vitamin D depends on several factors, including skin tone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with darker skin tones&lt;/strong&gt; may need 30 to 60 minutes of sun exposure because melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color, naturally blocks some UVB rays, so more sunlight is required to produce enough vitamin D.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with lighter skin tones&lt;/strong&gt; typically require 10 to 15 minutes of midday sun on areas such as the arms, legs, back, or abdomen, two to three times a week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best time to make vitamin D from sunlight is between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when UVB rays are strongest.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-factors-affecting-vitamin-d-production"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Factors Affecting Vitamin D Production &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While skin tone is one factor affecting vitamin D production, several factors affect how much vitamin D your body makes from sunlight, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; Older adults (65 and older) don't make vitamin D as efficiently as younger people. They may need more frequent sun exposure to meet their needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air pollution and cloud cover:&lt;/strong&gt; Air pollution, such as smog, and overcast skies can block UVB rays from reaching your skin, reducing your body's ability to produce vitamin D, even when you're outside.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body weight:&lt;/strong&gt; While extra body weight doesn't affect vitamin D production, it does affect how the body uses vitamin D. Vitamin D is stored in fat tissue, so having excess body fat can make it less available for use throughout the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothing coverage:&lt;/strong&gt; Wearing clothing that covers most of your skin reduces UVB exposure and slows vitamin D production.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic location:&lt;/strong&gt; People who live farther from the equator, such as in the northern parts of the United States, Canada, or northern Europe, receive less direct sunlight and UVB rays, especially during the fall and winter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-apply-sunscreen-correctly-7483616" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sunscreen use&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher can block up to 97% of UVB rays, which reduces vitamin D production. While it's still important to protect your skin, you can spend 10 to 30 minutes in the sun before applying sunscreen to help your body make vitamin D safely.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time of day:&lt;/strong&gt; The sun's UVB rays are strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time of year&lt;/strong&gt;: People typically have less sun exposure in winter, producing less vitamin D than in summer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UV Index&lt;/strong&gt;: The UV Index predicts the sun's strength on a scale of 1-11+.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ways-a-high-uv-index-affects-your-health-11765558" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher the UV Index&lt;/a&gt; in your location, the more vitamin D you absorb. (However, increased UV exposure increases the likelihood of sunburn and skin damage, so proceed with caution.)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

            This year, people are seeking emergency care for tick bites in the highest level since 2017, according to data from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-research/facts-stats/tick-bite-data-tracker.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, and reported cases of Lyme disease have continued to&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/surveillance-data-1.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_1-interactive-data" target="_blank"&gt; rise through the years.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdygslsw00023b6n24we56m6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say the increases are driven by warmer temperatures due to climate change and the expanding presence of ticks in more areas in the US and Canada — including places where people are less familiar with the risks and how to prevent disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyf7wc7000e3b6nb5r5ag1o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we first started doing this [in the mid-1980s], there were very few cases of Lyme disease reported in Canada. Lyme disease is pretty well established in Canada at this point,” said Dr. Thomas Daniels, the director of the Louis Calder Center, Fordham University’s biological field station.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyf8cov000h3b6n00y641l3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lyme disease-carrying deer ticks are&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-lyme-disease" target="_blank"&gt; mostly active&lt;/a&gt; when temperatures are above 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and they thrive in areas with at least 85% humidity, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyf9idg000k3b6nwfge3lna@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It likes to be in humid areas, not wet areas, but humid areas,” said Daniels. “If you sample on a lawn that gets baked in the sun all day, you’re not going to find ticks. You go 20 feet into the woods where it’s shady and the temperature’s generally lower and there’s more ground cover, you will find ticks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyf9og6000n3b6nulry7cjr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The threat from ticks and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/29/world/mosquitoes-spread-climate-dengue-malaria-scn"&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;, which drive transmission of diseases such as West Nile, dengue and malaria, is already increasing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyf1apz00043b6nd42k6n9n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because of increases in temperature that we’ve already seen, because of human impacts on the climate, the temperature is already getting more suitable for transmission of disease here in the United States and North America,” Dr. Erin Mordecai, an associate professor of biology at Stanford University, said at a news briefing on Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxitkrz000l3b6no6gbnsh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And while climate change is contributing to the expansion of tick habitats, it’s not the sole driver. Human changes to landscapes also shape where ticks are found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxitkrz000m3b6nk6guf5ue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s never just one factor, right?” Dr. Jean Tsao, a professor at Michigan State University who studies disease ecology, said at a news briefing. “In the continental US, most of the changes in the range is probably due to land use change affecting wildlife communities. Also management of wildlife populations, such as the white-tailed deer. That plays a major role for many of these ticks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv200073b6n5gkbqd3p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deer ticks, also known as black-legged ticks, are the primacy ticks that carry Lyme disease. During the nymph stage, when they are most active, the ticks are about the size of a poppy seed and are easy to miss. As they feed on blood, they can transmit pathogens, including the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. This transmission occurs through the tick’s saliva, which enters the host’s bloodstream during feeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv200083b6n7n26109a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Brian Fallon, director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, told CNN on Friday that infection can cause a range of multisystem symptoms. Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria can go to various parts of the body including the heart, central nervous system, the brain or peripheral nerves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv200093b6n78lukcru@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The onset of Lyme disease may also present in different ways.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000a3b6nohswcovy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most people think of the Lyme rash as a bull’s-eye target rash. In fact, that’s not the most common presentation,” said Fallon. “The most common presentation is more of a pinkish, reddish rash. But the main thing is that it expands in size from a small rash to five centimeters or larger.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000b3b6nsytivmfu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fallon notes that some people may also see more than one rash on different parts of their body. As the disease develops without treatment, more serious symptoms may emerge. Symptoms may last for months or even years, said Fallon.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000c3b6nvnxbuw63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s recognized mainly by the rash early on, if you’re lucky enough to see it, and then later, by symptoms such as the neurologic symptoms that may manifest as a facial palsy or a meningitis causing severe headaches with stiff neck or shooting pains or severe stabbing pains,” Fallon said. There may be cardiac symptoms such as palpitations or slow rhythms; muscle pain and fatigue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyfpnof000w3b6nlc8qku8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It can be profoundly debilitating,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000e3b6n94oq9d0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Daniels says that although there are measures that can be taken to decrease the likelihood of a tick bite, prevention methods are not foolproof. The most important protection against Lyme disease is tick removal as soon as possible, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000f3b6n7140ba4k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The key is to get the tick off you as quickly as possible. None of these [tick-borne] pathogens are transmitted very quickly, except for Powassan virus, which can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes. But the infection rate for [humans] is very, very low,” said Daniels. “For Lyme disease, you’ve got a 24 to 48 hour window of opportunity there to get the tick off, because it takes some time for the tick to gear up through its feeding to actually transmit the bacteria.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000g3b6nxfokfxgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Daniels advises people to wear more clothes in the summertime. “The longer we can keep the tick on the outside of our bodies and not on our skin, the less likely it is to find a place to attach.” Clothes can also be treated with permethrin, an insecticide that repels ticks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000h3b6n1e3fq7kq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When hiking, Fallon advises people to stay on the trail, as ticks roam in leafy areas and wood piles. Daniels advises people to conduct a “tick check” for themselves and each other if they’re in an area with ticks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyft8x8000y3b6naarzv1hi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s helpful because the ticks may go behind your knee, or they may go and bite you in the back, and you can’t see your back or reach your back. Take a shower at the end of the day, because that may help to wash off some ticks that haven’t fully attached yet,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000i3b6nsqr8mpru@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If a tick is attached for a prolonged period of time, Fallon says that it would gradually “blow as big as a raisin” from continuously sucking blood. If you do find a tick, experts advise people to use tweezers to take out the tick from underneath its body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000j3b6nj2vtgu4w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Don’t try to burn it off with a cigarette. Don’t try to put anything toxic on it. Remove it with a tweezer,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

None of the sufferers shared family ties, yet all were regular foragers of wild mushrooms. A decade-long probe by French and American scientists traced the common thread to meals featuring the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;false morel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a deceptive look-alike of its gourmet cousin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="more-49586"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still remember my first mushroom hunt in the hills, &lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/antonio-gates-the-heart-and-soul-of-chargers-football-history/" data-type="post" data-id="49555"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;heart &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;pounding as I twisted mushrooms from mossy logs—only to be told later that one in ten was toxic.

Documented by the Motor Neurone Disease Association, that tragedy revealed how certain natural compounds can stealthily attack nerve cells. By comparing local diets, researchers discovered that gyromitra mushrooms contain hydrazine toxins acting on the nervous system much like the cycad neurotoxin did in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Environmental factors are likely contributors in up to 90% of sporadic ALS cases,” notes the Association, underscoring that even familiar foods can harbour hidden dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="False_morels_a_prized_delicacy_with_caveats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;False morels: a prized delicacy with caveats&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being cherished in parts of Finland and Eastern Europe, false morels carry a potential &lt;strong&gt;toxic punch&lt;/strong&gt;. Their hydrazine derivatives can cause anything from nausea to long-term neuronal damage when consumed repeatedly. The European Food Safety Authority recommends either rigorous identification by experts or steering clear of these mushrooms altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a backpacking trip, I once admired a friend cooking what we thought were true morels over a campfire—only to see her wince with stomach cramps later. Since then, I stick to cultivated varieties and leave the wild experiments to mytrusted foragers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Montchavin revelation is a timely reminder: when it comes to wild edibles, curiosity must be tempered by caution. If you love mushroom season, pair your enthusiasm with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/this-is-the-worlds-healthiest-food-according-to-scientists/" data-type="post" data-id="49507"&gt;food &lt;/a&gt;safety&lt;/strong&gt; protocols—consult field guides, join foraging groups or buy from certified suppliers. After all, the difference between a delightful dinner and a neurological nightmare can be thinner than a mushroom cap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Chicago Audible</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPSmN5VHo1WFdJOVdXR1R2RjUyLXh0VHlwVTVVMU1Jb3NFdXB6UE5hUVlBUm8wSUJPQ1oxanp1Z1JzTXljb25iaTJUWERKUkN1NU9MRFlqRnlqd1lvQXFwOEMzVlJpRGpmejBoMC1kcDY0OENYT0hGVGRHcHRlMkY5SW52X28zTE9GRHVzVWdTNWx3aWk4ODVaUk5Vam1mMzlMb0E</guid></item><item><title>华盛顿州东部医疗专业人士对PASCO水加氟明确表态- Tri-City Herald</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNTEJpN3JSWElmV1FYalA2Tkp2YTM0aUx6SkthZDlRUGVpSW9CWjJYaHkyTnBjWmhvWjM1dHNZeGVQSERoREw1Q19wYXVIYS1TM0NFaFk0S0xXNXRzMXpaTGNMa1ItajVSVE9tTkMwcTJhSnVCclE1TnNUSHFUMVladVFoc1HSAYQBQVVfeXFMTk1hWnlxZ3VOd1htM0kxRS1OY2lmOWRNV1ZOY1hWVEdPaHczWVRNMTN3YjdxbVpMU2lCeGJrQlR2V0lDQTl0bVh5dVdaMHRXZGw3OFIzeE5ja0x6d2NvTEZBT3Q5ZlJ4MWxxY0JNeTBNaWh1NmhDOV9mMnhhcHJGaTRacm1i?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="" class="paper story-body"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Pasco, Wash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals are urging the Pasco City Council to look at more than 75 years of data and scientific studies on the safety and benefits of adding fluoride at carefully controlled levels to municipal water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reduces cavities, it saves money in the long run for people’s health care and the levels at which cities provide fluoride in their water system are safe, said Dr. Steven Krager, the health officer for Benton and Franklin counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pasco City Council is considering ending the addition of fluoride to the city’s drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an initial discussion June 2, four of the seven council members said they favored &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/politics-government/article308517725.html"&gt;ending the city’s program to add fluoride&lt;/a&gt; to the city’s water supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;                        &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/su41v0/picture309591120/alternates/FREE_1140/Drinking%20Water%20Sink%20Glass.jpg" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/su41v0/picture309591120/alternates/FREE_960/Drinking%20Water%20Sink%20Glass.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/su41v0/picture309591120/alternates/FREE_768/Drinking%20Water%20Sink%20Glass.jpg" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/su41v0/picture309591120/alternates/FREE_640/Drinking%20Water%20Sink%20Glass.jpg" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/su41v0/picture309591120/alternates/FREE_480/Drinking%20Water%20Sink%20Glass.jpg" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/su41v0/picture309591120/alternates/FREE_1140/Drinking%20Water%20Sink%20Glass.jpg" alt="Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral.

Third Ave. A second feedback session will be held Sept. 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are asked to register if they plan to attend or speak virtually at either session. Registration information is posted at &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.pasco-wa.gov/1693/Fluoride"&gt;pasco-wa.gov/1693/Fluoride&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluoride has been added to Pasco water since 1998, to reach the level that the Washington state Department of Health says is optimal. Currently that is 0.7 parts per million, a boost from the naturally occurring level in Pasco water of about 0.2 ppm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The push to add fluoride to Pasco water initially came from what was then the Washington Dental Service Foundation Board. Childhood tooth decay was the worst then in the state in three counties — Yakima, Adams and Franklin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation approached the Pasco City Council, which voted unanimously to begin adding fluoride to the Pasco water supply using grant money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="10" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2015-16, Franklin County’s rate of dental decay in children was the same as that for children statewide, according to the 2018 &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Documents/1000/SHA-OralHealth.pdf"&gt;Washington State Health Assessment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams and Yakima counties were listed as among four of 20 counties with data available that had the highest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Lasting fluoride benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentist Spencer Jilek, who practiced in Pasco for 42 years before retiring, was on the foundation board that helped bring city fluoridated water to Pasco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="14" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We in Pasco have quite a few low income families who don’t have the advantages of dental insurance and regular dental visits,” Jilek said recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluoridated water has the biggest impact on low-income populations as the most equitable way to deliver preventative care, said Othello Dentist Chris Dorow, the president of the Washington State Dental Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you do it through water, it is going to reach everyone,” he said. “...

More studies need to be done, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such studies rely on data from India and China, where the amount of fluoride is not controlled as it is in the United States, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-117" class="zone zone-el" index="46" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;                        &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/dzvc3t/picture304345101/alternates/FREE_1140/Water%20Tanks%20Road%2068%20Sandifur%20Pasco%202025.jpg" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/dzvc3t/picture304345101/alternates/FREE_960/Water%20Tanks%20Road%2068%20Sandifur%20Pasco%202025.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/dzvc3t/picture304345101/alternates/FREE_768/Water%20Tanks%20Road%2068%20Sandifur%20Pasco%202025.jpg" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/dzvc3t/picture304345101/alternates/FREE_640/Water%20Tanks%20Road%2068%20Sandifur%20Pasco%202025.jpg" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/dzvc3t/picture304345101/alternates/FREE_480/Water%20Tanks%20Road%2068%20Sandifur%20Pasco%202025.jpg" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/public/latest-news/dzvc3t/picture304345101/alternates/FREE_1140/Water%20Tanks%20Road%2068%20Sandifur%20Pasco%202025.jpg" alt="Two water tanks near the intersection of Road 68 and Sandifur Parkway supply water to the residents in west Pasco." title="Water Tanks Road 68 Sandifur Pasco 2025.jpg" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                                        &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            Two water tanks near the intersection of Road 68 and Sandifur Parkway supply water to the residents in west Pasco.

The (students) weren’t going out for toothaches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists who see the value of fluoridated water are asking the Pasco council to consider the matter carefully, before making a decision on whether to end the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-120" class="zone zone-el" index="55" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we should be making ... emotionally-based decisions on topics like this,” Black said. “I think we really need to ask for our council members to do their due diligence and to seek out proper sources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;August 5, 2025 at 5:00 AM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;div class="related-stories story-module"&gt;

– indicate a new rise in infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the past, Covid has surged about twice a year, usually in the summer and the winter. But the pattern can change, as it does with other respiratory viruses – with late or early starts to the season and curveballs like double peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Each year has been different, so in some ways, this is more of the same,” said Sam Scarpino, a professor of health sciences at Northeastern University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cases are increasing or probably increasing in 26 US states, especially in the south and midwest, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html#:~:text=As%20of%20July%2022%2C%202025,not%20changing%20in%2019%20states." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the snapshot that we’re seeing right now, increases are happening at a relatively low rate, and that would indicate that we probably aren’t going to peak at a very high level. But again, this is early in this summer surge, so we really have to keep monitoring the data and paying attention to what it’s telling us,” Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt; currently spreading around the globe have known immune-evasion properties, Scarpino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You can look at the rise that we’re seeing, the fact that we know it’s an immune-escape variant, and I think we can be pretty confident that there’s some kind of wave coming,” Scarpino said. “Whether it’s going to be large or small, I don’t think we could really say one way or the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But “the vaccines are still providing some protection,” he said. “It’s never too late to get the booster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet officials softened the recommendation for children on Covid vaccines, and they removed the suggestion entirely for pregnant people, despite the clear benefits of the shot in reducing the risk of severe illness and death during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A new, more effective Covid shot from Moderna and the Covid shot from Novavax were approved only for people over 65 or people over the age of 12 with health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The independent advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/industry-biologics/covid-19-vaccines-2025-2026-formula-use-united-states-beginning-fall-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; that vaccine manufacturers once again update booster shots this fall to a more recent variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Covid boosters are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;usually&lt;/a&gt; recommended for all adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But this fall, the boosters may be limited to older people and those with health conditions, FDA officials &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“So it’s a big question mark, going into the fall, is who it’s going to be approved for,” Scarpino said. “If it’s not approved, can you still pay out of pocket for it? How much is it going to cost? And then are there going to be supply chain issues?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Health officials have also called for placebo trials for the boosters to judge their benefit to people without pre-existing conditions – but such trials would be unethical and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/02/vaccine-rule-change-child-trial-volunteers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;extremely difficult to conduct&lt;/a&gt;, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Clearly, the guidelines right now are focused on the populations that are more prone to have severe disease and severe outcomes. It’s always been good to vaccinate that population,” Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the Trump administration is moving away from the approach of immunizing broad swaths of the population – especially those most likely to get and pass the virus on, like children, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If you vaccinate broadly, you can reduce the spread of Covid-19 in the population,” Pekosz said. “The benefit, to me, is very clearly on the side of getting vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some of the pre-existing conditions &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929#f2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; by FDA officials include asthma, diabetes, depression and physical inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to that list, “basically everybody’s eligible for one of the vaccines,” Scarpino said. And doctors, including pediatricians, may also prescribe vaccines for off-label use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet the more restrictions are placed on vaccination, the harder it is to reach even the people who need it most, Pekosz noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Antivirals like Paxlovid could also see wider use, the experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We shouldn’t forget about the antivirals,” Pekosz said. “Those don’t seem to be the target of more restrictive use by the CDC or the FDA, so those will be available for people if they do get infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A program to make Paxlovid &lt;a href="https://www.paxlovid.com/paxcess" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more affordable&lt;/a&gt; to those who need it is slated to end in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The benefits of antiviral treatment are very clear with respect to hospitalization and mortality decreases,” Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Paxlovid is still highly effective against current variants, Scarpino said. “There’s a whole bunch of good reasons to get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rates of hospitalizations and deaths in recent waves have dropped among adults compared with earlier Covid waves, but the virus remains deadly. An &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; 35,000 to 54,000 people in the US have died of Covid since October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children continue to see hospitalizations &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/covid-net/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; from Covid similar to previous years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Covid cases can be less severe because of immunity – from prior infection or from vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s not so much that the virus has become less dangerous, it’s that we have immunity, so we fight off the virus more efficiently than we did early in the pandemic,” Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That’s why vaccinations remain a key part of controlling Covid, he said. Without boosters, people become more susceptible to severe illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;23%&lt;/a&gt; of adults had received updated Covid boosters as of April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About 5.6% of children aged six months to four years are vaccinated against Covid, and about 15% of children aged five to 17 are vaccinated, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/child-coverage-vaccination.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Children’s cases are always surging, because children don’t have much immunity to Covid,” Pekosz said. “Covid cases are really occurring in children at a very high level right now. It’s not nearly as dangerous in children as it is in adults, but it still causes a lot of hospitalizations in children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hospitalizations and deaths are not the only ways to measure the damage and disruption wrought by Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the Trump administration has not released updated data on long Covid, an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;5.3%&lt;/a&gt; of all adults in the US said they were currently experiencing long-term Covid symptoms as of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even in times of lower transmission, Covid still circulates, with &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;149 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the week ending 28 June, the last week for which the CDC shares full mortality data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s still a little surprising that it’s around all year,” said Pekosz. During lull times, “we’re not seeing it disappear completely, like we do with other respiratory viruses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When it comes to keeping rates of Covid low, “it’s all the same stuff we usually go over,” Pekosz said – getting vaccinated, taking precautions like masking and using air purifiers, and staying home if you’re sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But it’s just a very different environment these days. When the government doesn’t use the science to drive their decision making, you can see the confusion that it puts into the general public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBrWTQtMUszbFZobWFCdjlUWndHNjVBWHliVmJvZ01BSDVUaXVwTW95YXlfRnNxdHFsOVk2V2E5VDNMTzNzd1JUZkVWREZ2YlRTTG5iSkVsV3loSEJqUUgwaDJWQ1ZaR0pNaU4zM0hwUHZQM1VHYWc</guid></item><item><title>被夏天的鼻涕声击中？以下是您需要了解的关于今年夏季感冒、新冠肺炎疫情的信息- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9JdkY2VGxvRFJXNk1LcWpoek1VQWN6ZUhaZXlRVFhSZlJweWVhYVQwWXhxOElQQlh1UE1OX0hqOEdJejdhVlFBekFkOEYtcGVsQy1UTWpGOVFId3Q3eXJHNnpIcHBmR1c4LUJQTG9kTlZnUXpEdEJF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer heat, outdoor fun ... and cold and flu symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three may not go together in many people's minds: partly owing to common myths about germs and partly because many viruses really do have lower activity levels in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is possible to get the sniffles — or worse — in the summer. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Federal data released Friday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Federal data released Friday&lt;/a&gt;, for example, shows COVID-19 is trending up in many parts of the country, with emergency department visits up among people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what to know about summer viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much are colds and flu circulating right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of people seeking medical care for three key illnesses — COVID-19, flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV — is currently low, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(MORE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-rise-121000999.html" rel data-ylk="slk:Flesh-Eating Bacteria Cases Rising Along Gulf Coast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flesh-Eating Bacteria Cases Rising Along Gulf Coast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu is trending down and RSV was steady this week.

So it's true that fewer people get stuffy noses and coughs in the summer — but cold weather itself does not cause colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(MORE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://weather.com/forecast/regional/video/poor-air-quality-in-northern-us-impacting-millions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Poor Air Quality In Northern U.S. Impacting Millions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor Air Quality In Northern U.S. Impacting Millions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just about seasonality. The other factor is our behavior, experts say. Nice weather means people are opening windows and gathering outside where it's harder for germs to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But respiratory viruses are still around. When the weather gets too hot and everyone heads inside for the air conditioning, doctors say they start seeing more sickness. In places where it gets really hot for a long time, summer can be cold season in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I grew up on the East Coast and everybody gets sick in the winter,” said Dr. Frank LoVecchio, an emergency room doctor and Arizona State University researcher. “A lot of people get sick in the summer here. Why is that? Because you spend more time indoors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you get another COVID-19 booster now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who are otherwise healthy, timing is a key consideration to getting any vaccine. You want to get it a few weeks before that big trip or wedding, if that's the reason for getting boosted, doctors say. But, for most people, it may be worth waiting until the fall in anticipation of winter cases of COVID-19 really tick up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want to be fully protected at the time that it's most important for you,” said Dr. Costi Sifri, of the University of Virginia Health System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A family is sitting in a public park and blowing their noses in handkerchiefs due to the problems with cold or flu.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at higher risk of complications should always talk with their doctor about what is best for them, Sifri added. Older adults and those with weak immune systems may need more boosters than others, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are more younger kids getting sick with COVID-19?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the CDC noted emergency room visits among children younger than 4 were rising. That makes sense, Blumberg said, because many young kids are getting it for the first time or are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in May that the shots would no longer be recommended for healthy kids, a decision that health experts have said lacks scientific basis.

Different types of Vibrio bacteria cause different infections, with Vibrio vulnificus causing the "most serious forms of vibriosis," according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The potentially fatal infection can quickly result in tissue damage and spreading blisters, low blood pressure, fever, organ damage, sepsis and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is often referred to as "flesh-eating" because it can also cause necrotizing fasciitis, a bacterial infection that destroys muscle and skin tissue, causing flesh around wounds to die, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt; While it is possible, Vibrio vulnificus is not considered to be the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The bacteria and resulting infections are rare but can be life-threatening. Without treatment, death can occur in just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How does 'flesh-eating' bacteria enter the body?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus requires salt water for survival and thrives in warm, brackish water where a stream or river meets seawater, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/prevention/index.html#cdc_prevention_pre-protect-wounds-from-coastal-waters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most infections occur when contaminated water is swallowed or gets into an open wound, such as a cut or scrape. It can enter through broken skin but cannot penetrate unharmed skin.

That is, until a relatively mild illness spiraled into a near-death experience and left their son with lifelong health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In December 2023, Nicholas’ parents took him to Methodist Southlake Medical Center first for a relatively mild sickness and then again for a much more severe illness. The family alleges that the medical providers for that second visit ignored the boy’s obvious signs of medical distress, sending him home when he should’ve been admitted. As a result, the family says, Nicholas nearly died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__YgCAW md_pb-9 md_mb-7 md_pt-9 md_mt-7 pb-6 mb-9 px-9 w-full h-64 bg-blue-light border-t border-b border-gray-light pt-6 mt-9"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__P1yIN inline-flex col-span-1 row-span-1 pb-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__vRSrF flex-auto w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__3hNhh primaryBold primaryBold-50 mb-3"&gt;Business Briefing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__zWZy- mb-4"&gt;Become a business insider with the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For more than a year and a half now, Nicholas and his parents have been coping with the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/FDKATIUUNFAPVEJ4SBMMKHSPTY.jpg?auth=920a852105d309da33cb671e839525bcd125c6bae61a81a050afa631b6c90438&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/FDKATIUUNFAPVEJ4SBMMKHSPTY.jpg?auth=920a852105d309da33cb671e839525bcd125c6bae61a81a050afa631b6c90438&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/FDKATIUUNFAPVEJ4SBMMKHSPTY.jpg?auth=920a852105d309da33cb671e839525bcd125c6bae61a81a050afa631b6c90438&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="Nicholas Mata photographed with his mother Reasa Selph and father is Antonio Mata on Monday,..."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Nicholas Mata photographed with his mother Reasa Selph and father is Antonio Mata on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N. Pool / Staff Photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The 12-year-old is still in regular medical appointments and treatments. He’s spent much of this summer at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and the family recently learned that Nicholas’ heart isn’t functioning correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;And the family believes it all could’ve been prevented. As they juggle ongoing medical care, they’ve also set off on a quest for accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph filed a complaint with federal regulators, who then issued a violation notice to the hospital. The family also recently refiled a lawsuit against the Southlake hospital, naming the hospital itself, Dr. Teresa Proietti and the physicians group Emergency Medicine Consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Proietti did not respond to phone calls to her office. In a succinct legal filing, the doctor denied the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;A spokesperson for the Methodist Health System said in an email that the system does not comment on pending litigation. A spokesperson for Emergency Medicine Consultants similarly declined to comment on active litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;At the end of July, however, Methodist Health System submitted legal filings to the court, saying the lawsuit’s assertions are vague and not sufficiently supported by the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In the filing, the health system also wrote that it is not responsible for Proietti’s actions. The events of December 2023 were “wholly and completely unavoidable and without any negligence on the part of” the hospital, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DQ2PEVDVYZFGZBXDCJ7SY5PMPE.jpg?auth=8eb03109b74a45a2a2882374cdbd88cf63d82af2db9ae157351ab3cf9b9bbe94&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DQ2PEVDVYZFGZBXDCJ7SY5PMPE.jpg?auth=8eb03109b74a45a2a2882374cdbd88cf63d82af2db9ae157351ab3cf9b9bbe94&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DQ2PEVDVYZFGZBXDCJ7SY5PMPE.jpg?auth=8eb03109b74a45a2a2882374cdbd88cf63d82af2db9ae157351ab3cf9b9bbe94&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="Reasa Selph holds hands with her son Nicholas Mata during an interview on Monday, July 14,..."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Reasa Selph holds hands with her son Nicholas Mata during an interview on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N. Pool / Staff Photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The flurry of activity in the wake of Nicholas’ near-death experience is a testament to the amount of attention one family can garner, when they have the time and resources to dedicate. But they know not every family would be able to put the same energy and money into the cause — and, to Selph, that’s enough reason in itself to keep pushing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;The timeline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;It started with what seemed to be a case of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In mid-December 2023, Nicholas was a fifth grader at Liberty Christian School in Argyle. The school sent him home sick, and Selph then took him to get medical care at Methodist Southlake. The hospital’s providers gave Nicholas an IV and sent him home to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For a while, it seemed like he was getting better. By the 22nd, though, Nicholas had gone downhill. By the 23rd, Selph and Mata could barely get Nicholas to move around, so they took him back to Methodist Southlake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We were there for a little under two hours,” Selph said, “and they just said, ‘Hey, it’s viral. Go home. He’ll be fine.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;On Christmas morning, Nicholas was doing markedly worse, Selph said. He could barely get out of bed. He wouldn’t eat. And Selph distinctly remembers that her son looked gray and yellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MC5GP77YU5FJ3NPQGEYSXWIM7A.jpg?auth=7b2b78242485c164eb410319061fbee3d10665f88ece99f0c36ad9d56d1f1d90&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MC5GP77YU5FJ3NPQGEYSXWIM7A.jpg?auth=7b2b78242485c164eb410319061fbee3d10665f88ece99f0c36ad9d56d1f1d90&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MC5GP77YU5FJ3NPQGEYSXWIM7A.jpg?auth=7b2b78242485c164eb410319061fbee3d10665f88ece99f0c36ad9d56d1f1d90&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="Family photos of Nicholas Mata on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Family photos of Nicholas Mata on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N. Pool / Staff Photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;This time, the family took Nicholas to Cook Children’s Medical Center in Fort Worth, where the medical providers swarmed the sick fifth grader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“I had no idea until later how really, really sick he was,” Selph said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;On that first day at Cook Children’s, Selph remembers Nicholas was throwing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“He starts to throw up and I grab the blue bag and I give him the blue bag and we’re holding it,” Selph said. “And he vomits a pint of blood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For Selph, it was one of the scariest moments of her son’s illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The Cook Children’s providers determined Nicholas was in septic shock. Septic shock is an extreme response to an infection, and it can worsen rapidly as the body’s organs shut down. The condition has a high mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“They came in and they just said, ‘We don’t know how this is going to turn out. We’d like to bring in a priest for you,’” Selph said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Nicholas had a weeklong stay in the ICU at Cook Children’s, punctuated by several invasive procedures including intubation. After the ICU, he spent another several weeks in the hospital before he was discharged. In total, he was hospitalized for more than a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Nicholas survived, although Selph said there were long stretches where she thought he wouldn’t. Afterward, he had to relearn how to walk. And now, he has health complications that will likely be lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Importantly for Nicholas, some of the complications may also infringe on his ability to play football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/I6AZ4UAGTJCT5EGKJHB4MRXZVI.jpg?auth=3c08649f4e278d9b878c86c3caea2adf7a3b38c155d3bc62e3e9e8f2349214ba&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/I6AZ4UAGTJCT5EGKJHB4MRXZVI.jpg?auth=3c08649f4e278d9b878c86c3caea2adf7a3b38c155d3bc62e3e9e8f2349214ba&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/I6AZ4UAGTJCT5EGKJHB4MRXZVI.jpg?auth=3c08649f4e278d9b878c86c3caea2adf7a3b38c155d3bc62e3e9e8f2349214ba&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="A Liberty Christian hat with an inspirational message to Nicholas Mata from Jason Witten is..."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;A Liberty Christian hat with an inspirational message to Nicholas Mata from Jason Witten is displayed at Mata’s home on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N. Pool / Staff Photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The family believes the worst of the illness and the complications could’ve been avoided if Methodist Southlake providers had taken better care of Nicholas on his second visit to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Pushing for accountability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In the months since Nicholas was discharged from the hospital, his family — and especially Selph — has searched for ways to hold Methodist Southlake and its providers responsible for what they see as medical malpractice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph filed a complaint with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates hospitals that accept Medicare and Medicaid, even if the patient in question has other forms of health care coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In mid-April 2024, according to a CMS document that Selph provided to &lt;i&gt;The Dallas Morning News&lt;/i&gt;, the federal agency found that the Southlake hospital had failed to meet standards of care in Nicholas’ case. The document does not specifically name Nicholas, but it describes the unnamed patient as an 11-year-old and describes the same medical situation. Selph also said the document does refer to her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Specifically, the federal notice says Methodist Southlake failed to provide a proper medical screening and “discharged Patient #1 with a diagnosis of upper respiratory infection despite Patient #1 having abnormal labs, elevated heart rate and decreased blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The family also filed a civil lawsuit against the hospital in September, but dropped it in favor of pushing for legislative action during Texas’ 2025 session. Now that the session is over, the family has refiled that Tarrant County lawsuit against Methodist Southlake and the treating doctor, Proietti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;They argue the hospital and the medical team were negligent in their treatment of Nicholas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;While a spokesperson for Methodist declined to comment, attorneys for the health system wrote in legal filings that the family’s claims are not supported by the evidence and that the hospital is not responsible for Proietti’s actions. Proietti wrote in a short legal filing at the beginning of August that she denies the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph is also pushing for repercussions from the Texas Medical Board and the Texas Board of Nursing, and she’s looking into possible criminal charges, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;All of these paths take time. Selph said it’s been an enormous amount of work to file and follow up with the various enforcement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;But Shane Langston, the family’s attorney, said the case is strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“I’ve been doing this a long time,” Langston said, “and we don’t file a case like this, against medical providers, unless it’s legitimate and strongly supported by our medical specialists who reviewed the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;‘There’s got to be change’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;There are moments of the past year and a half that are seared into their memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph remembers when they got home from the hospital, after Nicholas was discharged, and all of their Christmas decorations were up. It was, by then, well over a month since the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The whole family struggled with the strong association they had between Christmas — a favorite holiday — and Nicholas’ near death. Nicholas’ dad, Antonio Mata, said that when he thinks back on how sick his son was that day, he’s washed with guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“How could I miss what he was trying to tell us?” Mata said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For their next Christmas, in 2024, Selph organized a wild departure from their usual rituals. They spent the day indoor skydiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“This past Christmas, we had a really tough time, because nobody wanted to be here,” Selph said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The family doesn’t want anyone else to experience what they have experienced: the panic, the weeks at the hospital, the guilt, the rearranging of their entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We don’t want this to happen to someone else,” Selph said. “And if we can prevent just one person from going through this, that would be a win for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;It could be months or years before their lawsuit is resolved, and the legal process can be both costly and time intensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“But it’s worth it,” Mata said. “There’s got to be change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dallas News</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 11:01:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxPSUFETk81Tjgyd2wwcVZXSHd4ZUZvTUJZVVNXODgwUnYxVDJ4MS1MY3JiQnJ3ejBHM0JMWnRlQjkwZmFaclFud2w1WThLSXJMWFNkZmc0VnhXRjVsSTZkV2ZiNEx5OEtybVlGNlN4NmRuSnFwUW5jYUFVclIyTlNKeXRQWTlIWmptc1Y3M1hJNV8tRV9HOGNIQ1ZrcEZULVZCNkNUM1BhZ2V3aFEtLWpyYW1SVDI0ZV9zT0M3VUJzZ01pek1mb3kzazVLT3JJcklKMmtaNVRFM29zdlp1Z1o5Nm9n</guid></item><item><title>睡不着？这5种瑜伽姿势比褪黑激素更快击倒我- CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOWUJNb3pXNHF4OWhGbEk2amlGRGlKT1ZlbXhwSU0tMFo5UlNQb29jXzhUUnFTUHAzMFVQZnFDMW1HajBUZm9XNFpGak5DWGk3OGoxNGxwNVdEVzhEdlFoQ3BZZjBxZ2hnTU5oOWFSMDZScVRlZGVMcnNqdkZsMHJCQkFaSTNPd2xoaEtxc0FjdmU4SEtwQ2VtNnNnS05hNmlwaGxz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;Struggling to fall asleep even after upgrading your mattress, trying sleep aids, or turning on your favorite white noise? You're far from alone. According to a 2024 CNET survey, more than half of adults use some form of sleep support - yet restful nights still feel out of reach for many. While expensive gadgets and blackout curtains can help, one low-cost, effective option might already be right at your fingertips: yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;But here's the catch.

To help you avoid trial-and-error frustration, we consulted an expert to pinpoint the exact poses that promote calm, lower stress levels and prepare your body for deeper, longer sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for other ways to get better rest, then you're in luck.

Yoga and breathing techniques help calm your nervous system and reduce cortisol, which puts your body in a more relaxed state, ideal to help you fall asleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Calming the mind and body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Chloe Kernaghan, co-founder of yoga studio &lt;a href="https://www.skyting.com/" target="_self"&gt;Sky Ting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/start-a-home-yoga-practice-everything-you-need/" target="_self"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; helps you sleep better in two ways: It helps relax a racing mind and calms the nervous system. "Yoga as a practice is centered around finding stillness in the mind, which more often than not is the opposite state the mind is in when we're having sleep issues (i.e., your mind is racing)," Kernaghan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga includes elements of mindfulness, but it's also a physical practice known for helping calm the body's physical stress response, or the nervous system, through breathwork and performing specific poses. Kernaghan explains, "The physical practice can help calm the nervous system and switch you from sympathetic mode to a parasympathetic mode, ideal for resting and deep sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reducing cortisol levels before bed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research seems to agree with Kernaghan, as recent studies suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768222/" target="_self"&gt;engaging in yoga may lead to reduced levels of cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, the hormone associated with stress. The extent of cortisol reduction may vary depending on factors such as the frequency and intensity of yoga practice. Additionally, some studies have shown promising results regarding yoga's impact on depression symptoms. Yoga can complement traditional treatment approaches and promote overall well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean for your sleep? Well, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2021.694046/full#B1" target="_self"&gt;cortisol levels have a significant influence on sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt;. Higher cortisol levels are often associated with difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. A &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6393899/" target="_self"&gt;study conducted in 2019&lt;/a&gt; found that incorporating yoga into one's routine can positively affect insomnia symptoms. These findings suggest that practicing yoga may offer potential benefits for improving sleep quality and overall sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which types of yoga classes are best for sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all yoga classes are mellow. Some classes are more fast-paced, like power yoga for example, and can increase your heart rate. That's a good thing, but you want to focus on movement that does the opposite if you're feeling stressed and want to unwind before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I recommend doing calming, slow practices like yin yoga and restorative yoga," Kernaghan says. "In these classes, you'll generally stay in poses longer, use more props for support and have less intense instruction from the teacher, so there's more quiet space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the thought of doing anything that resembles a workout or requires a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/best-yoga-mat/" target="_self"&gt;yoga mat&lt;/a&gt; makes you cringe, you can also try yoga nidra, which Kernaghan recommends doing before bed. "Yoga nidra is "closer to meditation but is generally done lying down. Little to no physical effort is needed. Instead, a nidra practice helps drop you from a beta state (the waking state) to a theta state (occurs when you are dreaming, deeply relaxed or meditating)," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/landing1/best-mattress-sem-2024/" target="_self"&gt;Best Mattresses of 2025: Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed by our Sleep Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 best yoga poses for sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you struggle to fall asleep or catch quality Zs, try these poses in the evening to help you unwind. You can do them all in a sequence if you'd like, or pick and choose a few that feel good to you in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can definitely do poses on your own; sequences are nice because you have someone to guide you through, but if you're familiar with the postures, doing a few right before bed could be your perfect recipe," Kernaghan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supported Child's Pose&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Forward folds are calming for the body and with the fold at the knees and hips, this can also be a nice stretch for the hips and low back. definitely make sure your head is supported, so if you need to, add another pillow to make it comfortable," Kernaghan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do it, according to Kernaghan:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with your hands and knees touching the floor or bed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring your knees about as wide as a yoga mat, big toes touch behind you and sit your hips back to your heels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a thick pillow or couch cushion lengthwise, placed between the legs for the torso to stretch forward on, which should act like gentle support from the low belly to the head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feel free to turn your neck to one side and breathe. Stay for three to five minutes, turning your head halfway through if your neck is turned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supported Goddess Pose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gentle hip-opener is a perfect way to unwind and relax. Having a deep fold in the legs can help with digestion, and letting the body settle heavy to the floor is a great way to release any lingering holds from your day," Kernaghan says. (The above video shows a related exercise, not the one described here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do it, according to Kernaghan:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Come to a seated position with your legs out in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring the soles of your feet together, with your knees butterflied open, and use two pillows (one under each thigh/knee) as support. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recline the torso back onto the floor; feel free to use a folded blanket underneath the back of the head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place hands on the belly or open the arms out to the side. Cover the eyes if you'd like, and stay for three to five minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Legs Up the Wall&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This pose is amazing for so much, but in relation to sleep, it's great because it's a gentle inversion. The legs drain for a few minutes, which helps with circulation so the body is less agitated as you fall asleep. I love doing this pose in my bed sometimes, just swinging my legs up my headboard," Kernaghan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do it, according to Kernaghan:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This pose is just as it sounds. You sit close to a wall, bring your torso to the floor and swing your legs up the wall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recommend bringing your seat close to the wall, but if the legs or lower back are tight, keep some bend in the knees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like adding a pillow under my hips so my pelvis is slightly higher than my heart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay for three to five minutes. If your legs feel tingly, you can always bend and butterfly your knees open with your feet together instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these three yoga poses for sleep in your nighttime tool kit, you will be on your way to sweet dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other yoga poses for sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These poses are for any level of experience and are easy enough for beginners. While moving between these poses, remember to pay attention to your breath and where you feel most tension in your body. Breathe and try to relax if you experience any discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/best-yoga-mat/" target="_self"&gt;Best Yoga Mats for 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Cat-cow pose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get into this pose, start on your hands and knees. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart, and your knees should be below your hips. Take a deep breath and tilt your head toward the ceiling while also sticking up your pelvis, which should mimic a "cow." Then, on your exhale, arch your back and bring both your head and pelvis down like a "cat." You can repeat these two motions a few times before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Forward fold&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pose is as easy as standing up straight and leaning over to reach for your toes. If you are able, place your hands on the ground. If you are unable to touch your toes, you can do a half-forward fold and grab below your knees. Looking for a challenge? Try reaching around your ankles and holding on. Make sure your back is straight and you are taking deep breaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Bridge pose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by lying down on your back, legs and arms stretched out and on the ground. Take a deep breath, raise your core off the ground and shift your arms closer to your body to balance. Your knees should be at a 90-degree angle. Your hands can lie flat, or you can bring them together underneath your core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Happy baby&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an easy pose to transition into after Bridge, since you start this pose on your back. Lift your legs to the ceiling and out a little past your shoulders (or however far you can go). Then, grab onto the outside of your feet with both hands. Gently rock left and right to relieve tension in your lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Seated twist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recommend trying this after coming out of Child's pose. Simply sit back up and extend your legs out in front of you. Cross one leg over the other, pulling the heel of the crossed leg to your outer thigh. With the opposite arm, cross your body and twist yourself, pushing with your elbow on the raised knee. Twist and breathe. Repeat with the other side before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Butterfly pose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a seated position, straighten your posture and press the bottom of both your feet together. Placing your hands on your feet, attempt to press your hips as low as you can to the ground. The lower you go, the bigger the stretch. If you are looking for more of a challenge, move your feet closer to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Head-to-knee pose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a basic pose. Start in a seated position with your legs out in front of you. Bring one foot to the inner thigh of your opposite leg and extend your hands out over your extended leg. Sit up taller, breathe deeply and grab ahold of your foot in front of you. If you can't fully reach your foot, no problem: Grab your ankle or the back of your knee. Lean into the stretch and try to bring your forehead to your knee. Repeat on the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still want more?

            On a recent weekday evening, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashly-richards-1610aa44/" target="_blank"&gt;Ashly Richards&lt;/a&gt; helped her 13-year-old son, Case, with homework. He did math problems and some reading, underscoring how much he’s accomplished at his school for children with autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00033b6njn0bks0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Richards has heard Trump administration officials suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNeIZkacWkk" target="_blank"&gt;food dyes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZofNzZ8UoPk" target="_blank"&gt;pediatric vaccines&lt;/a&gt; cause autism and ADHD. That stance, she said, unfairly blames parents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00043b6nls9dynai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s no evidence to support it,” said Richards, 44, a marketing director in Richmond, Virginia. “As a parent, it’s infuriating.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00053b6n5mfe1sgj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In their zeal to “Make America Healthy Again,” Trump administration officials are making statements that some advocacy and medical groups say depict patients and the doctors who treat them as partly responsible for whatever ails them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00063b6n8c6ob6aa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and agency leaders have attributed a panoply of chronic diseases and other medical issues — such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, diabetes, and obesity — to consumers and their lifestyle choices, according to a review of 15 hours of recorded interviews, social media statements, and federal reports.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00073b6nv6cshst0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said at a news conference on April 16 that &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/apr/24/RFK-jr-environmental-toxins-causing-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;autism is preventable&lt;/a&gt; and that rates are rising because of toxic substances in the environment, despite a lack of evidence there is any link.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “These are kids who will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date,” he said. “Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00093b6nrv96s90x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of people on the spectrum do not have those severe challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000a3b6n8w81p8bt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The statements are more than rhetoric. These attitudes, ranging from judgments about individual behaviors to criticism of the chronically poor, are shaping policies that affect millions of people. The sentiments have been a factor behind decisions to cut Medicaid, keep federal insurance programs from covering anti-obesity drugs, and impose new barriers to covid vaccines for healthy people, say public health leaders and doctors. GOP lawmakers and federal health officials, they say, hold a reproachful stance toward chronic illnesses and the estimated 129 million people in the U.S. affected by them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000b3b6n70hqonjt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is at the heart of so much of our national problem with health,” said Robert Califf, who led the Food and Drug Administration during the Obama and Biden administrations. “It’s these two extreme views. It’s every health decision is up to the ‘rugged individual,’ versus the other extreme view that it’s all controlled by environment and social determinants of health. The truth is, it’s on a continuum.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000f3b6ni01ltnnr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Self-reliance is a common theme among adherents of MAHA, an informal movement for which Kennedy has fashioned himself the figurehead that promotes medical freedom, skepticism of vaccines, and a focus on nontraditional medicine to treat disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Taking medication to manage diabetes? FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested on &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-f-kennedy-jrs-fda-commissioner-marty-makarty-suggests-diabetics-get-cooking-classes-over-insulin/" target="_blank"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in late May that it would be effective to “treat more diabetes with cooking classes” instead of “just throwing insulin at people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000h3b6nk3xgbjsa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their pancreases don’t produce it, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/insulin-medicines-treatments#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20type%201,another%20option%20for%20some%20people." target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, which also notes that many with Type 2 diabetes “need to take diabetes medicines as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Taking birth control pills? Casey Means, President Donald Trump’s nominee to be U.S. surgeon general, has said that’s a “disrespect of life” for short-term gain and efficiency.

            “We are prescribing them like candy,” she said last year on “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUH4Co2wE-I" target="_blank"&gt;The Tucker Carlson Show&lt;/a&gt;,” adding that birth control medications “are literally shutting down the hormones in the female body that create this cyclical, life-giving nature of women.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000k3b6nwa0ev23x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Have a child on ADHD meds? &lt;a href="https://calleymeans.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Calley Means&lt;/a&gt;, who is an adviser to Kennedy and is Casey Means’ brother, said on the same show that Adderall is prescribed as the standard of care when children get a little fidgety because they’re in sedentary environments with limited sunlight and eat too much ultraprocessed food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000l3b6njh09vofz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a society, he said, “we’re really committing mass child abuse in many ways, and we’re normalizing that and we’re not speaking out about that. And then we’re giving people stimulants developed by Nazi Germany.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000m3b6nsm6zwmpd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Calley Means was probably referring to Pervitin, a &lt;a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/the-nazi-death-machine-hitler-s-drugged-soldiers-a-354606.html" target="_blank"&gt;methamphetamine-based&lt;/a&gt; drug administered to Adolf Hitler’s forces in World War II. Adderall is a prescription drug containing amphetamine, a stimulant that’s &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/how-do-adderall-and-meth-methamphetamine-differ#differences" target="_blank"&gt;not the same&lt;/a&gt; as methamphetamine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Department of Health and Human Services didn’t respond to messages seeking comment from Means.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Some conservatives and MAHA adherents argue that people need to take more responsibility for their health. But comments that shift blame to patients and physicians risk perpetuating stigmas, fostering the spread of misinformation, and eroding trust in modern medicine, say medical groups, doctors, and patient advocacy groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000p3b6ntec5vz0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The statements assume consumers and patients have control over improving their health and preventing chronic disease when the reality is more complex, according to some public health leaders. Lower-income people, they say, often lack access to grocery stores and healthy food, may juggle too many jobs to have time to cook from scratch, and may live in dangerous areas where it’s harder to get outside and exercise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000q3b6nrcc9g1er@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://events.uschamberfoundation.org/surgeongeneral/680209" target="_blank"&gt;Jerome Adams&lt;/a&gt;, surgeon general during the previous Trump administration, told KFF Health News that he worries efforts to promote health will be undone by “the return of vaccine-preventable diseases, increasing mistrust in the health care system, and the tearing down of social supports which are critical for making healthy choices.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000s3b6nl4lldzg4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The attitudes held by top Trump health officials have affected policy decisions, some doctors and public health leaders say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000t3b6ndes36vhp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy and other Trump administration health leaders have been especially outspoken, targeting issues they consider especially egregious in recent federal actions, research, or policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000u3b6ndk9ghk0j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, the Biden administration proposed &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-medicare-advantage-and-medicare-part-d-prescription-drug" target="_blank"&gt;a rule&lt;/a&gt; in November that would let Medicare cover weight loss medications such as Wegovy and Zepbound. But Kennedy and other political appointees at HHS and its agencies have criticized the drugs and the people who take them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000v3b6nory73jyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it’s very dark,” Calley Means &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUH4Co2wE-I" target="_blank"&gt;told Carlson&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the weight loss drugs. “I think it’s a stranglehold on the U.S. population, almost like solidifying this idea that there is a magic pill.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000w3b6njy709twg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He added: “Where is the urgency on saying ‘Hey parents, maybe we shouldn’t feed our kids toxic food?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000x3b6nn0hn2s1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, too, has criticized the medications and people who use them, saying in October on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertfkennedyjr/reel/DBWPFf4PmFV/" target="_blank"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; that drugmakers “are counting on selling it to Americans because we’re so stupid and so addicted to drugs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000y3b6nt65rymnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, the Trump administration announced it would not finalize the Biden-era coverage rule.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm000z3b6nt41d9x81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s impacting the kind of care and treatments patients will have,” said Andrea Love, a biomedical scientist and founder of ImmunoLogic, a science communication organization. “It sends the message that it’s your fault. It’s very much victim-blaming. It creates the idea that scientific progress is the devil, demonizes things that aren’t individually harming health, while avoiding addressing systemic issues that play a much larger role in health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00103b6nsktwd1r8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy and HHS didn’t return messages seeking comment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00113b6nz7clvrln@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data shows that the medications are effective. People who took the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/zepbound-explained-glp-1-weight-loss-drug-fda-approval#:~:text=The%20FDA%20approval%20of%20Zepbound,25%25%20of%20their%20body%20weight." target="_blank"&gt;highest dose of Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; in clinical trials lost an average of 48 pounds, and 1 in 3 on that dose lost more than 58 pounds, or 25% of their body weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00123b6nngdx3ddg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy and other agency leaders also oppose many covid-era health restrictions and rules. Some physicians and public health leaders note these officials downplayed covid risks while criticizing vaccines developed during the previous Trump administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00133b6n9obnr6si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has said that people who died from covid actually fell victim to chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, or asthma.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00143b6naznzxl67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s really what killed them,” Kennedy said on “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZofNzZ8UoPk" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Phil Primetime&lt;/a&gt;” in April. “These were people who were so sick they were basically hanging from a cliff, and covid came along and stamped on their fingers and dropped them off. But they were already living lives that were burdened by sickness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00153b6ncestru6s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Covid was the underlying cause of death for more than &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800816" target="_blank"&gt;940,000 people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. from Aug. 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, according to a 2023 report in JAMA Network, an open-access journal on biomedical sciences published by the American Medical Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00163b6n8k0n4ht6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Covid ranked first among deaths caused by infectious or respiratory diseases for youths under age 19, based on the report. Infants under a year old may be at higher risk of experiencing severe illness from covid compared with older children, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-in-babies-and-children/art-20484405" target="_blank"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;, and risks are also higher for infants under 6 months and those with underlying medical conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00173b6n2dvjcogt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/protecting-infants-and-children-from-covid-19-associated-hospitalization.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccination during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; can help protect infants after birth,” according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00183b6nkr2x8b6k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Kennedy announced in May that the federal government would no longer recommend covid vaccines for pregnant people and children who are healthy. Medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics opposed this decision and filed a lawsuit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm00193b6nevscznn9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also helped promote beliefs that many childless adults on Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people, don’t work and thereby drain resources from the program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm001a3b6nvtkh34qv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At a May hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Kennedy said the program was in jeopardy because of “all the able-bodied people who are not working [or] looking for jobs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm001b3b6n67obeuu6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a view embraced by Republican lawmakers who portrayed adults enrolled in Medicaid as lazy or shirking work as they advanced a budget bill estimated to cut federal spending on the program by about $1 trillion over a decade, in part by imposing work requirements on many adult beneficiaries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm001c3b6nbbyzl7xo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Thirty-five-year-olds sitting at home playing video games, they’re going to now have to go get a job,” said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm001d3b6nxevf1nll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The legislation, which Trump signed into law this month, will cause about 10 million more people to be without health insurance by 2034, &lt;a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61569" target="_blank"&gt;the Congressional Budget Office estimates&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm001e3b6nihvsatzi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some health leaders who criticized the legislation say the statements inaccurately maligned Medicaid enrollees, who by law cannot hold high-paying jobs and remain in the program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm001f3b6nbdnu38sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nonetheless, nearly two-thirds of adults ages 19 to 64 covered by Medicaid in 2023 were working. For about 3 in 10, caregiving responsibilities, an illness or disability, or school attendance prevented them from working, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work-an-update/" target="_blank"&gt;according to KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxi9ngm001g3b6n4zg1o7v2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s using anti-welfare tropes for something that is basic health care, not a cash benefit,” said Anthony Wright, executive director at Families USA, which supports the Affordable Care Act and expanded health coverage. He summarized the Republican message: “We’re going to make it harder to get the help you need by imposing a bunch of paperwork, and if you don’t get it, it’s your fault.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, a team of international researchers published a &lt;a href="https://journals.iucr.org/m/issues/2016/04/00/jt5013/jt5013fig1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;structural biology study in &lt;em&gt;IUCrJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that decoded the &lt;strong&gt;atomic-level makeup&lt;/strong&gt; of protein crystals secreted by a little-known&lt;strong&gt; cockroach &lt;/strong&gt;species, &lt;em&gt;Diploptera punctata&lt;/em&gt;. These crystals—formed inside developing embryos—are so nutritionally dense that scientists have suggested they could one day serve as &lt;strong&gt;a potent compact food source&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Backed by molecular imaging, the study revealed that the crystals are complete, highly ordered structures made of &lt;strong&gt;proteins, sugars, and lipids&lt;/strong&gt;, and that they could offer &lt;strong&gt;more than three times the energy of buffalo milk&lt;/strong&gt; per gram. While this doesn’t mean we’ll be sipping on cockroach milkshakes anytime soon, the implications for food science, space travel, and survival nutrition are significant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Unique Cockroach and an Unusual Form of Nourishment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diploptera punctata&lt;/em&gt;, a cockroach native to Pacific regions, is one of the few insect species that &lt;strong&gt;gives birth to live young&lt;/strong&gt; rather than laying eggs. To support &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/70-million-year-old-dinosaur-embryo-discovered/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79654" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;embryo development&lt;/a&gt;, the mother produces a &lt;strong&gt;milk-like fluid&lt;/strong&gt; that crystallizes in the gut of her offspring. Each of these &lt;strong&gt;Lili-Mip protein crystals&lt;/strong&gt; contains all the essential &lt;strong&gt;amino acids&lt;/strong&gt;, along with fats and carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The crystals were imaged using &lt;strong&gt;X-ray diffraction&lt;/strong&gt;, which revealed a &lt;strong&gt;lipocalin fold&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;bound lipids&lt;/strong&gt;, and a tightly packed glycosylated structure that allows for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/longevity-to-live-117-years-eating-only-three-yogurts-a-day-research-confirms/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="86084" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;slow digestion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—a rare property among natural proteins. As co-author &lt;em&gt;Sanchari Banerjee&lt;/em&gt; noted, the crystals are &lt;strong&gt;“a complete food,”&lt;/strong&gt; offering not only macronutrients but also time-release nutritional delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Built for Slow Release and High Efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike many nutrient supplements that spike and fade quickly in the bloodstream, the cockroach milk crystals &lt;strong&gt;dissolve gradually&lt;/strong&gt;, offering a &lt;strong&gt;sustained release of energy&lt;/strong&gt;. This controlled release is a direct consequence of their molecular structure, which holds nutrients in tightly packed layers, releasing them only as enzymes slowly break the crystal down during digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to lead researcher &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subramanian Ramaswamy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the protein “is time-released food. If you need calorically high food, that is time released and complete—this is it.” This characteristic could make it especially useful in scenarios requiring &lt;strong&gt;compact, long-lasting nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;—such as in emergency rations, long-duration missions in space, or extreme environments.&lt;/p&gt;

Polarized microscopy reveals birefringent protein crystals enclosed inside the embryo midgut and an enlarged view of the extracted crystals (inset).

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;No Milking Machines—Just Molecular Biology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the catchy headlines, &lt;strong&gt;milking cockroaches is neither feasible nor efficient&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, it would take over &lt;strong&gt;1,000 cockroaches to produce just 100 grams&lt;/strong&gt; of the crystals. Instead, the researchers identified and sequenced the &lt;strong&gt;genes responsible for producing the Lili-Mip proteins&lt;/strong&gt;, and are now attempting to &lt;strong&gt;replicate them in microbial systems like yeast&lt;/strong&gt;. This would allow the proteins to be produced in large quantities without relying on the insects themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If successful, this could pave the way for a novel category of engineered superfoods, offering compact, customizable, and shelf-stable nutrition for specific needs. The biomanufacturing pathway would also enable &lt;strong&gt;precise control over composition&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing future versions to be optimized for different demographic or medical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Future Use Cases—But Not Your Next Protein Shake&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its nutritional value, cockroach milk is &lt;strong&gt;not suitable for general consumption&lt;/strong&gt;—at least not yet. For one, &lt;strong&gt;no clinical trials have tested its safety in humans&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s also the caloric density: a hypothetical 250 ml serving of cockroach milk would pack around &lt;strong&gt;700 kilocalories&lt;/strong&gt;, making it a poor fit for calorie-conscious Western diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where it may shine, however, is in &lt;strong&gt;specialty applications&lt;/strong&gt;: nutritional therapy for malnourished populations, &lt;strong&gt;space food&lt;/strong&gt; for astronauts, or &lt;strong&gt;emergency packs&lt;/strong&gt; where space and stability matter more than flavor. The crystals are &lt;strong&gt;highly stable&lt;/strong&gt;, do not require refrigeration, and contain a nearly perfect nutrient profile—qualities hard to match with conventional food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And for those wondering about taste? According to a few researchers who handled the crystals, they are reported to have &lt;strong&gt;no discernible flavor&lt;/strong&gt;—a small relief in an otherwise alien-sounding food source.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="430" data-end="542"&gt;We notice “age” first in the mirror: a little dullness, a hint of puffiness, a posture that tells on our energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="544" data-end="601"&gt;The good news? A month is plenty of time to look fresher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="603" data-end="744"&gt;Not with miracle serums or hacks—but with simple, repeatable habits that change how your skin, muscles, and nervous system behave day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="746" data-end="833"&gt;I come at this like I came at my years as a financial analyst: small deposits compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="835" data-end="927"&gt;Do a few high-leverage things every day and you’ll see the difference faster than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="929" data-end="1062"&gt;Let’s get into the six habits I’ve tested, loved, and coached others to use—no fluff, just what actually moves the needle in 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1069" data-end="1116"&gt;1. Protect your skin from the sun, every day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1118" data-end="1188"&gt;What if the most effective “anti-aging” step takes less than a minute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1190" data-end="1207"&gt;That’s sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1209" data-end="1317"&gt;I put broad-spectrum SPF 30+ on my face, neck, chest, and the backs of my hands every morning—rain or shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1319" data-end="1388"&gt;On trail runs, I add a hat and sunglasses, and I reapply after sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1390" data-end="1448"&gt;Dermatologists have been saying this forever for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1450" data-end="1656"&gt;As the &lt;a class="cursor-pointer" href="https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/skin-care-secrets/anti-aging/reduce-premature-aging-skin" target="_new" rel="noopener" data-start="1457" data-end="1589"&gt;American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; notes, “The sun plays a major role in prematurely aging our skin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1658" data-end="1699"&gt;Here’s the routine that makes this stick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="1701" data-end="1972"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="1701" data-end="1781"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1703" data-end="1781"&gt;Keep your sunscreen where you’ll use it: by your toothbrush or coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="1782" data-end="1863"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1784" data-end="1863"&gt;Cover face, ears, neck, chest, and hands. Don’t forget the lip balm with SPF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="1864" data-end="1972"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1866" data-end="1972"&gt;Add shade and clothing when the sun is highest. Light layers and a wide-brim hat beat squinting and spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1974" data-end="2158"&gt;If you do only this one habit for 30 days, you’ll likely notice fewer new dark spots, less redness, and a more even tone—especially if you’re outdoors a lot (hello, gardening friends).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2160" data-end="2280"&gt;You’re not just preventing long-term damage; you’re dialing down the tiny daily inflammations that make skin look tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2287" data-end="2328"&gt;2. Prioritize sleep like it’s skincare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2330" data-end="2403"&gt;Have you ever stared at your face after a short night and thought, “Oof”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2405" data-end="2410"&gt;Same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2412" data-end="2509"&gt;Sleep is when your skin repairs, your lymphatic system clears waste, and your hormones rebalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2511" data-end="2530"&gt;It’s free skincare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2532" data-end="2748"&gt;As sleep scientist &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_walker_sleep_is_your_superpower"&gt;Matt Walker&lt;/a&gt; puts it, “Sleep is your life-support system and Mother Nature’s best effort yet at immortality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2750" data-end="2772"&gt;For 30 days, try this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="2774" data-end="3166"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2774" data-end="2874"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2776" data-end="2874"&gt;Fixed sleep window. Pick an eight-hour window you can keep most nights (for me, 11 p.m.–7 a.m.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2875" data-end="2967"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2877" data-end="2967"&gt;Dark + cool. Blackout shades if you can; cooler room; screens off 60 minutes before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2968" data-end="3055"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2970" data-end="3055"&gt;Front-load caffeine. Cut it after lunch. Your skin will thank you tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3056" data-end="3166"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3058" data-end="3166"&gt;Tiny wind-down. I do a “lights low, stretch slow” routine: 5 minutes of gentle neck, chest, and hip openers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3168" data-end="3195"&gt;What changes show up first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3197" data-end="3213"&gt;Puffiness fades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3215" data-end="3248"&gt;The whites of your eyes brighten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3250" data-end="3282"&gt;Your skin holds moisture better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3284" data-end="3349"&gt;Your baseline mood improves, which your face can’t help but show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3351" data-end="3418"&gt;Thirty days of good sleep is a visible facelift—without the knives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3425" data-end="3483"&gt;3. Strength-train (and fix your posture) in micro-doses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3485" data-end="3579"&gt;Nothing says “young and vibrant” like an upright, open posture and a bit of muscle definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3581" data-end="3682"&gt;Muscle supports joints, lifts your frame, and gives you that resilient look clothes are designed for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3684" data-end="3713"&gt;You don’t need gym marathons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3715" data-end="3808"&gt;Think minimum effective dose: two short strength sessions a week plus daily posture “snacks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3810" data-end="3987"&gt;As the &lt;a class="" href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_new" rel="noopener" data-start="3817" data-end="3891"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; puts it, “In addition, adults need at least 2 days of muscle-strengthening activity each week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3989" data-end="4017"&gt;Here’s a simple 30-day plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4019" data-end="4222"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4019" data-end="4051"&gt;Two 20-minute sessions/week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="4051" data-end="4054"&gt;Circuit of squats or chair sits, pushups (wall or floor), hip hinges (good mornings), rows (band or backpack), and a plank.&lt;br data-start="4177" data-end="4180"&gt;One minute on, 30 seconds off, two rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4224" data-end="4436"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4224" data-end="4257"&gt;Daily 3-minute posture reset:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="4257" data-end="4260"&gt;Stand tall, soften your knees, lengthen the back of your neck (imagine a string lifting your crown), sweep your arms up and back, then down.&lt;br data-start="4400" data-end="4403"&gt;Finish with two slow wall angels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4438" data-end="4448"&gt;That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4450" data-end="4560"&gt;On market mornings when I’m volunteering, I notice I carry crates differently—shoulders stacked, core engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4562" data-end="4698"&gt;Strength training doesn’t just change the mirror; it changes how you move through the day, which is exactly what people read as “young.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4705" data-end="4743"&gt;4. Eat color and hydrate on purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4745" data-end="4785"&gt;Want a clearer, brighter face by day 30?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4787" data-end="4816"&gt;Build it from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4818" data-end="5034"&gt;I make half my plate colorful plants at lunch and dinner—berries, leafy greens, tomatoes, peppers, carrots—and add a smart fat (walnuts, avocado, extra-virgin olive oil) plus a protein (beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5036" data-end="5142"&gt;Vitamin C helps collagen formation; polyphenols calm inflammation; omega-3s act like internal moisturizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5144" data-end="5163"&gt;A few simple rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5165" data-end="5487"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5165" data-end="5265"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5167" data-end="5265"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5167" data-end="5183"&gt;Color audit:&lt;/strong&gt; If your plate is mostly beige, add two colors you can see from across the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5266" data-end="5385"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5268" data-end="5385"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5268" data-end="5287"&gt;Protein anchor:&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for a palm-sized portion of plant protein each meal for steady energy and collagen support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5386" data-end="5487"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5388" data-end="5487"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5388" data-end="5408"&gt;Hydration habit:&lt;/strong&gt; A large glass of water before each meal. Herbal or green tea in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5489" data-end="5572"&gt;(I carry a bottle on trail runs; post-run, my skin doesn’t get that crumpled look.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5574" data-end="5687"&gt;If sugar is your kryptonite, try this swap for 30 days: fruit + nuts after meals instead of sweets between meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5689" data-end="5742"&gt;Your skin tone stabilizes when your blood sugar does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5744" data-end="5875"&gt;Personal note: when I started gardening more, I noticed my cravings shifted—cherry tomatoes straight off the vine taste like candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5877" data-end="5912"&gt;The side effect no one talks about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5914" data-end="6041"&gt;When you eat more plants, you naturally squint less (fewer sugar highs and crashes), which softens those 11s between the brows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6048" data-end="6119"&gt;5. De-puff daily: circulation, breath, and a two-minute face massage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6121" data-end="6152"&gt;“Puffy” often reads as “tired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6154" data-end="6229"&gt;Lymph moves when you move, and it’s sluggish when stress or salt stacks up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6231" data-end="6297"&gt;So I treat de-puffing like brushing my teeth—quick and consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6299" data-end="6337"&gt;My two-minute routine after cleansing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol data-start="6339" data-end="6700"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6339" data-end="6391"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6342" data-end="6391"&gt;Apply a few drops of facial oil or moisturizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6392" data-end="6520"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6395" data-end="6520"&gt;With light pressure, sweep from the center of the face out to the ears, then down the sides of the neck to the collarbones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6521" data-end="6609"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6524" data-end="6609"&gt;Tap gently under the eyes from the nose outward, then along the brow bones back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6610" data-end="6700"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6613" data-end="6700"&gt;Finish with three slow breaths: inhale through the nose, long exhale through the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6702" data-end="6788"&gt;Add a 10–15 minute walk after meals (I do this at the farmers’ market—built-in steps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6790" data-end="6898"&gt;Movement plus gentle massage reduces morning puffiness and gives you that “I slept” look even on off nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6900" data-end="7015"&gt;If salt is a thing for you, add a potassium-rich food daily—bananas, beans, or leafy greens—to help balance fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7017" data-end="7129"&gt;Bonus: swap your extra pillow for a slightly elevated head of bed or a thinner pillow that keeps your neck long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7131" data-end="7196"&gt;You’ll wake up less puffy around the eyes and with fewer creases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7203" data-end="7255"&gt;6. Downshift your stress (your face will show it)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7257" data-end="7361"&gt;Stress shows up on the face: clenched jaw, shallow breathing, tight lips, that furrow between the brows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7363" data-end="7481"&gt;You can’t avoid stress, but you can train your body to return to calm faster—and that changes your resting expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7483" data-end="7516"&gt;What helps in under five minutes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="7518" data-end="7985"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7518" data-end="7695"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7520" data-end="7695"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7520" data-end="7555"&gt;Physiological sigh (2 minutes):&lt;/strong&gt; Inhale through the nose, then a second short sip of air, slow exhale through the mouth. Repeat 6–8 times. Jaw unclenches; shoulders drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7696" data-end="7861"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7698" data-end="7861"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7698" data-end="7722"&gt;60-second “unphone”:&lt;/strong&gt; Put your phone down, look at a faraway point (out a window), and relax your eyes. Screens prompt micro-squints that etch into our faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7862" data-end="7985"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7864" data-end="7985"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7864" data-end="7882"&gt;Tiny joy hits:&lt;/strong&gt; A song you love, sunlight on your face, a text to a friend. Your nervous system reads these as safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7987" data-end="8060"&gt;I use a simple trigger: every time I wash my hands, I soften my forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8062" data-end="8086"&gt;It’s silly and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8088" data-end="8150"&gt;After 30 days of downshifting, your resting face looks kinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8152" data-end="8250"&gt;People will say you look “well-rested” and they won’t know it was mostly breath and less frowning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8257" data-end="8311"&gt;How to make these habits actually stick for 30 days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8313" data-end="8334"&gt;I promised practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8336" data-end="8359"&gt;Here’s the scaffolding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="8361" data-end="8911"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8361" data-end="8511"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8363" data-end="8511"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8363" data-end="8385"&gt;Pick your anchors.&lt;/strong&gt; Tie each habit to something you already do. Sunscreen after brushing teeth. Face massage after cleansing. Walk after lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8512" data-end="8637"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8514" data-end="8637"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8514" data-end="8534"&gt;Make it visible.&lt;/strong&gt; Put a sticky note on your mirror: SPF, sleep, strength, color, massage, breathe. Check it off daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8638" data-end="8764"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8640" data-end="8764"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8640" data-end="8672"&gt;Track the win, not the time.&lt;/strong&gt; One set of squats counts. A five-minute walk counts. Momentum matters more than duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8765" data-end="8911"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8767" data-end="8911"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8767" data-end="8790"&gt;Take a Day 1 photo.&lt;/strong&gt; Same light, same time of day. Take another on Day 15 and Day 30. You’ll see the micro-changes motivation can’t give you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8913" data-end="8960"&gt;If you slip, don’t start over—just start again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8962" data-end="9016"&gt;Younger-looking isn’t a finish line; it’s a direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="9023" data-end="9063"&gt;What this can look like in a real day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9065" data-end="9113"&gt;Here’s a sample day I’ve used when life is full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="9115" data-end="9655"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="9115" data-end="9235"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9117" data-end="9235"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="9117" data-end="9129"&gt;Morning:&lt;/strong&gt; SPF after brushing teeth. Two minutes of face massage if I’m puffy. Walk to get coffee, shoulders back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="9236" data-end="9347"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9238" data-end="9347"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="9238" data-end="9249"&gt;Midday:&lt;/strong&gt; Big colorful lunch bowl (greens + beans + something crunchy). Five-minute stroll or stair loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="9348" data-end="9474"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9350" data-end="9474"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="9350" data-end="9364"&gt;Afternoon:&lt;/strong&gt; Water before the 3 p.m. snack. If I’m dragging, I do three “physiological sighs” instead of another coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="9475" data-end="9602"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9477" data-end="9602"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="9477" data-end="9489"&gt;Evening:&lt;/strong&gt; Twenty-minute strength circuit while dinner roasts. Phone down one hour before bed, lights low, quick stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="9603" data-end="9655"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9605" data-end="9655"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="9605" data-end="9613"&gt;Bed:&lt;/strong&gt; Same time every night. Cool, dark, quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9657" data-end="9726"&gt;On trail days, I reapply sunscreen, wear a hat, and drink more water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9728" data-end="9788"&gt;On market days, my strength circuit might be just one round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9790" data-end="9803"&gt;Still counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="9810" data-end="9837"&gt;What to expect by Day 30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="9839" data-end="10304"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="9839" data-end="9924"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9841" data-end="9924"&gt;More even tone, fewer new spots or redness because you protected your skin daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="9925" data-end="10022"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9927" data-end="10022"&gt;Less puffiness (especially under eyes) and a brighter look from better sleep and circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="10023" data-end="10127"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10025" data-end="10127"&gt;Uprighter posture and subtly stronger lines in your shoulders and legs from micro-doses of strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="10128" data-end="10215"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10130" data-end="10215"&gt;Softer resting expression thanks to less squinting and fewer jaw-clenching moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="10216" data-end="10304"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10218" data-end="10304"&gt;A calmer, steadier energy that shows up on your face before you feel it anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10306" data-end="10335"&gt;Will you erase every wrinkle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10337" data-end="10351"&gt;Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10353" data-end="10428"&gt;But will you look fresher, more open, and more like you after just a month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10430" data-end="10441"&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

That's a new case diagnosed roughly every 3.2 seconds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to the personal devastation that this diagnosis causes for affected individuals and their loved ones, ADI estimates that the global cost of dementia will rise to $2.8 trillion by 2030, a number that includes the cost of informal care by family and friends as well as direct medical costs. In the face of this daunting trajectory, one new study offers a glimmer of hope by suggesting that following an AI-designed diet may significantly lower one's risk of developing dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In early July, researchers from Shanghai, China, published the findings of their study on a machine learning optimized diet against dementia risk in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02255-w" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The studied aimed to identify dietary patterns that may delay the onset of dementia or slow structural and pathological changes in the brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team explains that while there has been work done in this field, "existing observational studies are often hampered by relatively small sample sizes, short-term follow-up, or both, especially considering the long preclinical phase of dementia." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To fill these research gaps, the scientists used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, which collected 24-hour dietary information from 185,012 participants and followed up with them after an average of 10 years to review who developed any type of dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They then undertook a "food-wide association analysis and identified food groups associated with incident dementia" out of this massive cohort. Based on this data, the researchers "ranked the importance of food groups in predicting dementia risk with a machine-learning approach and derived a new dietary pattern for dementia prevention." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, they compared the magnitude of this new dietary pattern's association with dementia to that of the &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/mind-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known diet that was developed in 2015 to promote healthy brain aging. In short, they investigated which one was likely more effective at preventing the disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Results revealed that a number of foods we already know to be nutritious are also linked to reduced risk of dementia. These ingredients include green leafy vegetables, citrus, and berries. Consuming grapefruit was found to be associated with a lower risk of dementia compared to not eating grapefruit at all, and similar results were revealed for sweet peppers and tomatoes. Moderate intake of potatoes, eggs, olive oil, and poultry was recommended as well, with the study providing guidelines for how much of each one should eat per day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the opposite end of the spectrum, the machine-learning model and researchers found that some foods could increase the risk of dementia, such as sweetened beverages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following the revelation of connections between some foods and risk of dementia, the study created a suggested dietary pattern consisting of seven components, dubbed the "Machine learning-assisted Optimizing Dietary intERvention against demeNtia risk," or MODERN diet, built around three categories: adequacy, moderation, and restriction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Foods were then placed into a fitting category, which points to how much of that item one should be consuming. For example, olive oil was placed in the adequacy group, indicating that greater intake of it could reduce the risk of dementia. For the foods in the moderation category, the team suggested that people should aim to have neither too little nor too much of these ingredients, like leafy greens, berries, citrus, potatoes, eggs, and poultry. Unsurprisingly, the team put sweetened beverages in its "restriction" category, noting that people should not consume them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The MODERN diet aligns with the MIND diet on many important guidelines while providing some key updates to this recommended way of eating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "While green leafy vegetables and poultry were recommended for higher intake in the MIND diet, the MODERN diet recommended moderate intake," the team wrote in its discussion. "The MODERN diet also recommends moderate intake of fruits and added citrus fruits to berries in fruit choices, both of which are rich in plant polyphenols and may improve cognitive function by inhibiting oxidative stress in the brain and neurodegenerative pathologies." Citrus had not previously been recommended in the MIND diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A crucial clarification here is the word "moderate," as the researchers added that "extremely high intakes of these components potentially increased the risk of incident dementia… suggesting that a ‘balanced’ diet derived from hierarchical clustering was related to better cognitive functions." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One component of the older MIND diet was missing from this new research's suggested dietary pattern: fish. The authors explained that fish didn't appear to increase or decrease the risk of dementia in the cohort they studied. However, they pointed out that this could be because the cohort was made up of British people, and fish is "often fried in the United Kingdom," which may have impacted the results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a small trial across ten U.S. research sites, a novel HIV vaccine candidate has shown a result that has eluded scientists for four decades: it reliably produced potent, virus-blocking antibodies in most participants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work, published last week in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady6831"&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, tested three experimental vaccines built with the same mRNA technology used in COVID-19 shots but with a crucial twist. Instead of encoding HIV’s outer protein in its free-floating form, two of the vaccines instructed cells to make a “membrane-anchored” version, mimicking how the protein appears on the actual virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That one subtle change made a striking difference. After three doses, 80% of volunteers who received a membrane-bound version produced “tier 2” neutralizing antibodies. This is a benchmark that suggests good protection against the virus. Meanwhile, in the group that received the traditional soluble form, only 4% did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The difference is pretty striking,” Sharon Lewin, head of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, who was not involved in the research, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02439-4"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “These are the first studies, so they’re very, very important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-is-an-hiv-vaccine-so-hard-to-make"&gt;Why is an HIV vaccine so hard to make&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since its discovery in 1983, HIV has proven uniquely slippery. The virus wears a dense coat of sugars, shielding key targets from antibodies, and mutates so rapidly that even an &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/measles-doesnt-just-make-you-sick-it-resets-your-immune-system/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2558"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; that manages to block one strain is often powerless against the next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, most vaccine candidates have targeted the “envelope trimer”—a three-pronged protein that HIV uses to latch onto immune cells. In reality, much of the trimer’s base is hidden against the viral membrane. Soluble protein vaccines, however, expose that base. This, in turn, prompts the body to make antibodies that bind there. But these antibodies can’t stop the actual infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new approach, developed by William Schief and colleagues at Scripps Research and Moderna, anchors the protein to cell membranes. That way, the immune system learns to recognize more vulnerable, real-world parts of the virus and can effectively eliminate the virus&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over 100 HIV vaccine trials have been undertaken over the years. But this one seemed particularly promising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/animal-cruelty-free-testing-methods-will-tested-u-s-food-drug-administration/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2560"&gt;Animal tests&lt;/a&gt; hinted that such vaccines might work better. The new trial, involving humans, confirmed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-the-trial-found"&gt;What the Trial Found&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study enrolled 108 healthy adults aged 18 to 55. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three vaccines: the soluble trimer, a membrane-bound trimer, or a membrane-bound version with a mutation to block CD4 receptor binding. Each group received either a low (100 μg) or high (250 μg) dose, three times over six months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tests on volunteers’ blood showed that the membrane-bound vaccines spurred a stronger immune reaction than the traditional approach. They also seemed to “train” the immune system to focus less on parts of the virus that don’t help much in stopping infection, and more on its weak spots—regions known as V1/V3 and C3/V5—that are more likely to block HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These vaccines also built up a stockpile of memory B cells, which act like long-term sentries, and activated specialized T cells, which help coordinate the body’s entire immune defense. The entire body’s immune system mobilized for the task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there were limits. The antibodies produced were “autologous.” They recognized the particular virus strain the vaccine had, but not the many other HIV strains circulating worldwide. The ultimate goal is to elicit &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/vaccine-hiv-passes-phase-one-trial-23637533/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2557"&gt;broadly neutralizing antibodies&lt;/a&gt; (bnAbs), which can target conserved sites across diverse strains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The side effects were significant, but not truly threatening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seven participants — about 6.5 percent — developed hives, or urticaria, after vaccination. In five cases, the condition became chronic, lasting more than six weeks; in some, symptoms persisted for years. The reaction occurred across all three vaccine types, at both doses, and has not been seen in &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/finally-mrna-vaccines-against-cancer-are-starting-to-become-a-reality/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2559"&gt;mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; against other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a scientific mystery at the moment,” Schief told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2490444-human-trials-point-the-way-towards-an-mrna-vaccine-against-hiv/"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers suspect that something about the combination of HIV proteins and the mRNA delivery platform triggers the effect, but they have yet to pinpoint the cause. Future trials will test lower doses in hopes of reducing the risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-we-actually-make-an-hiv-vaccine"&gt;Can we actually make an HIV vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite all the unknown variables, the study is a milestone. Only two other mRNA HIV vaccine trials have ever reached human testing, and none until now have shown such a high rate of neutralizing antibody production. It’s truly promising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say the technology’s speed and flexibility brought by mRNA (which allows new designs built in just months) can accelerate the long, trial-and-error process of training the immune system to fight HIV. In the future, scientists could program a single mRNA shot to release a full sequence of priming and boosting proteins in timed waves, replacing months or even years of repeated clinic visits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it’s far from a solved problem. First, studies with a greater sample size need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Then, researchers need to find a way to make the vaccine effective against multiple strains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s a worthy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the best current HIV prevention tools, such as the twice-yearly injectable drug lenacapavir, require ongoing use and access to healthcare. A durable, widely protective vaccine would be transformative, especially in low-resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;

Good news if you’re not someone who has been able to reach that goal easily — a new &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00164-1/fulltext"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet Public Health&lt;/em&gt; medical journal says just 7,000 steps a day might be enough to cause noticeable improvements in health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted by researchers from Australia, Spain and the UK, reviewed past papers for correlation between levels of exercise and risk factors of various ailments such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, depressive symptoms and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a baseline of 2,000 steps, which is something most adults manage even without taking extra time to exercise, the study compared the reduction in rates of disease incidence. The findings indicate that those who walk 7,000 steps are 47 per cent less likely to die of cardiovascular disease and 37pc less likely to die of cancer. The same group has a 25pc lesser chance of developing cardiovascular disease in the first place and a 14pc lower risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to this, those who completed their 10,000 steps were only marginally less likely to develop these diseases, the differences being in single digits. The study even found that the more active group was very slightly more prone to dying from cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the mental health front, the study found those who exercise had a 38pc lower chance of exhibiting depressive symptoms and a 22pc less chance of developing dementia. They also found that the 7,000-step group had better balance and coordination, being 28pc less likely to suffer falls; this number went down for those walking over 10,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 2019 &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2734709#google_vignette"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Japanese and US researchers found a similar peak benefit point at 7,500 steps; the same paper said walking backwards was more beneficial for cognitive ability and coordination. A 2011 &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289267640_Backward_walking_A_possible_active_exercise_for_low_back_pain_reduction_and_enhanced_function_in_athletes"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Nevada backed up the correlation between brain health and backward retro walking; it also said walking backwards strengthens hamstrings and reduces pain in the lower back.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
