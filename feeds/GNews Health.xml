That’s why, at some point, you may need to power up your workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="TOD7TLGENVFWVM5JY5JNDM672Y" data-contentid="TOD7TLGENVFWVM5JY5JNDM672Y" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;It’s important to “find ways to challenge yourself again,” said Chris Jordan, an exercise physiologist and the creator of the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;original, science-based 7-minute workout&lt;/a&gt;. Our bodies adapt to the demands of our current workouts, he continued, adding more heart and lung capacity and other changes that make the same workout you’ve been doing for months feel progressively easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="PJLV PJLV-igWRsMW-css"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ZRYOLSDLRFBB3K2GBO4DTDN3XM" data-contentid="ZRYOLSDLRFBB3K2GBO4DTDN3XM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;This process, known as exercise adaptation, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-020-0377-1?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;makes us more athletic and fit&lt;/a&gt;. But, even more important, it can “contribute toward the delayed onset of age-related disease,” according to a comprehensive 2018 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5983157/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of how regular exercise benefits our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV ad--enterprise"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-ikOErwM-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md flex"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="OZGSLJEMZ5CYHESZJXSN7GYA7E" data-contentid="OZGSLJEMZ5CYHESZJXSN7GYA7E" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;To help increase your fitness, Jordan developed the 7-Minute Power Workout for The Washington Post. It builds on the scientific principles he used in the original 7-minute workout — featuring 12 movements that increase strength, power and endurance. The exercises focus alternately on the upper and lower body and are meant to be completed at a relatively high intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div target="_blank" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-hHnAni-type-inline wpds-c-PJLV-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-ciKXky wpds-c-ciKXky-hNRVRD-type-inline"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-bmgAQv"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Save this story to do the workout again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="DHL4PHAGCRFHZF4KBPMXFFBYJU" data-contentid="DHL4PHAGCRFHZF4KBPMXFFBYJU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;That means your effort should feel like an eight on a scale from zero to 10, Jordan said. Or, more informally, you should be able to speak a few words before pausing for breath, he said, but you shouldn’t be able to sing during the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ES5PBWA2WNCYBALJJUXNDRCMOM" data-contentid="ES5PBWA2WNCYBALJJUXNDRCMOM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Since the exercises in the new workout are more complex than before, involving a greater range of muscles and coordination, it’s fine to start deliberately and dial in the proper form, Jordan said. Then gradually speed up until you’re pushing yourself during each move for the full seven minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="VSUHTFVRA5E7XIGJMRU52OWJLQ" data-contentid="VSUHTFVRA5E7XIGJMRU52OWJLQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;As always, consider talking with your doctor before trying a new exercise routine. Warm up with a few stretches, jumping jacks or high knees. Then complete as many of each exercise as you can in 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="OLX2NOXZQVHFPKZB6U24AZNLK4" data-contentid="OLX2NOXZQVHFPKZB6U24AZNLK4" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;So, how can you tell if you’re ready for this power version?

			&lt;p&gt;One of the most consumed drugs in the US – and the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00316"&gt;most commonly taken analgesic worldwide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;– may do a lot more than simply take the edge off your headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&lt;span&gt;cetaminophen, also known as paracetamol and sold widely under the brand names Tylenol and Panadol, may also increase risk-taking, according to a study from 2020 that measured changes in people's behavior when under the influence of the common over-the-counter medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Acetaminophen seems to make people feel less negative emotion when they consider risky activities – they just don't feel as scared,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;neuroscientist Baldwin Way from The Ohio State University when the findings were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With nearly 25 percent of the population in the US taking acetaminophen each week, reduced risk perceptions and increased risk-taking could have important effects on society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that acetaminophen's effects on pain reduction also extend to various psychological processes, lowering people's&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797610374741"&gt;receptivity to hurt feelings&lt;/a&gt;, experiencing&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/9/1345/2224135"&gt;reduced empathy&lt;/a&gt;, and even&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tylenol-may-make-it-harder-for-users-to-spot-errors-says-study"&gt;blunting cognitive functions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147551" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule.jpg" alt="World's Most Common Pain Relief Drug May Induce Risky Behavior" class="wp-image-147551 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule-545x415.jpg 545w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule-600x457.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147551" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A 3D molecule of acetaminophen. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Paracetamol-from-xtal-3D-vdW.png"&gt;Ben Mills/Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;span&gt;n a similar way, the research suggests people's affective ability to perceive and evaluate risks may potentially be altered or impaired when they take acetaminophen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the effects might be slight – and should be considered hypothetical for now – they're worth noting, given acetaminophen is the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://liverfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Common-Medicines-with-Acetaminophen-Know-Your-Dose.pdf"&gt;most common drug ingredient in America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, found in over 600 different kinds of over-the-counter and prescription medicines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of experiments involving over 500 university students as participants, Way and his team measured how a single 1,000 mg dose of acetaminophen (the recommended maximum adult single dosage) randomly assigned to participants affected their risk-taking behavior, compared against placebos randomly given to a control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of the experiments, participants had to pump up an un-inflated balloon on a computer screen, with each single pump earning imaginary money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their instructions were to earn as much imaginary money as possible by pumping the balloon as much as possible, but to make sure not to pop the balloon, in which case they would lose the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the students who took acetaminophen engaged in significantly more risk-taking during the exercise, relative to the more cautious and conservative  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="156692" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; group. On the whole, those on acetaminophen pumped (and burst) their balloons more than the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147552" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay.jpg" alt="World's Most Common Pain Relief Drug May Induce Risky Behavior" class="wp-image-147552 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay-303x415.jpg 303w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay-600x821.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147552" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Baldwin Way, who led the research. (&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Ohio State News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're risk-averse, you may pump a few times and then decide to cash out because you don't want the balloon to burst and lose your money,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Way said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But for those who are on acetaminophen, as the balloon gets bigger, we believe they have less anxiety and less negative emotion about how big the balloon is getting and the possibility of it bursting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the balloon simulation, participants also filled out surveys during two of the experiments, rating the level of risk they perceived in various hypothetical scenarios, such as betting a day's income on a sporting event, bungee jumping off a tall bridge, or driving a car without a seatbelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the surveys, acetaminophen consumption did appear to reduce perceived risk compared to the control group, although in another similar survey, the same effect wasn't observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While an experiment like this doesn't necessarily reflect how acetaminophen might affect people in real-life scenarios, based on an average of results across the various tests, the team concluded that there is a significant relationship between taking acetaminophen and choosing more risk, even if the observed effect appears slight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the researchers acknowledged the drug's apparent effects on risk-taking behavior could also be interpreted via other kinds of psychological processes, such as reduced anxiety, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It may be that as the balloon increases in size, those on placebo feel increasing amounts of anxiety about a potential burst,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scan/nsaa108/5897711"&gt;the researchers explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When the anxiety becomes too much, they end the trial. Acetaminophen may reduce this anxiety, thus leading to greater risk taking."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring such psychological alternative explanations for this phenomenon – as well as investigating the biological mechanisms responsible for acetaminophen's effects on people's choices in situations like this – should be addressed in future research, the team said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential impact of acetaminophen's effect on people's risk perception, the drug nonetheless remains one of the most important and highly used medications in the world, considered an&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_Model_List_of_Essential_Medicines"&gt;essential medicine by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, even if other questions linger&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We really need more research on the effects of acetaminophen and other over-the-counter drugs on the choices and risks we take," &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Way said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsaa108"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A subsequent commentary published in 2021 highlighted some criticisms of the original study and its interpretation in the media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to better reflect the hypothetical nature of the study and its findings.

Plus, we looked at what the research says about eating the fruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephani-johnson-dcn-rdn-88856120/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephani Johnson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stephani Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, D.C.N., R.D.N., is an adjunct professor in the department of clinical and preventive nutrition sciences at &lt;a href="https://shp.rutgers.edu/?_gl=1%2Ai4adtj%2A_gcl_au%2AMTUyNTkyNDg3Mi4xNzQwNTA4MTQ2&amp;amp;_ga=2.151383929.1366124760.1742845226-227429285.1738870850" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rutgers University School of Health Professions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rutgers University School of Health Professions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelyn-arteche-rdn-a6854611/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Evelyn Arteche;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Evelyn Arteche&lt;/a&gt;, M.S., R.D.N., C.P.T., C.G.F.I. is at &lt;a href="https://www.cooperhealth.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cooper University Health Care;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cooper University Health Care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it bad to eat an apple every day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, no. “While apples contain fructose, a natural sugar in all fruits, they are a valuable part of a healthy diet,” says Stephani Johnson, D.C.N., R.D.N., adjunct professor in the department of clinical and preventive nutrition sciences at Rutgers University School of Health Professions. “Their nutrient density and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a33382312/fiber-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; content contribute to overall health, making them a beneficial choice for daily consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get more specific, medium apples typically have about 4.4 grams of fiber, which can help you to meet the daily recommended fiber intake of 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men. Apples also count as one of your five servings of fruits and vegetables, which should be a daily goal, says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since they do contain sugar, to minimize blood sugar spikes, control the portion size of apples and pair them with protein and healthy fats, such as nut butter, cheese, or yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the nutritional value of apples?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the breakdown for &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1750341/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one medium apple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one medium apple&lt;/a&gt; with skin, which is about three inches in diameter (roughly the size of a baseball or a small fist):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health benefits of apples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, Johnson and Evelyn Arteche, M.S., R.D.N., C.P.T., C.G.F.I., at Cooper University Health Care, break down some of the reasons to consider eating apples regularly. “It is important to note that you get more nutrition value from eating a whole apple with the skin,” Arteche says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoother digestion: &lt;/strong&gt;The fiber in apples can help promote bowel regularity. “Additionally, the pectin in apple skin serves as a prebiotic, supporting a healthy microbiome and overall gut health,” says Johnson. “Research indicates that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in various aspects of health, including mental well-being, disease risk, and immune function.” Studies explicitly examining the effects of apples on gut health are limited, but extensive research supports the beneficial impacts of fiber and pectin on gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight management: &lt;/strong&gt;“Apples can aid in weight management, particularly when consumed in place of higher-calorie, less healthy options,” says Johnson. Research specifically evaluating the effects of apple consumption on weight management in humans is limited. But, Johnson points to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26394033/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one 2015 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one 2015 study&lt;/a&gt; which found that higher fruit and vegetable intake, as well as increased intake of apples and pears, was inversely associated with weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-fiber foods with high water content, such as apples, promote satiety so you feel fuller longer than if you, say, ate a cookie. “Fiber slows down gastric emptying and induces a feeling of fullness lasting longer when compared to drinking juice, for example, which does not contain much fiber,” says Arteche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart health: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies have yielded mixed results specifically regarding apple consumption and heart health. “Despite these mixed findings, substantial research links diets rich in fruits and vegetables and low in processed foods to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension, as seen in those following the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a20455774/lower-blood-pressure-dash-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;,” says Johnson. “Increasing fruit and vegetable intake, including apples, may contribute to cardiovascular health by supporting gut microbiome balance, promoting weight management, and providing antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals implicated in cardiovascular disease risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential side effects of eating apples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diarrhea:&lt;/strong&gt; “Fiber in excess can cause diarrhea in some people,” says Arteche. “For example, people with conditions such as Crohn’s disease, diverticulitis, gastroparesis, ulcerative colitis, a new colostomy, or a new ileostomy may need to avoid apples, especially apples with skin on them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food allergies:&lt;/strong&gt; “People who are allergic to apricot, plum, almond, peach, pear, and strawberry can also be allergic to apples and should avoid them,” says Arteche.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood sugar elevation:&lt;/strong&gt; “Although apples are a healthy, low-calorie food, they are naturally high in sugar, which may contribute to blood sugar elevations, especially in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes,” says Johnson. “However, in comparison to other fruits, apples have a lower glycemic index, meaning that they do not spike blood sugar to the same extent as some other carbohydrate foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples generally are safe to eat daily unless you have a food allergy, or other medical reason to avoid them. (Always talk to your healthcare provider if you’re unsure whether a food is for you or not.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to their fiber and water content, apples promote digestive regularity and also may help you feel fuller longer, so they can play a role in weight management. They also contribute to your daily goal for both fiber and servings of fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9BTjRheEgwZ0JYaGZRLTRQZ2R1aE96VXlndl9VeVBXejdMXzVXaEhkYzhBbjFhenVXRlRJZjk5dDhGYnlsNWxmb1lOMDYzYnVGMDNTVmhhYjJwUGdlZm1GWFR5SnpaQW9lb3c</guid></item><item><title>Study links increasing sleepiness, higher dementia risk among older women - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxPU1pJY2cwaVdzY0ZXVXZDaUZGek9Od0tmVlR4QTM5X1VQWnJ1UGZvdTQ0T0lhdVp5Z19qQi02ek9PdGt3bDBWUExYcFFuNElLdHlwNEhuS1VOeHJkNzdCVjJyTDhOcEdCTmdqM2lDeXZ1MXE3RE5aOEgwTC02R29XelZWUFZyaEU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T4EQAL4R7JDMRBP3VDW5MYYZAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Women in their 80s who experience increasing sleepiness over time have double the risk of developing dementia than their counterparts with stable sleep patterns, a recent analysis suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2CORXJTQ3FD77FEUOHF6G7BCJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Published in Neurology, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213403" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; looked at data from 733 women without cognitive impairment who participated in a study that  ran  between 2002 and 2009. The women were a mean of 82.5 years old at the start of the study, and they used a wrist device that tracked their sleep and circadian rhythm patterns over three consecutive days once at the start of the study and again five years later. Patients filled out sleep logs and were given neuropsychological tests during the five-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QBTFE5LLTBHQ5C74TB4WB5I64A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On average, participants’ total sleep time increased by 18.7 minutes during the five-year follow-up period, and sleep efficiency — a score of sleep quality — increased by 0.94 percent on average. Napping rose over the study period, too, with participants’ napping duration increasing 33.1 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GDYZ36RAQVGBBM76CGDSQOYZTU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;About 44 percent of the women showed stable sleep patterns during the study. Another 34.9 percent were categorized as having declining nighttime sleep, with decreased nighttime sleep quality and slight increases in daytime napping. The final group, which made up 21.3 percent of the women, saw “large increases in daytime and nighttime sleep duration and quality,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U735HJJSSBHLPL3DYX5TPILDWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Overall, 93 of the women — 12.7 percent — developed dementia during the study period.

Among the best foods for fiber are raspberries, lentils and avocado, said Saphier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, she said she promotes gut motility (the coordinated muscular contractions that move food and waste through the gastrointestinal tract) with ginger, plus staying hydrated &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/fitness-and-wellbeing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:and exercising;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;and exercising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do all of that and your gut is going to be as healthy as can be," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the impact of stress on hair loss and gut health? The doctor said that stress isn't just a feeling; it's an actual physiological effect on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"Managing stress isn’t about eliminating it," she said.

They are, however, one of a few reasons you might consider &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/do-you-need-to-wash-rice-before-cooking-heres-the-science-71588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;washing your grains&lt;/a&gt; in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are rice weevils?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils are a natural part of the environment, and just like us, they love snacking. They do indeed, as their name suggests, love rice, but they are also known to feast on crops of things like corn and other grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/fossilized-insects-photonic-diamonds-reveal-the-evolution-of-structural-color-55717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;weevils&lt;/a&gt; they have a delightfully noodly snoot that they use to gnaw into the hard casing of rice grains. Not only do they feed on the good stuff inside, but females will also lay their eggs inside rice grains. This is how a rice weevil’s journey to your pantry begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="82965" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;What in the prison break do these rice weevil larva think they're playing at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: Tomasz Klejdysz / Shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do weevils get into rice?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial rice production involves a certain amount of fumigating to try and keep the stock clear of pests, but it’s rarely 100 percent effective. The adult weevils are tiny, but the larvae are even harder to catch because they travel as stowaways tucked safely inside the rice grain. According to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fjzjphH6CM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Deep Look&lt;/a&gt;, scientists have even tried using sound to track down infestations in rice stores by listening out for their chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They feed on the inside of the rice grain until it’s just an empty shell and then crawl out as adult weevils. Once out, they can start the process of laying their own eggs and this is how even just a couple of weevils can result in an infestation if rice isn’t stored properly and goes uneaten for several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fjzjphH6CM??si=CCyBvOPZMranhIP8&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing rice weevils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils are more common the closer you are to the source, as a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5923/j.ijaf.20140401.03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that raw milled rice contained the highest number of weevils. This number dropped off in more treated rice samples, such as that being imported and parboiled rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-storage treatment of rice contributes to the likelihood of a rice weevil infestation as well as the actual rice grains themselves, and the researchers suggest that heat sterilization can be effective in minimizing rice weevils. That said, that some weevils make it past fumigation and importation to the bags in some people’s pantries isn’t the end of the world, because eating a couple of weevils won’t hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="82966" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;Rice weevils won't hurt you, but if you leave your rice sitting around for months, they could destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: Aurius / Shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are rice weevils harmful?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils aren't always going to be in rice, and even if they were, eating a few won’t harm you. If anything, it’s just going to boost the protein content of your grains a bit, but you can sweep away rice weevils by &lt;a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-safety-tips/food-risk-concerns/risk-at-a-glance/rice-weevils#:~:text=Consumers%20can%20remove%20rice%20weevils,to%20consume%20the%20rice%20thereafter." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;washing your rice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where rice weevils can be harmful is in their hunger for dried goods, and if left to their own devices they’ll reduce your grains to a heap of creepy dust. This is why managing rice weevils is a bit matter of concern for large-scale producers who don’t want to lose their stock, but you the consumer with your modest bag of rice at home don’t need to worry. If you’d like to be extra careful, you can make sure to store your rice properly in an air-tight container somewhere cool and dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not want to be accidentally &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkKHRp9YO0o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;eating insects&lt;/a&gt;, but there is something to be said for making these terrestrial arthropods part of the menu.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As a measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico continues to grow, and other states report outbreaks of their own, some pediatricians across the U.S. say they are seeing a new trend among concerned parents: vaccine enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our call center was inundated with calls about the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine," says &lt;a href="https://pbpediatrics.com/staff/shannon-fox-levine/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Shannon Fox-Levine&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in Broward County, Fla. She says parents are asking if their child is up to date on their vaccinations. Or "should they get another vaccine? Should they get an extra one? Can they get it early?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/1239156786/measles-is-spreading-are-you-safe" target="_blank"&gt;spreads quickly in communities&lt;/a&gt; where vaccination rates are low, and vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise across the U.S. in recent years. Kindergarten &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates &lt;/a&gt;have not bounced back to their pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Fox-Levine says the recent interest in the MMR vaccine — which protects against measles, mumps and rubella — is a refreshing change in a state where vaccine hesitancy has been growing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Florida's kindergarten vaccination rates to protect against measles&lt;a href="https://www.wusf.org/health-news-florida/2025-01-13/fewer-florida-kids-getting-routine-vaccinations" target="_blank"&gt; fell to 88.1% in the 2023-2024 school year&lt;/a&gt; — below the 95% vaccination rate considered necessary to protect against outbreaks. So, seeing a demand for vaccines is "exciting," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Five U.S. states are currently experiencing measles outbreaks — New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, which has the most cases by far, with &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;400 confirmed cases as of Friday&lt;/a&gt;. So far this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. has reported more than 480 measles &lt;/a&gt;cases in 20 states. That's more cases than in all of 2024. Almost all of the cases are in people who were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Parents are watching what's happening with these outbreaks and concern about potential exposure is growing.  Before the measles vaccine was developed in the early 1960s, the disease &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt;used to kill hundreds of people &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S. every year.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In Southern Pines, N.C., pediatrician &lt;a href="https://sandhillspeds.com/staff/christoph-diasio-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Christoph Diasio&lt;/a&gt; says he's had many conversations in recent weeks with families who are interested in getting their children vaccinated against measles earlier than what's usually recommended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first dose of the MMR vaccine is usually given between 12 and 15 months of age, with a second dose administered between the ages of 4 and 6 years. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20children%20get%20two,date%20on%20their%20MMR%20vaccination." target="_blank"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says infants as young as 6 months old can receive the MMR vaccine if they are traveling abroad or are in an outbreak area.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diasio says families with children younger than 12 months are requesting the shot early, especially if they have travel plans for spring break.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Several families have asked what our game plan is if we get measles in our community," Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In some cases, Diasio says, his patient families have delayed travel plans until their children are old enough to receive the MMR shot.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The main thing I'm hearing from my patients is not, 'Oh, my gosh, I'm so scared of that measles vaccine. It's more like, can I have one? Should I get an extra?" Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says one mother he spoke with recently was worried about the potential that unvaccinated relatives could contract measles while flying cross-country to visit her. "It's awful that this is now a discussion we have to have," Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Interest in vaccinations has ramped up ahead of the spring break travel season, says &lt;a href="https://pediatricpartners.pediatrust.com/Our-Team/Susan-Sirota,-MD" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Susan Sirota&lt;/a&gt;, a primary care pediatrician in the Chicago area.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have many patients calling us because they are traveling to either Texas or places near Texas, or states where they suspect that vaccination rates are lower than we have in Illinois," Sirota says. "Many families are requesting early MMR [vaccines]."&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the measles outbreaks are driving interest in vaccinations, Sirota says they're not the only factor at play. She says many families she works with follow the news, and they worry that vaccines may become less accessible in the future now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281452/trump-cabinet-picks-rfk-confirmation-hearing-help-committee" target="_blank"&gt; a longtime critic of vaccines,&lt;/a&gt; is the head of the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"What I'm seeing is that there's a bit of fear among moms and dads and parents about their ability to protect their children and to prevent diseases because vaccine access is in question for them," Sirota says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it's not just the measles vaccine. Sirota says some patients are worried about access to the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5323229/hpv-vaccine-cancer-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; which protects against human papillomavirus.  HPV is best known for causing cervical cancer, but can also cause other malignancies, including cancer of the throat and anus. Kennedy has been involved in legal challenges to that vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he wouldn't take vaccines away from anyone. He has called vaccines a personal choice. NPR reached out to HHS for comment about their plans to maintain people's access to vaccines. They did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's too soon to tell whether anecdotal reports of vaccine enthusiasm will help counter longer-term trends toward growing vaccine hesitancy. According to one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38806351/" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt;, 1 in 5 U.S. parents are now hesitant about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And studying changes in these attitudes may be harder in the future: The National Institutes of Health has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325863/nih-trump-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-research" target="_blank"&gt;terminated millions of dollars worth of grants&lt;/a&gt; for research to study vaccine hesitancy and how to improve immunization levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            “Kids! Are one of you taking my lorazepams?” Victoria Ratliff (played by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/entertainment/parker-posey-white-lotus/index.html"&gt;Parker Posey&lt;/a&gt;) asks her children in a scene from this season’s “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/24/entertainment/white-lotus-season-3-episode-6-recap/index.html"&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0007356msg65twik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just had my prescription filled, and I can tell some are missing,” she says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0008356mlkc48nzb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By this point in the series, the viewer knows that it’s not her children Victoria needs to worry about, it’s her husband, Timothy (Jason Isaacs).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0009356mc3h3ka75@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just one episode earlier, Victoria tells Timothy that he looks tired and should take a nap (as we know, it’s actually crippling anxiety due to events unfolding at home). She offers him a pill from her prescription bottle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000c356ms6zap0w0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re not addictive. I just take them when I need it,” she says. “You make fun of me, but they work. Not a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000d356mq1an4syq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682053.html" target="_blank"&gt;lorazepam&lt;/a&gt; is actually a big deal; it’s a powerful &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/benzodiazepines" target="_blank"&gt;benzodiazepine&lt;/a&gt; used to treat anxiety disorders. And although it can be a very effective medication, it should be taken only as prescribed by a doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000e356moh5687cf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What else do you need to know about this scene-stealing drug? I asked &lt;a href="https://drgailsaltz.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Gail Saltz&lt;/a&gt;, who serves as a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at &lt;a href="https://www.nyp.org/locations/newyork-presbyterian-weill-cornell-medical-center" target="_blank"&gt;New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, to share her expertise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000f356mwjgsgc0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Our conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000g356mret9tp9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to being a big fan of the show, you’re a doctor who prescribes this very medication. What did you think when you first saw it enter the storyline?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000h356mdg5fhoq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Gail Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; I thought, “Wow, people get their information about psychiatric care – and all medical care – from watching shows like this, and I really hope they get it right.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000i356mq44sggnf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Who is lorazepam right for, and how does it work?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000j356mjj2koqf4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Lorazepam is in the class of medications called benzodiazepines, which is a depressant, and also sometimes referred to as a sedative hypnotic medication. It works by increasing a neurotransmitter in your brain called GABA, and that is what makes it somewhat sedating, which is a primary focus of the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000k356mhuv85ac4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is often used to treat short-term high anxiety or panic – panic attacks, specifically – and even sometimes short-term sleep difficulty.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000l356mnkvbzawa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Benzodiazepines across the board are highly addictive, both physiologically and psychologically, meaning that one, over time, develops a tolerance to this drug. And so the effects that you do initially get – “I have less anxiety” – will, with the same dose, wane, and you will require more of that medication to have the same effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000m356mw8utnlq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; What sorts of things do people with a lorazepam prescription need to keep in mind when they’re taking this drug?&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000n356mymlb6i2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; They need to know the physical effects of this drug, which matter in terms of their safety:
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/list/instances/cm8q8ybe50020356mkun1h6k6@published" class="list " data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
  &lt;ul data-editable="items" class="list__items list__items--ul"&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.0.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Sedation:&lt;/strong&gt; You probably shouldn’t drive a car or operate any heavy machinery.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Loss of motor control:&lt;/strong&gt; Again, machinery, driving.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Muscle relaxation:&lt;/strong&gt; In the world of anxiety, this is a good thing, but something to be aware of.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Dizziness:&lt;/strong&gt; Take your first dose in a safe place with someone around, to make sure you’re steady and not a fall risk on this medication.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            They need to be aware that if taken in large doses – essentially an overdose – you can have what’s called &lt;strong&gt;respiratory depression&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning you stop breathing.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q88zlx001k356mt34ymq08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why this drug can be dangerous if you take too much or – and this is very important – take it with other medications that cause central nervous system sedation, such as alcohol, opiates, barbiturates, sleeping pills and even some old-style antihistamines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000p356mo06mpg42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the potential for abuse with lorazepam? What are the risks?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000q356mxs1t0ixj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re taking this for anxiety, for example, as we see in the show – and I would say that Victoria appears to be taking it for social anxiety, when she’s going to go have to be with other people – which is different than Timothy, who is just flooded and in a state of utter traumatic panic and is just popping them indiscriminately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000r356mvvmtaa54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When you have a positive response, that is what makes a drug psychologically addictive, which is not physiologically addictive. It’s not dangerous, but what it does do is make you want to take more, right? Because anxiety feels bad – really bad – and when you can take a medication that makes you relax and not experience the anxiety, it’s positively reinforcing. Of course you’d want to take that medication again. It made you feel better.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000s356mua8k512t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there anyone who would not be a good candidate for a lorazepam prescription?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000t356mkjzvxj7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, people who need one of these cross-reactive medications that you’re genuinely concerned about the sedative effects. Somebody who is abusing alcohol. Somebody who is abusing other drugs or has really struggled with sobriety, with serious addiction. We try to find ways around prescribing other addictive medication, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000u356mud7l3g05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Victoria is keenly aware of how many pills she has – or is supposed to have. Is this a more complicated prescription to get or fill than, say, antibiotics?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000v356m5xabzqum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz: &lt;/strong&gt;Absolutely. It’s considered a controlled substance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000w356m4ox3gzpj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Generally, physicians can prescribe lorazepam, but it is a different level of prescription where the doctor can’t just call it in on the phone. They are going to look at how many they’re prescribing you, as well as if – and how many – refills they would offer you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000x356msibrvoyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kind of like we do with opioids, if a patient is blowing through them faster than anticipated via the prescription, there needs to be discussion with the patient of, “Why? Where did that go? What is happening? Do you legitimately need more? OK, maybe this is an underdosing. Let’s discuss that. What symptoms are you having? Or are you heading toward tolerance?” And we have to think about what to do here.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000y356msulynyxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; During another scene in the show, we see Timothy taking these pills while drinking heavily. That can lead to very serious interactions, right?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000z356mw7jpb29x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, yes. Alcohol specifically interacts with benzodiazepines. They both affect the GABA system. They both can cause, on their own, respiratory depression and death – meaning you stop breathing and die. But together, they are what’s called synergistic, meaning it makes each of them have more of that effect than the two of them on their own. So it’s dangerous. That’s why they tell you not to drink when you’re taking lorazepam.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0010356m5rh9fza7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So yeah, he’s pounding them. And you know, it would not be a plot twist that Timothy doesn’t wake up in the morning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0011356mhv2b5xf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By the way, you see Victoria – after her lorazepam disappears, because Timothy has swiped it altogether – now drinking a lot more. And that is probably because, in addition to being stressed about [spoiler redacted], she doesn’t have the medication to cover her, so she’s drinking.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0012356m5ap8w9g8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; In the same episode, Timothy steals a security guard’s gun that he forgot to lock up – and later we see him seriously contemplate suicide. While we aren’t inside (show creator, writer and director) &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/entertainment/mike-white-career-white-lotus/index.html"&gt;Mike White&lt;/a&gt;’s head, is suicidal ideation a known potential side effect of this drug, or do you think this is more likely the result of everything else Timothy is going through?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0013356mh0qh2hje@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Lorazepam by itself does not cause suicidal ideation, but it is disinhibiting – meaning thoughts that might come into your mind, that you might go, “Oh, no, no, no. I don’t want that thought. Can’t have that thought,” and I push it away. Your ability to suppress it is really not there. So whatever thoughts you’re having would be disinhibited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0014356mmcpvxhv5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Timothy’s situation, all by itself, would cause depression. Depression drives suicidal ideation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0015356mwdsjesvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another feature of lorazepam that is adding to that is basically poor cognitive functioning. Lorazepam literally slows your thoughts. It’s called thought deceleration. And in slowing your thoughts, your ability to problem-solve – which he clearly needs right now – is impaired. And so he is probably feeling like he cannot think his way out of anything right now, and this is a very dire situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0016356mhbaptcor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Now that Timothy has stolen Victoria’s entire prescription bottle, is she going to experience any withdrawal symptoms? What does that look like?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0017356me1e1cipi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; The question will be, how frequently was Victoria taking this lorazepam? Was this a prescription that was basically like, “Here are 30 lorazepam for the month”?

            If she knows, “I’m going to dinner and I have to be at a resort and socialize with other people, and this makes me feel panicky, I can take a lorazepam for the dinner, and I’ll be OK,” but she’s not taking it during the day or any other time, she’s probably not addicted. She’s probably OK from a physiologic standpoint.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If someone who is taking lorazepam more regularly abruptly stops this medication after they are tolerant to it or addicted – which can be a matter of just a couple weeks – you can have a spike in blood pressure. You can have a whole host of very miserable flu-like feelings, confusion, and actually, these things can rise to the level of causing death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It’s a very serious medication to be aware of its easy abuse potential, even in a person who has no intention of abusing it. We have yet to see in the plot whether that will come to pass, but it is something I as a psychiatrist have been concerned about as I watch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Some people, in consultation with their doctor, will absolutely benefit from a lorazepam prescription. But not everyone with anxiety needs this medication. What are some other tried-and-true ways to manage anxiety?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; If you struggle with anxiety, there are a lot of coping tools that you can build into your day that will help you manage it and not get to the level of an anxiety disorder. Those run the gamut from things like a regular practice of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/07/health/breathing-stress-relief-calm-wellness/index.html"&gt;paced deep breathing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/11/health/progressive-muscle-relaxation-mindfulness-wellness/index.html"&gt;progressive muscle relaxation&lt;/a&gt;, 30 minutes of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/health/exercise-stress-heart-disease-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt; a day with your heart rate up, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;talking to somebody&lt;/a&gt; about whatever you’re anxious about. That could be someone supportive in your world. That could be a therapist. I always say that should be your first stop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; A main character dies at the end of every season of “The White Lotus.” Do you want to go on the record with who you think is going to die this season? Just two episodes left!
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know why I’m even saying this exactly. It’s just some general gestalt feeling. But I feel this sad feeling like, what’s the name of Rick’s girlfriend again? Chelsea! She’s the one character that maybe I can feel some compassion for on the show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz001f356mqdui3qng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chelsea is sort of a lost soul, decent person – seemingly, so far, right? Bad things keep happening to Chelsea, and she’s heralding that this really has meaning to her. She’s anticipating bad things. And so, I don’t know if they’re foreshadowing her in that way, but for me, it’s resonating as, you know – they never take out the truly horrendous people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

A test ordered by a veterinarian came back positive for bird flu. Within days, Kira’s condition had deteriorated — she became lethargic and had trouble breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After several trips to the vet and emergency room in Portland, Oregon, where Hanson lives, he made the painful decision to put Kira down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She was the happiest cat I’ve ever had,” he said. “You’d walk past her and she’d do a little back flip and get on her back so you could rub her belly. She did that in the hospital the last night… She just very lethargically flopped on her back so we could rub her belly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The manufacturer of the pet food, Wild Coast Pet Foods, subsequently &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/voluntary-recall-wild-coast-raw-boneless-free-range-chicken-formula-raw-pet-food-because-possible" target="_blank"&gt;recalled lots of the formula&lt;/a&gt; Kira had consumed due to potential bird flu contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hanson filed a lawsuit against the company earlier this month, alleging that it had failed to disclose the risk of bird flu in its raw pet food. He is seeking roughly $8,000 to cover the cost of Kira’s veterinary bills. Wild Coast did not respond to a request for comment. In &lt;a href="https://wildcoastpets.com/wild-coast-safety-steps-for-h5n1/" target="_blank"&gt;a letter to customers&lt;/a&gt;, the company said it had “transitioned to fully cooked poultry recipes to eliminate any potential risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg" alt="Tim Hanson’s cat Kira in the hospital."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Tim Hanson’s cat Kira in the hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Tim Hanson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the U.S. Agriculture Department, 126 domestic cats in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank"&gt;have been infected with bird flu&lt;/a&gt; since 2022. Around half of those cases were recorded this year, and many were exposed through food or milk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We see continued reports of cats with bird flu infection from across the country, and it’s kept increasing in the past months,” said Suresh Kuchipudi, professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In cats, bird flu tends to be swift and lethal. Although the overall risk to indoor cats is low, Kuchipudi and other experts who study or diagnose the infections say the threat is mounting. With bird flu spreading rampantly among poultry and cattle, there is a constant opportunity for the virus to enter the raw food supply. And while there’s no evidence yet that cats can transmit bird flu to people, the potential increases as more cats get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t have the evidence, but it doesn’t mean that it may not have happened, or it can’t happen,” Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;At least 3 pet food recalls in 4 months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most pet food is heated to a high enough temperature to kill pathogens before it’s packaged, but bird flu can linger in raw food if it’s sourced from infected poultry — for instance, from chickens that were culled due to an outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The animals that were depopulated could potentially have ended up in the food chain for pets,” said Laura Goodman, an assistant professor at Cornell University’s Baker Institute for Animal Health. “It’s not uncommon for substandard meat to end up in the pet food chain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the last four months, at least three pet food manufacturers have recalled batches containing raw poultry. The Food and Drug Administration in January &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/cvm-updates/cat-and-dog-food-manufacturers-required-consider-h5n1-food-safety-plans" target="_blank"&gt;warned manufacturers using uncooked meat&lt;/a&gt; to reassess their food safety plans in light of the recent cat illnesses and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Other cats have been exposed to bird flu on dairy farms, likely from drinking raw milk from infected cows. And in some instances, outdoor cats have picked up the virus directly from dead birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm#contribAff" target="_blank"&gt;report in February&lt;/a&gt; also described two indoor cats that lived with dairy farm workers and contracted bird flu. The research suggests that “individuals who are working on dairies or hauling milk have the potential to carry virus into their house on their clothing or on their shoes, and in turn the cats then are exposed,” said Kimberly Dodd, dean of the Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine, who coauthored the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There is no active surveillance for bird flu in healthy cats, so cases could be underreported. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11528901/#sec26" target="_blank"&gt;study of stray cats&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands found that nearly 12% were positive for bird flu antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We may be only testing the sickest cats or one cat from a household. It’s very likely that there have been many cases out there that the cat was not brought to a veterinarian or testing wasn’t done,” said Kristy Pabilonia, director of veterinary diagnostic laboratories at Colorado State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Pabilonia oversaw the diagnostic testing for a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/hairless_leo/" target="_blank"&gt;hairless cat named Leonardo DiCaprio&lt;/a&gt;, who was found to have bird flu in January. Leo’s owner, Steve Werfelmann, said his cat had eaten chicken-based raw pet food from the company Savage Pet, which &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/savage-pet-recalls-savage-cat-food-chicken-large-and-small-boxes-because-possible-bird-flu-health?fbclid=IwY2xjawJJx4hleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHUGDboc0G0uQ72RfJYtFDWs67vQGhADUsWqPNkQWjIBCbssoHvywlAjrdA_aem_pwkkhTKW7ScKMDWox9C35A" target="_blank"&gt;recalled dozens of batches&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg" alt="Steve Werfelmann's cat Leo."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Steve Werfelmann's cat Leo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Steve Werfelmann&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When we adopted him, that was the recommended food” for his skin, Werfelmann said. “But then talking to the vet and going through this process, they actually told us there’s no real scientific evidence to back up raw food being better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Savage Pet referred NBC News to &lt;a href="https://savagecatfood.com/avian-influenza/" target="_blank"&gt;an online statement&lt;/a&gt;, which says “all of our poultry ingredients are USDA inspected and passed for human consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The current bird flu strain, which began spreading among wild birds and poultry in the U.S. in 2022, often causes severe neurological symptoms in cats, such as seizures and blindness, as well as difficulty breathing and discharge from the eyes and nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Cats may be seen circling or having a head tilt or just acting very abnormally. Some of those clinical signs are very similar to what we see in rabies,” Dodd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Leo didn’t show neurological symptoms, aside from wobbliness in his back legs, Werfelmann said. Instead, his main symptoms were fever, lethargy and not eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We thought he was going to die,” Werfelmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Colorado Department of Agriculture announced this month that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/coloradoag/photos/colorado-has-detected-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai-h5n1-in-11-domestic/1180459680757615/" target="_blank"&gt;11 domestic cats there&lt;/a&gt; had gotten bird flu from raw poultry or pet food. Leo was the only one to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘It’s the milk’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists are still trying to understand what makes bird flu so deadly in cats. The virus is highly fatal to birds but seems to affect cats more severely than some other mammals. Far fewer cases have been recorded in dogs, and though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 1,000 dairy herds have been affected&lt;/a&gt;, the disease tends to be milder in cows. In people, only one of the 70 cases recorded in the U.S. has been fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kuchipudi’s &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2024.2440498#abstract" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has identified receptors throughout cats’ bodies that allow them to be infected by a broad range of flu viruses, including H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When you examine these animals, the virus is everywhere in the body,” he said. “It causes a systemic infection that is potentially very severe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Joseph Journell lost two of his cats, Alexander and Tuxedo, to bird flu just days apart in November. He had been giving them raw milk, believing it to contain extra nutrients. A third cat, Big Boy, also got sick after drinking the milk and wound up in critical condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg" alt="Joseph Journell's cats, including Big Boy, left."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Joseph Journell's cats, including Big Boy, left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Joseph Journell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I said, ‘Whatever’s wrong with Big Boy is the same thing wrong with Tuxsie and then obviously the same thing wrong with Alexander,’” said Journell, who lives in San Bernardino, California. “It’s the milk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Big Boy tested positive for bird flu via a urine sample in December. He has since recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The milk the three cats consumed came from a California dairy farm called Raw Farm LLC, according to Journell’s lawyer. The farm &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bird-flu-detected-second-lot-raw-milk-sold-california-health-officials-rcna182152" target="_blank"&gt;issued a recall&lt;/a&gt; after California health officials said samples were positive for bird flu. The farm did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment, but in &lt;a href="https://rawfarmusa.com/blog/recall-was-unfounded-and-is-now-lifted" target="_blank"&gt;an online statement&lt;/a&gt; last month, it said the recall had been “unfounded” and that there was “no evidence of adulterated product connecting to any consumer illness.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg" alt="cat cats feline raw milk"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Big Boy and Alexander drink raw milk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Joseph Journell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Like Hanson in Oregon, Journell decided to pursue legal action. His lawyer sent a letter in January to the owner of Raw Farm, indicating Journell’s intent to recoup more than $16,000 in veterinary expenses, lost wages and caretaker fees for Big Boy. They hope to mediate the situation with the company outside of court but plan to file suit if that’s not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;A threat to humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When the veterinary office learned about Kira’s raw food diet, Hanson said, they suspected bird flu right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They immediately put on their PPE,” Hanson said. “I was taken aback.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although there’s some evidence that cats can pass bird flu to each other, there’s no evidence so far that they have transmitted the virus to people. However, the more the virus spreads in cats, the more opportunities it has to mutate and get better at spreading to humans. Outdoor cats, in particular, could serve as a transmission “bridge” between wild animals and domestic pets or humans, Kuchipudi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vet-catches-bird-flu-cat-new-york-n699316" target="_blank"&gt;a veterinarian at a New York City animal shelter&lt;/a&gt; tested positive for a different strain of bird flu, H7N2, after contact with sick cats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We need to be aware of these ongoing circulations that could potentially complicate the disease transmission and also [pose] a risk to human health,” Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hanson said he was tested for bird flu after Kira died and was negative. In his cat’s final days, he said, he wore an N95 mask around her and washed his clothes upon returning home from the animal hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He hopes his story will serve as a warning to other cat owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I don’t want any more cats dying,” he said. “Hopefully people can learn from Kira’s passing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE96cER2UzAxN1JuaVhkWGRoV0NMUTJyNmxNLXFhckZ0eWpIRk5SbC1UOV9OLVBwdmhVekxFWkcxVTFVZGpkQXFlV05KbzR3czRXRXdORGJjQV84TkY5R1RCX1YyRDBrcUZsek1nandHcVJZM1hWMFHSAVZBVV95cUxOTDNlU05mM2RsaHl2aWZEdUlIeTFfR2F1dXo2eDJPNXREZDhIYlZUNHlsMDVQRHl2UEZyaWk4VXhBNWNwX1ZuSTFjb2g1U09Pc3BJNlBJUQ</guid></item><item><title>Avoid sugary soda, play pickleball, eat peanut butter and jelly — plus 10 more health tips to help you have a great week - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi9wFBVV95cUxPU1BJM0F6V3hEVXp4UkFPWnpoNzlfaHdsOWxRRFBsVWFuUFdUWXFXa3IxZ2dnMXZ0OTI2S21ZNXpNQ1E0RVVGZC1ZMmVLTXBMUm16ZFZXY0Rid3pNbVY2T0dEX0JobjZBUEpUUXZYZEVkUmRGNUF6M0NjcUVkSHB5ZXpYNUxycUtiUUNRS0dqQ1AwNFlxU0QwV0ozN1A0WkZfSklhZWFwOURySTZWNWlXdTFseERmbW9Tb2pSZ1VvQzlNZXFyc2tobU81ZHJfU3lhZmI5RXB3SjRjS1EwNHJXcWlTNTA3Yi04VjRveHIwYjhmM1poZDhF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hello, Yahoo Life readers!

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slh2jw003j26qh1an09l6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When health workers stopped visiting her home in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/asia/pakistan-balochistan-train-hostage-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; to administer &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/health/tuberculosis-outbreak-kansas/index.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; medication, Ratna Jamni began dragging herself to a clinic “step by painful step, when even standing feels impossible.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slhlsk0002356mlympy5wx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 40-year-old had been receiving treatment and mental health support for months at home after contracting drug-resistant TB, but those visits have all stopped.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slhlsk0003356mmru5vbcq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every trip is painful, exhausting and humiliating. I don’t know how much longer I can do this,” she told CNN via the Dopasi Foundation, a Pakistan-based NGO whose &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/politics/trump-admin-terminates-syria-white-helmets-funding/index.html"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;-funded programs helped provide her health care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slh4r20000356mt3hs59qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The journey is long, my body is weak, and every breath feels heavier than the last. I wonder if it’s even worth it. I wish this suffering would end – either the help returns or I no longer have to endure this pain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sli0o70009356me4h0lmoq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tuberculosis, a bacterial infection usually found in the lungs, remains the world’s top infectious killer,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;causing 1.25 million deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slhyxb0007356me837im0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the right health care and drugs, TB is treatable and preventable. Without treatment, it has a death rate of close to 50%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slicgy000c356md6gyznzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like that of millions of other TB patients across the world, Jamni’s treatment was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). It has now been interrupted by the Trump administration’s sudden freezing, and subsequent cutting, of vast swathes of the agency’s funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljcl7000h356mloa01qnr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aid groups and doctors warn that these cuts are likely to cause thousands of unnecessary deaths and a rise in TB infections worldwide, including in the US itself; and create the conditions for an extremely drug-resistant form of the disease to spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljaf6000f356mpc6g44ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Already, more than 11,000 additional TB patients are estimated to have died in the two months since almost all USAID funding froze on January 24, according to a model built by UN-affiliated organization Stop TB Partnership.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slji1e000k356m6e50bv88@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            TB infections are also expected to increase by 28-32% globally this year as a result of the cuts, according to a memo issued by a top USAID official, Nicholas Enrich, who was placed on administrative leave. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljxkf000p356m7dad3rtp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The State Department, which now handles queries for USAID, told CNN that certain TB programs are “active today in more than a dozen countries,” in line “with Secretary (of State Marco) Rubio’s exemption for life-saving humanitarian assistance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljxkf000q356mp6d5wu2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These programs are helping to find and cure hundreds of thousands of cases of tuberculosis by providing access to low-cost, life-saving testing and medicine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljv94000n356m8iu2qiky@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US funding was an integral part of the global TB response, distributing grants both directly to 24&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;national governments whose countries have high rates of the disease and via international or local non-governmental organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slkd6g000v356mo3m0kol5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            USAID was deeply enmeshed in global HIV/AIDS health care too, and TB is the leading cause of death for people with HIV, according to WHO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slkp1t000y356mcsnj42zn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike previous changes in funding flows, which came with prior warning, this freeze is unprecedented in both its scale and abruptness, meaning that it’s “very difficult for these countries overnight to find the resources” to plug the gap, Dr. Lucica Ditiu, CEO of the UN-affiliated Stop TB Partnership, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll9gr0013356m6s2byd5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And while local aid groups call for a shift to domestic funding, the situation right now is deteriorating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll9gr0014356m49tdoyq5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the 27 countries worst affected by the cuts, that funding gap is leading to “crippling breakdowns in their TB response with devastating consequences,” WHO said in a statement on March 20.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll1ry0011356mmz1xm2nj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The precise nature of the impact has varied worldwide, depending on the role USAID played in the network of funding streams contributing to each country’s TB program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slln0i0019356miff8tjhv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In almost half of Mozambique, for example, no one can currently be diagnosed with TB, since US funding supported its lab networks and system that transported samples of spit and mucus, Ditiu said. Some programs, like Stop TB Partnership’s Global Drug Facility, which facilitates global access to relatively cheap drugs, have had some funding restored by temporary waivers, Ditiu said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sllky80017356mjuscco4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But more have not, and nine countries are struggling to procure TB drugs, threatening patients’ access to them, WHO said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slluu8001c356m2kqxndvx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health workers based in Cambodia, Pakistan, Nigeria, South Africa and Eswatini told CNN the biggest cuts to their programs were mostly in active case-finding, which allows for earlier diagnosis to stem the spread of disease, and in community outreach.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slm9cq001h356mlnxnu2io@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One such USAID-funded program in Cambodia, run by local HIV and TB organization KHANA, had screened more than 780,000 people for TB in remote areas, traced more than 16,000 close contacts of TB patients and supported more than 800 patients with multi-drug-resistant TB during the past five years, according to its executive director, Choub Sok Chamreun.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slm43r001f356mwjdmteuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All that work has now stopped. As a result, the number of new TB cases reported in the region has dropped from about 650-850 per month to just 250 in February, meaning that hundreds are going undiagnosed and without care, Chamreun told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slmfz9001k356mga3nnwly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This means that people don’t come to services. It means that the infection continues to spread over the community … it means that the aim to end TB by 2030 is impossible,” he said, referencing the UN’s goal to largely eliminate the disease by the end of the decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sln919001n356m95inns92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similarly, another case-finding program supported by USAID in 27 of Pakistan’s districts has ceased, along with the means of transporting sputum samples, and community monitoring that aims to identify any barriers to TB treatment, Kinz ul Eman, CEO of the Dopasi Foundation, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnqgw001s356mcm4yvid1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sudden cuts also mean immediately laying off field health workers who “actually risked their life to support your project activity, to support their community,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnqgw001t356makt7r4oi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            TB disproportionately affects marginalised communities and people living in poverty for whom government health care is less accessible, making such outreach even more important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnkoh001q356mz6yyqs1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One such program, overseen by Dr. Steven John, an official at the Ministry of Health in Adamawa State, Nigeria, was implementing TB health care for nomadic populations there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slo20g001y356mfslcy4dl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the funding freeze, his program can no longer reach the 60-70% of the community who have yet to access its services, even as people there “approach the organization (saying) ‘When are you coming?’” he told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnw50001w356mnzamp58i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Suddenly restricting access to drugs and treatment also creates the conditions for a mutated, multi-drug-resistant strain of TB to thrive as patients partway through a four- or six-month treatment regimen may be forced to stop taking them, aid groups and doctors say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sloqc50025356mn8p8gc71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Anytime you cease a treatment in the middle of the course of therapy, you promote the selection of drug resistance and people then become contagious again to others in their community,” explained Dr. Kenneth Castro, a professor at Emory University who previously served as director of the division for tuberculosis elimination at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slojge0023356mbbdz6xi0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Very few drugs can treat such an extreme form of TB. “You create, basically, a bug which is virtually resistant to what we have,” said Ditiu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002a356m3v4gkfrt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That risk is magnified since a lot of USAID’s funding, especially in Africa, focused on supporting people living with multi-drug-resistant TB, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002b356mtt3nwla8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And anecdotal reports of patients stopping their courses of medication are already emerging. One patient in Uganda started sharing her medication with her husband, meaning they are both taking half the prescribed amount, Bruce Tushabe, an official at advocacy group the AIDS and Rights Alliance for Southern Africa, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002c356mbj9urm7w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another person who used to get medication from a specialist, now-closed clinic can’t stand in the queues at the general clinics due to the stigma TB patients still face, Tushabe added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002d356mojec29i3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As TB rates rise globally, they are likely to increase in the US as well, said Castro, while pointing out that the country still has one of the world’s lowest rates of the disease at 2.9 cases per 100,000 people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sloss80028356mkunqgsrl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nonetheless, warning signs are lighting up – in January, the Kansas City metro area was hit by a wave of TB, causing dozens of illnesses and at least two deaths. And childhood TB cases in Europe rose by 10% in 2023, showing that transmission of the disease is still ongoing, WHO said on Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp68o002g356mj725kj5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The irony,” Castro added, “is that these disinvestments end up resulting at higher cost to recover and mitigate the damage done.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

              &lt;/div&gt;

Tiny and mute beneath the stacked rows of medical students, she is paraded for their benefit by a consultant psychiatrist some 44 years her senior. It is 1966 – the peak of Swinging 60s’ hedonism, liberalism and youthful counterculture – but in a locked psychiatric ward in London’s Royal Waterloo hospital, unspeakable violations are being inflicted upon patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The perpetrator-in-chief, William Sargant, is the subject of thriller writer Jon Stock’s first nonfiction book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-sleep-room-9780349128894/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Sleep Room: A Very British Medical Scandal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. One of the most notorious figures in British psychiatry, Sargant initially wished to be a physician. He pivoted to psychiatry after one of his earliest pieces of research met with a humiliating reception at the Royal College of Physicians, causing him to suffer a nervous breakdown and spend time in a psychiatric hospital himself. At this time – the 1930s – effective psychiatric treatments were virtually non-existent. Serious mental illness usually led to lifelong incarceration in an asylum. But the therapeutic nihilism of psychiatry was shifting towards optimism. Psychiatrists began experimenting with so-called “heroic” therapies, such as putting patients into insulin comas or giving them electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to try to “reset” their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"books","tags":[{"id":"books/scienceandnature","type":"Keyword","title":"Science and nature books"},{"id":"books/series/observer-book-of-the-week","type":"Series","title":"Observer book of the week"},{"id":"books/books","type":"Keyword","title":"Books"},{"id":"society/psychiatry","type":"Keyword","title":"Psychiatry"},{"id":"books/healthmindandbody","type":"Keyword","title":"Health, mind and body books"},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"Keyword","title":"Culture"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"Tone","title":"Reviews"},{"id":"profile/rachel-clarke2","type":"Contributor","title":"Rachel Clarke","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/06/15/Rachel-Clarke.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=51c29f213037939471b9112192dce124","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/06/15/Rachel_Clarke,_R.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=2e37d5bd253b6ea6021f4af2337fa608"},{"id":"publication/theobserver","type":"Publication","title":"The Observer"},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"The New Review"},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/books","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Books"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","type":"Tracking","title":"Observer New Review"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"books/2025/mar/30/the-sleep-room-by-jon-stock-a-very-british-medical-scandal-william-sargant-review-a-horrifying-study-of-medical-abuse","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","switches":{"lightbox":true,"prebidCriteo":true,"personaliseSignInGateAfterCheckout":true,"abSignInGateMainVariant":true,"prebidAppnexusUkRow":true,"prebidMagnite":true,"commercialMetrics":true,"prebidTrustx":true,"scAdFreeBanner":false,"adaptiveSite":true,"prebidPermutiveAudience":true,"compareVariantDecision":false,"enableSentryReporting":true,"lazyLoadContainers":true,"ampArticleSwitch":false,"remarketing":true,"articleEndSlot":true,"keyEventsCarousel":true,"registerWithPhone":false,"darkModeWeb":true,"targeting":true,"remoteHeader":true,"slotBodyEnd":true,"ampPrebidOzone":false,"extendedMostPopularFronts":true,"emailInlineInFooter":true,"showNewPrivacyWordingOnEmailSignupEmbeds":true,"prebidAnalytics":true,"extendedMostPopular":true,"ampContentAbTesting":false,"imrWorldwide":true,"acast":true,"twitterUwt":true,"abAuxiaSignInGate":true,"abDeferPermutiveLoad":true,"prebidAppnexusInvcode":true,"ampPrebidPubmatic":false,"a9HeaderBidding":true,"prebidAppnexus":true,"enableDiscussionSwitch":true,"prebidXaxis":true,"stickyVideos":true,"interactiveFullHeaderSwitch":true,"discussionAllPageSize":true,"prebidUserSync":true,"audioOnwardJourneySwitch":true,"brazeTaylorReport":false,"externalVideoEmbeds":true,"abTheTradeDesk":true,"callouts":true,"sentinelLogger":true,"geoMostPopular":true,"weAreHiring":false,"relatedContent":true,"thirdPartyEmbedTracking":true,"prebidOzone":true,"ampLiveblogSwitch":false,"ampAmazon":false,"prebidAdYouLike":true,"mostViewedFronts":true,"optOutAdvertising":true,"abSignInGateMainControl":true,"googleSearch":true,"brazeSwitch":true,"prebidKargo":true,"consentManagement":true,"idProfileNavigation":true,"confiantAdVerification":true,"discussionAllowAnonymousRecommendsSwitch":false,"absoluteServerTimes":false,"permutive":true,"comscore":true,"ampPrebidCriteo":false,"prebidTheTradeDesk":true,"newsletterOnwards":false,"youtubeIma":true,"webFonts":true,"liveBlogTopSponsorship":true,"ophan":true,"crosswordSvgThumbnails":true,"prebidTriplelift":true,"prebidPubmatic":true,"serverShareCounts":false,"autoRefresh":true,"enhanceTweets":true,"prebidIndexExchange":true,"prebidOpenx":true,"prebidHeaderBidding":true,"idCookieRefresh":true,"discussionPageSize":true,"smartAppBanner":false,"historyTags":true,"brazeContentCards":true,"remoteBanner":true,"emailSignupRecaptcha":true,"prebidSmart":true,"shouldLoadGoogletag":true,"inizio":true,"europeBetaFront":true,"prebidBidCache":false},"contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sargant firmly believed that a broken brain was no different to any other damaged organ or limb, and best fixed with aggressive physical treatment. Not for him the namby-pamby chitchat of Freud’s “sofa merchants” and their spurious talking cures. Rather, psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia could all be cured with excessive doses of drugs and electricity, or, if they failed, with surgical lobotomy. Sargant’s patients were sequestered away behind locked doors on the top floor of the hospital. The most infamous part of his ward was a six-bedded area known as the Sleep Room. Here, the patients, nearly all of whom were female, were drugged into long-term stupors, being roused from their beds only to be fed, washed or given innumerable doses of ECT. A typical “narcosis” treatment comprised three months of near-total unconsciousness, after which time the patient had often been reduced to a “walking zombie” with permanent memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Even as someone who learned, as a medical student, about the unspeakable mid-century vogue for lobotomy, some of the accounts made my skin crawl&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sleep Room&lt;/em&gt; is peppered with haunting first-hand accounts of horrific treatment at the hands of William Sargant. The actor Celia Imrie, for example, the aforementioned child, was admitted under Sargant’s care because she was close to death from anorexia nervosa. She recounts being forced to drink such large doses of chlorpromazine – the first antipsychotic - that she dribbled, shook uncontrollably and found her hair in clumps on her pillow. She was injected daily with enough insulin to make her drowsy, weak, sweaty and near comatose. She remembers other women around her having huge rubber plugs jammed between their teeth before the high-voltage electricity of ECT was sent through their temples, and their bodies “shuddered and jerked” with the “scent of burning hair and flesh”. Sometimes a patient would reappear on the ward with their head thickly bandaged, scarcely able to walk after being lobotomised. Amid the moans, screams and stale stench of sleep, Imrie recalls the nurses reporting her own resistance to the drugs to Sargant, to which he ominously responded: “every dog has his breaking point”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;To say that these stories are difficult to read is an understatement. Even as someone who learned, as a medical student, about the unspeakable mid-century vogue for lobotomy – permanently subduing patients by gouging out parts of their frontal lobes – some of the accounts made my skin crawl. It is to Stock’s great credit that he places patient testimony centre stage, allowing several patients to tell their stories at length in their own, unedited words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sargant himself is depicted as a sinister, all-powerful, “simian” monster who ran his ward as a personal fiefdom in which he could pursue, unchecked, his conviction that effective treatments worked by physically erasing and reprogramming disturbed minds. A darker benefit of his Sleep Room was the absolute power it gave him over his charges. Once rendered unconscious, a patient could be subjected to treatments they might otherwise never have consented to, such as scores, or even hundreds, of doses of ECT. As Sargant himself put it: “What is so valuable is that they generally have no memory about the actual length of the treatment or the number of ECT used.” Before long, colleagues had nicknamed him “Bill the Brain Slicer” and “Sargant the Shock”. His fascination with techniques for brainwashing led to speculation that he may have collaborated with the CIA’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKUltra" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;MKUltra&lt;/a&gt; programme into mind control, though no definitive proof of this is provided by Stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7257b788-1e22-4a45-a5a3-47a0c96d5176" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;The Royal Waterloo hospital for children and women, in London, where Sargant undertook his ‘narcosis’ treatments.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Panoramic Images/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;At least five of Sargant’s patients died during narcosis. The dangers of artificially prolonged sleep included deep vein thrombosis, pressure sores, infection and paralysis of the gut, all of which could be fatal. Though the disproportionate number of female patients under his care was not, in itself, evidence of misogyny, his treatment of particular individuals locates him firmly within that psychiatric tradition. He was perfectly willing, for example, to regard female independence as synonymous with madness and in need of social correction. One young woman was dispatched to Sargant by her wealthy businessman father after she fell in love with an “unsuitable” man in the 1960s. Sargant “helped” the situation by subjecting her to months of narcosis, ECT, antipsychotics, antidepressants and the “truth drug”, sodium amytal, after which she was successfully returned to her family with all memories of her boyfriend completely erased. Obedience had been achieved through physical obliteration of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While there is no denying Sargant’s lack of medical ethics, and his authoritarianism and reliance on dogma as opposed to clinical evidence, &lt;em&gt;The Sleep Room&lt;/em&gt; can present him as almost cartoonishly villainous. With eyes “like washed black pebbles”, “sadomasochistic stubbornness” and a “prodigious enthusiasm for pill popping”, he sweeps the wards like a demented demigod, barking orders to terrified staff and patients alike. This portrayal unhelpfully flattens very real and complicated issues over how best to treat serious mental illness. Patient consent – the bedrock of all good medical practice – cannot always be obtained when a patient’s illness means they lack capacity to make decisions for themselves. Even today, with a modern emphasis on the rights of patients, the responsibilities of clinicians and the need for humanity in psychiatry, enforced treatment is sometimes the only way to prevent a severely unwell psychiatric patient harming or killing themselves. ECT, for example, although used much less frequently than in Sargant’s day (and rightly so), can be a life-saving last resort, as in patients with catatonic depression. With more nuance and less condemnation, Stock could have interrogated more richly the complexities of how best to treat disabling and life-threatening psychiatric illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel Clarke’s most recent book, &lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-story-of-a-heart-9780349145594/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Story of a Heart&lt;/a&gt; (Abacus)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;has been shortlisted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women’s prize for nonfiction 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxQaTNKWFd6dlhjamFwRFZpTWx4ZlVteHV5UnJhdXM2WXBqYkRNN1NOMDNUa040NWFrM1dJSTR1RTdvcVJZRTJHaFU5bmZTUzBlMzZBcEpYakNFVW5mRkcyXzNpZmh0cDd1dmxiZEVGLURjUXhtOXVQVGI4WC02X0tTNUV5WW1OZUhxS2JuUjMtMFZoWGpwR0RJQlpWMDFIQ0t1VnJLSVNuOGliTlVnOFNvTUFVdmRBOUIzdk1ZWGtBZnRNSUdsYTB6YzBGS050T0hVaFRleGpsZm5ET3FPcTlRR0FZeXJQUzQxeUlPNTdaTzdUcUhzbXc</guid></item><item><title>7 health benefits of eating 3 dates and 5 almonds every morning - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine starting the day with a simple ritual: the sweet, chewy 3 dates and the crunchy five almonds.

Hours later, with Brandes drifting in and out of consciousness, Meiwes ended his life by stabbing him in the throat. Over the next 10 months, Meiwes consumed approximately 20 kilograms of Brandes's flesh, storing body parts in his freezer under pizza boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meiwes was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/04/germany.lukeharding" target="_blank"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; in December 2002 after an Austrian student alerted authorities to a new advertisement from Meiwes. Upon searching Meiwes's home, police found body parts and a videotape detailing the entire event. In court, Meiwes said the crime was something he had wanted to do for a long time, adding, "I always had the fantasy and in the end I fulfilled it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was convicted of manslaughter in 2004 and sentenced to eight and a half years, but given life in prison for murder after a 2006 retrial.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers also found that the local environment plays a significant role in shaping how our ears respond to different sound frequencies. The study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that both biological and environmental factors influence human hearing more than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Patricia Balaresque at the Centre for Biodiversity and Environmental Research in Toulouse, France, in collaboration with Professor Turi King from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom. The team set out to explore a question that has been surprisingly underexamined: What shapes the diversity in human hearing beyond aging and noise exposure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most previous studies of hearing have focused on people living in industrialized countries, often assuming that any loss in hearing ability is due mainly to age, loud noise, or harmful chemicals. But those explanations don’t apply to everyone. People who haven’t been exposed to excessive noise or toxins still show different levels of hearing sensitivity. The team wanted to understand whether these differences could also be linked to biology, such as sex and age, or to external factors like language, local ecology, or population history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this, the researchers studied a wide variety of human populations. They tested 448 healthy adults from 13 distinct groups across five countries: Ecuador, England, Gabon, South Africa, and Uzbekistan. These populations were chosen to represent a broad mix of environments, from dense forests and high-altitude rural areas to urban settings. By looking at such a diverse sample, the researchers hoped to capture how both human biology and the surrounding environment might influence hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure hearing sensitivity, the team used a technique called Transient-Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions. This test doesn’t require the person to respond to sounds, which makes it ideal for comparing hearing across languages and cultures. Instead, a small device plays a clicking sound into the ear and then records the tiny sounds the inner ear sends back in response. These returning signals are created by cells in the cochlea and give a reliable indication of how sensitive the ear is to sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team recorded these signals from both ears of each participant, collecting thousands of individual profiles. They also took detailed notes on each person’s age, sex, and hearing health history, excluding anyone with known hearing problems or recent ear infections. Participants completed questionnaires about their general health and lifestyle, and researchers made sure that no one taking medications that could affect hearing was included in the final analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the data were collected, the researchers examined several features of the signals, including how strong they were (measured in decibels) and which frequencies the ear responded to most strongly. They also compared how these features varied based on a person’s sex, age, which ear was tested, their population, the type of environment they lived in, and their language group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Across all 13 populations, women had more sensitive hearing than men—by about two decibels on average. This pattern held across all tested frequencies, not just at high frequencies where earlier studies had noted differences. The researchers suggest that this may reflect a universal biological trait rather than a culturally specific pattern. They point to possible causes such as hormonal influences during development or subtle structural differences in the cochlea between sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the effect of age was present but less pronounced. People’s hearing did become less sensitive as they got older, particularly after the age of 35, but this decline was smaller than the difference observed between men and women. The left and right ears also differed slightly, with the right ear being a bit more sensitive on average—a pattern that has been seen before and may relate to how the brain processes sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most unexpected finding was the strong role of the environment. People living in different ecological settings had not only different hearing sensitivity levels but also responded best to different ranges of sound frequencies. For instance, individuals from high-altitude rural areas in the Andes had the lowest hearing sensitivity overall. This may relate to the body’s response to low oxygen or other altitude-related stressors. In contrast, people living in tropical forests had higher sensitivity, especially in frequency ranges important for detecting natural sounds, which may help in environments with dense vegetation and rich animal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urban environments also appeared to shape hearing in unique ways. People in cities had hearing profiles shifted toward higher frequencies, possibly as a response to the constant low-frequency hum of traffic and other city noise. This adaptation mirrors what has been observed in birds living in cities, which often sing at higher pitches to be heard over the background noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored whether language played a role, grouping participants by their language family (such as Indo-European or Niger-Congo). While language had some effect, it was not as strong as the influence of the physical environment, suggesting that ecological factors play a larger role in shaping hearing than cultural or linguistic differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any study, there are some limitations. The researchers did not follow individuals over time, so they couldn’t directly measure how hearing changes in response to environmental shifts. Also, while the study excluded people with known hearing damage, there may still have been unreported exposures to noise or other unknown influences. Genetic data were not analyzed, so it’s unclear whether the observed differences are inherited or are the result of adaptation during a person’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors say future research should explore whether the variations they found are due to genetic adaptation to local environments or whether they reflect flexible responses to the conditions people live in—what scientists call phenotypic plasticity. If environmental changes like noise pollution or altitude can reshape hearing, it suggests the human auditory system is more adaptable than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, King noted the broader importance of the findings: “We know that humans are continuing to evolve, so the next question is whether our hearing can change in response to different environments generally or whether there are genetic adaptations involved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Patricia Balaresque added, “Our findings challenge existing assumptions and highlight the need to consider both biological and environmental factors when studying hearing. Identifying drivers behind natural hearing variation will improve our understanding of hearing loss and individual differences in noise tolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;Sex and environment shape cochlear sensitivity in human populations worldwide&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Patricia Balaresque, Sébastien Delmotte, Franklin Delehelle, Andreia Moreira, Nancy Saenz-Oyhéréguy, Myriam Croze, Tatyana Hegay, Tamara Aripova, Sylvie Le Bomin, Philippe Mennecier, Didier Descouens, Sylvain Cussat-Blanc, Hervé Luga, Angel Guevara, Maria Eugenia D’Amato, Turi King, Catherine Mollereau, and Evelyne Heyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 18:08:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQbjRfVzBmWWlUY0xCc0ZNb2ZOWDZWUVozTU1PREk2M2JxR1ZUenFMNHliTWJFaHY4Q3otMUxyWE1pMDYxNldDR0tMQ0hqaTdDRlBlRXNkcHJHUHNnakxaM2JaUGpZeWZyQlF3MEctZWdXMVZidEJRTUFjTWNscEdmNlZaeE1SNVJOT0lDZDg0STl5TUt6bnUwdTVidUJVaV83U2ZRS1ZlOHktY21JdUpQa19NOWtXeUE</guid></item><item><title>The Average Weight for American Women - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE44UFkwZ0hOeWpGU3hXTE5HbEJBczFxZUM0eXlxeWw5MzUteUY2Z012STdDMXR6MGhkZEwzZzEzb0FNOHVNTnBZVURVWlppXzY2dHZwLU9mY0ZkMDBzekZhWDlSVF9OdUVYWTBpRWtlV2xuZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;JLco - Julia Amaral/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is the Average Weight for Women?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was reviewed by Craig Primack, MD, FACP, FAAP, FOMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for straight answers, here they are: The average weight for women in the U.S. is 170.8 pounds, and the average height is 5 feet, 3 inches tall.

We learned a lot about the often contradictory beliefs we hold about weight, including what we believe is normal for our own weight and the weight of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey found that women believe the ideal weight for women is 139 pounds. But when asked about their personal ideal weight, the answers changed. When speaking about themselves, the average goal weight for women reported by women in this study was 144 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's up with these discrepancies? According to Dr. Jessica Shepherd, chief medical officer at Hers, there are a few factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Body image is a multifaceted construct which includes positive and negative attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors," she says.

Many variables can affect our waistlines, and they can come into play at different points in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these factors include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hormones&lt;/b&gt;. Changes in estrogen and progesterone levels throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause can affect &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5850121/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolism and weight regulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolism and weight regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genetics&lt;/b&gt;. Genes can influence body composition, like where we tend to hang onto fat, and even how quickly we burn calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nutrition&lt;/b&gt;. Eating habits, the nutritional quality of our diets, and portion sizes impact weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physical activity&lt;/b&gt;. Cardio and strength training affect calorie expenditure, muscle mass, and overall body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stress&lt;/b&gt;. Chronic stress can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/guides/how-to-stop-emotional-eating" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emotional eating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emotional eating&lt;/a&gt;, hormonal imbalances, and changes in appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleep&lt;/b&gt;. Poor sleep quality can disrupt hormone levels, metabolism, and appetite regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medical conditions&lt;/b&gt;. Certain health conditions like PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), thyroid disorders, and &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/conditions/insulin-resistance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; can affect weight regulation in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medications&lt;/b&gt;. Medications like antidepressants, birth control pills, and corticosteroids may cause weight fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Social and cultural factors&lt;/b&gt;. Our eating habits are partly shaped by societal norms, cultural attitudes toward food, and peer or familial influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental health&lt;/b&gt;. Emotional well-being, self-esteem, and coping mechanisms all play a role in weight maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your age group, height, race, and ethnicity can also impact your weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Prostock-Studio/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 Tips for Healthy Weight Management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy weight management is a lifelong process. Your lifestyle habits are essential to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight and reducing your risk of weight-related health problems like &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/conditions/obesity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease. So toss the weight chart in the trash and consider these tips instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a goal to aim for, a healthcare provider can let you know what a healthy weight range would be for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Focus on Nutrients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition is one of the most important components of your overall health and wellness. Not only does a nutrient-rich diet provide the vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, and macronutrients (&lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/how-much-protein-eat-lose-weight" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, fats, and carbs) your body needs to thrive, but it also supports healthy weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat mostly whole foods&lt;/b&gt;. These include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and other lean proteins. This mix provides an array of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and they’re rich in &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/fiber-for-weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which helps you feel full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minimize ultra-processed foods&lt;/b&gt;. Examples include soda, candy, and packaged snack foods. These tend to be high in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on nutrients versus calories&lt;/b&gt;. Rather than being laser-focused on counting calories, put nutrients first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ladanifer/Istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Get Better Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting enough sleep will wreck anyone’s day, and things can go downhill fast if this is an ongoing problem. Sleep deprivation does more than just make you cranky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of sleep makes us more prone to sugar cravings and mindless eating. Experts say adults should get &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29073412/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seven to nine hours;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seven to nine hours&lt;/a&gt; of quality sleep per night. If you don’t normally sleep very well, try these tips to catch more Zzz’s:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow a consistent sleep-wake schedule, meaning you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopt a calming nighttime routine you can look forward to each evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dress in breathable PJs and use comfy bedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid screens close to bedtime, as the blue light can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9424753/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interfere with melatonin production;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;interfere with melatonin production&lt;/a&gt; and make it harder to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use black-out curtains or a white noise machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you have &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/conditions/sleep-apnea" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;JLco - Julia Amaral/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Move Your Body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is important for supporting your overall health and achieving your weight goals. Regular exercise helps you burn extra calories, lose weight, and put on muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For general health, experts recommend at least &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:150 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;150 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise weekly, plus strength training twice per week. For weight loss goals, this increases to 200 to 300 minutes per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/steps-a-day-lose-weight" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:getting your steps in;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;getting your steps in&lt;/a&gt;, here are a few things to try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swimming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jogging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing martial arts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing basketball&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining a group fitness class&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interval training (HIIT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using resistance bands, dumbbells, or weight machines, or doing bodyweight exercises&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;KucherAV/ iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Consider Weight Loss Medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When daily lifestyle habits alone aren’t enough to promote weight loss, many people find success with &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/weight-loss-medication" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss medications&lt;/a&gt;. Intended to be used alongside a healthy diet and exercise, some of the most popular and effective weight loss medications include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists&lt;/b&gt;. These work by mimicking the effects of the naturally occurring hormone GLP-1, which regulates appetite and food intake. By activating GLP-1 receptors in your brain, GLP-1s help promote fullness, slow digestion, and decrease cravings. Examples include liraglutide (Saxenda) and &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/weight-loss/compounded-semaglutide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:semaglutide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; (Wegovy or Ozempic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metformin&lt;/b&gt;. Metformin is primarily used to improve blood sugar regulation in those with type 2 diabetes, but it may also support weight loss by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6520185/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:decreasing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;decreasing&lt;/a&gt; appetite and reducing the absorption of glucose from food in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contrave&lt;/b&gt;. This is a combination of bupropion (an antidepressant and aid to quit smoking) and naltrexone (used for alcohol and opioid dependence). Bupropion helps reduce appetite and cravings, while naltrexone counteracts the effects of certain brain chemicals involved in food reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Topiramate&lt;/b&gt;. Topiramate is often used as an antiepileptic medication, but it can support weight loss by suppressing appetite and promoting feelings of fullness. It may also influence your brain's reward pathways, potentially reducing cravings for high-calorie foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ridofranz/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Nurture Social Connections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were never meant to do life alone, and this includes the journey to achieving a healthy weight. Social connections provide support, accountability, and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37698801/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that people who have these types of networks experience better weight loss outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining a group fitness community or jogging with friends builds a sense of community and encouragement, making it easier to stay committed to &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/healthy-eating-habits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy habits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a strong social network can help provide outlets for healthier stress management. It’s also a place to share experiences, successes, and challenges with those on similar journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Kateryna Onyshchuk/Istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Drink More Water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay hydrated, primarily with plain water. &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/drinking-water-weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; is essential for health, but it also helps keep you fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to sip on water throughout the day to keep cravings at bay. If your goal is weight loss, drink water right before or during meals to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4901052/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:help promote fullness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;help promote fullness&lt;/a&gt; and prevent overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get tired of plain water, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ridofranz/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding the Healthiest Weight for You&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summing it up, the average weight for women in the U.S. is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:170.8 pounds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;170.8 pounds&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn’t mean this is the ideal weight for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there’s no “ideal” weight calculation that considers every woman’s body type or health requirements. And at the end of the day, health is more than a number on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While unrealistic beauty standards and societal pressures are pervasive, that doesn’t mean we have to accept them as the norm when examining the optimal weight range for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re on a mission to find the healthiest weight for you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritize healthy everyday habits&lt;/b&gt;. This means improving sleep, staying hydrated, nourishing your social connections, boosting your nutrition, and moving your body regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seek outside support&lt;/b&gt;. Friends and family can be excellent support systems, but sometimes professional health experts can offer invaluable guidance. Perhaps it makes sense for you to talk to a dietitian or connect with one of our licensed healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on you.&lt;/b&gt; Weight management is personal. What’s most important is understanding your body and the best weight range for you personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/guides/emotional-balance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emotional Balance: Practical Tips For Uncertain Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Emotional Balance: Practical Tips For Uncertain Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/healthy-chicken-salad-recipe" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Recipe: Healthy Chicken Salad;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Recipe: Healthy Chicken Salad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/average-weight-for-women" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Forhers.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Forhers.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and was syndicated by &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediafeed.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MediaFeed.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;MediaFeed.org&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 16:52:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE44UFkwZ0hOeWpGU3hXTE5HbEJBczFxZUM0eXlxeWw5MzUteUY2Z012STdDMXR6MGhkZEwzZzEzb0FNOHVNTnBZVURVWlppXzY2dHZwLU9mY0ZkMDBzekZhWDlSVF9OdUVYWTBpRWtlV2xuZw</guid></item><item><title>Texas Measles Outbreak Hits 400 Cases - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQLU9JTzd5RnRKdEx0dkhxVE1LYUlQSTJBWm9vZWR2N1BHZ0J5aDM3MDQzMmRSYkphR3BLdG1URVRpVmEzVVlhdlF2RThBQk5UMW56dEFNWHpFZVhlc3ZmNFc5akFTUk1uZFRid09jZ3Y1Tm9XTnlkeW5Sa3hYejJXM2dGd2JBdGVZWWVsZ21PQ2k4T3Z0dk12Qndla9IBoAFBVV95cUxOeGJfWE5fWHJpUEpUaHJwMnhhODZJbmR4ZTFTYmZJdzY2VHNCcFhYcFRfT3V4WXpaeDFWdmJ4a1JGdTdCM2lza2pQQm1PeFFFemp2aTQxa2NFRkY0T0dWU1UxZ2pPQXMybUZOOWsySk5RYTRlTkd1ZFc5SzBVMjFXMHJzenJPRjdyLVo3S3BNWjZYUGcyS3FQRFR4bDVfNVB3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

They also tend to have lower rates of high blood pressure and experience less physical pain. These findings come from a new population-based study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/22423982.2024.2419698" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;International Journal of Circumpolar Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which compared people who sauna bathe regularly with those who do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most earlier findings on sauna use and health have been based on Finnish populations, where sauna bathing is deeply embedded in the culture. While northern Sweden also has a strong tradition of sauna use, little was known about how sauna habits relate to health in this population. The researchers wanted to understand whether regular sauna use was associated with measurable differences in physical and mental health and whether these associations held true outside of Finland. To do this, the research team used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.umu.se/en/research/infrastructure/norra-sveriges-monica-studie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2022 Northern Sweden MONICA study&lt;/a&gt;, a long-running health survey designed to monitor cardiovascular risk factors in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have done a lot of research on nursing in emergency and intensive care, but in recent years, I have developed a growing interest in health and nature,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.ltu.se/en/staff/a/asa-engstrom#h-Aboutme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Åsa Engström&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the Luleå University of Technology. “In connection with that, I have read about the benefits of sauna bathing, such as its positive effects on cardiovascular health. We then had the opportunity to include questions about sauna bathing habits in the Northern Sweden MONICA Study, which allowed us to compare various health parameters between those who used saunas and those who did not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2022, a random sample of 1,180 adults aged 25 to 74 from the northern counties of Norrbotten and Västerbotten were invited to participate. Of these, 971 people (about 82 percent) answered questions about their sauna habits. Participants who reported sauna bathing at least once per month were categorized as “sauna bathers,” a group that made up 66 percent of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey collected a wide range of information, including demographic details, health status, lifestyle habits, and mental well-being. It also included specific questions about sauna use, such as how often participants used a sauna, how long they stayed in, the temperature of the sauna, and whether they bathed alone or with others. Other questions assessed participants’ levels of physical activity, smoking and drinking habits, sleep satisfaction, and experience of pain, anxiety, and depression. Participants also rated their general health, energy levels, and happiness on standard scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed several significant differences between people who used saunas regularly and those who did not. Sauna bathers were generally younger, more often male, and more likely to be physically active. They also smoked less, although they tended to drink alcohol more frequently—typically two to three times per week. Despite this, they reported better overall health. Compared to non-sauna bathers, they had lower rates of diagnosed high blood pressure and reported experiencing less physical pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health outcomes also differed between the two groups. Sauna bathers reported lower levels of anxiety and depression, and higher levels of energy and happiness. They also expressed greater satisfaction with their sleep patterns. Interestingly, these benefits were most noticeable among those who sauna bathed one to four times per month. Bathing more frequently than that did not lead to additional improvements in mental health or energy, and happiness scores were actually lower among those who used the sauna more than four times per month compared to moderate users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of sauna users in the study followed fairly typical sauna routines. Most stayed in the sauna for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, usually in one or two bouts per session. The temperature ranged between 60 and 80 degrees Celsius for most users, and electric saunas were the most common type. Most people bathed with others rather than alone, but relatively few combined sauna use with cold-water or ice swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the association between sauna use and better health was not strongly tied to socioeconomic status. Sauna bathers and non-sauna bathers did not differ significantly in terms of education or where they lived. This suggests that the benefits seen among sauna bathers may not be explained solely by financial resources or living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these results are consistent with previous studies suggesting health benefits from sauna use, the researchers caution that the study has limitations. One key limitation is its cross-sectional design, which means the data were collected at a single point in time. This makes it impossible to say whether sauna use causes better health, or whether healthier people are simply more likely to use saunas. Long-term studies or clinical trials would be needed to determine whether sauna use directly leads to health improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the group of sauna users tended to be younger and included more men, which may have influenced the results. Age and gender can both affect health outcomes independently of sauna use. Although the researchers compared groups statistically, more detailed analysis adjusting for these factors would be needed in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have begun analyzing more of the parameters in the MONICA data,” Engström said. “Our aim is to better understand the health effects of sauna bathing and how factors such as the environment and social context influence the experience. We have now developed a new survey on sauna bathing to help answer our research questions, and so far we have received nearly 400 responses. I am also conducting interviews with people, not only about sauna bathing but also about cold baths and winter bathing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/22423982.2024.2419698" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sauna bathing in northern Sweden: results from the MONICA study 2022&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Åsa Engström, Hans Hägglund, Earric Lee, Maria Wennberg, Stefan Söderberg, and Maria Andersson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 16:05:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQSzg4M1UzMzc3dC1oTlhmelBRYTV1dGZsY3k5NG9WNnFudV8xbzA4SWotRWFTNTJpTFdPR0NON2pWVGFNVVBValRsb1gyY0RCaEZjWHUxWXRKbmF4T1pDbWVWeldzWXlKM29qSndNWnBneGtBVWdxQXVteE5jT2IxMVI4YU5tc3pXTWJCYTBScFRubGVJendoS00yaHZjN21R</guid></item><item><title>This deadly, drug-resistant fungus is spreading.

Over time, my interest in the role of nutrition on sports performance and overall health grew, leading me to my current role as a dietitian. Instead of laminating pastry dough and frosting cakes, I’ve been able to merge my passions by creating desserts with benefits—aka sweet treats packed with nutrient-dense ingredients.  But let’s be real: Life gets busy, and I don’t always have time to whip up desserts and snacks. That’s why I’ve been hooked on &lt;a href="https://www.naturaldelights.com/products/cacao-pecan-mini-medjools" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found right in the produce aisle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brownie-inspired date bites bring just the right combination of flavors and textures to the table: sweet, chocolaty, caramel-like, nutty, chewy and crunchy.  Craving a candy bar? The combination of a dense, chewy, caramel-like texture, rich, chocolaty flavor and satisfying crunch is sure to do the trick. Plus, this snack is made from just four simple ingredients and is free from added sugar and artificial additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hungry yet?  Join me as I dive into why this high-fiber, dessert-like snack is one that I never leave the grocery store without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Natural Delights Cacoa Pecan Mini Medjools Is a Great High-Fiber Snack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon. EatingWell design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s Filling and Satisfying&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to filling power, some snacks just don’t cut it. But that’s not the case with these Mini Medjools. Each bite-size piece packs a trio of nutrients—complex carbs, protein and fiber—that work together to keep you full for longer and truly satisfied. Specifically, each four-piece serving provides 24 grams of carbohydrates, 5 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s Blood Sugar–Friendly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snack’s combination of fiber and protein also helps to slow digestion, providing a steady release of sugar without causing large swings in your blood sugar levels. While you might worry that dates are off-limits if you have diabetes, they’re actually an incredibly nutrient-dense way to add sweetness without using added sugars. Plus, one review found that eating dates may actually help lower blood sugar levels, thanks to their high fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s High in Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, this chewy snack is packed with an impressive 5 grams of fiber per four-piece serving. In addition to minimizing blood sugar spikes and increasing satiety, fiber plays an important role in heart and digestive health. Specifically, dates are high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insoluble fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which helps prevent constipation and may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It Provides Several Essential Nutrients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to fiber, these brownie-inspired bites contain numerous other important nutrients, largely thanks to their three main ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medjool dates &lt;/strong&gt;are a sweet source of complex carbohydrates, fiber and micronutrients like potassium, magnesium, folate, copper, calcium and iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pecans &lt;/strong&gt;are often overlooked except during the holidays (hello, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/276928/mini-pecan-pies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pecan pie!;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;pecan pie!&lt;/a&gt;). However, these buttery nuts provide heart-healthy unsaturated fats, fiber, plant-based protein and a wealth of micronutrients like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-consume-vitamin-e-regularly-8685814" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin E;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, copper and zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cacao powder and nibs &lt;/strong&gt;are packed with antioxidants, specifically flavonols, which protect against cell damage and support heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cacoa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cacoa&lt;/a&gt; also contains fiber and micronutrients like magnesium and potassium.,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It Has Benefits for Your Heart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fiber-rich snack isn’t just good for digestion, it’s also good for your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8700225" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;.

For example, one study found that adults at risk for heart disease who swapped their usual snacks with pecans for 12 weeks saw meaningful reductions in cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Meanwhile, cacao’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flavonoid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flavonoid&lt;/a&gt; content may help reduce chronic inflammation, lower triglyceride levels and improve blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Choose a High-Fiber Snack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snack time is a great opportunity to increase the amount of fiber in your diet; the key is knowing what to look for. Here are a few tips for choosing a nutritious, high-fiber snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for 3 grams of fiber per serving or more&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifically, look for snacks containing at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. While some snacks are fortified, others contain natural fiber sources, like fruits, veggies, lentils, nuts, seeds and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit added sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;Ideally, look for snacks that are naturally sweetened with fruit and limit those containing high amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912011/whats-the-big-deal-about-sugar-we-have-your-questions-answered/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:added sugar.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;added sugar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to the ingredient list: &lt;/strong&gt;In general, snacks with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-fiber-snack-recipes-with-3-ingredients-or-less-8725256" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:short, simple ingredient lists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;short, simple ingredient lists&lt;/a&gt; are less likely to contain artificial additives or preservatives. They often tend to be lower in added sugar and unhealthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose whole grains: &lt;/strong&gt;Whole grain–based snacks are typically higher in fiber and other essential nutrients than their refined counterparts. Whole-grain crackers, oat-based granola bars and popcorn are all great &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898414/what-are-whole-grains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:whole-grain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;whole-grain&lt;/a&gt; options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include protein&lt;/strong&gt;: The combination of protein and fiber can be especially helpful for satiety and managing blood sugar levels. Nuts, seeds, nut butters, trail mixes, edamame, roasted chickpeas and hummus are all great examples of foods offering this beneficial duo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for fruit- or vegetable-based options:&lt;/strong&gt; Fruits and vegetables are important sources of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Look for snacks that incorporate them in any form—fresh, frozen, dried or canned. For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8034765/a-month-of-veggie-packed-smoothies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt; is a refreshing way to add a dose of both fruit and leafy greens, while fruit leathers and dehydrated veggie chips are good for taking on the go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you’re in the produce department, don’t forget to grab a container of Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools. Packed with fiber and with a wonderfully chewy consistency, this snack offers numerous health benefits in a small, yet satisfying package.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitian-favorite-high-fiber-snack-11696280" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 15:05:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE01WTZnclAzZFoyaDlhMU5fcC1sWEpoNGhpZDJ6MEg0VWRnZHpHM2NWeW44VWFYbWdUQjU4eV9TUGVmdWNRcVVXY2tkZFhpektpRWRUNHFuVVFFUnZIaVdvN2dIZlhId0xrSW5OR094ZU8</guid></item><item><title>Cutting carbs can be healthy.

Even the healthiest of diets like the &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/goodbye-excess-salt-dash-diet-090810042.html" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; recommends limiting sodium intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some dietary exclusions make more sense than others, a few foods seem to be recommended against especially often. One of the most targeted nutrients of many of the most popular diets is carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are carbs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates, commonly called carbs, are the sugars in specific foods. The are important because they are the body's main source of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of carbs: simple and complex. Simple carbs are natural, digestible sugars such as ones found in foods like milk (lactose), table sugar (sucrose) and fruit (fructose). Complex carbs are starches and the fibrous parts of food that the body doesn't digest. Complex carbs are commonly found in starchy vegetables like potatoes and corn or processed grains like rice, bread, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cereal-good-watch-added-sugars-090401730.html" data-ylk="slk:cereals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;cereals&lt;/a&gt; and pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both simple and complex carbs are broken down by the body into glucose, which gets transported to cells, muscle and organs to provide energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red meat: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/americans-consume-lot-red-meat-090316085.html" data-ylk="slk:Americans consume a lot of it.

Here's why we shouldn't.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a low-carb diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low-carb diet aims to limit the amount of carbohydrates you eat. Most healthy adults eat between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day, but low-carb diets recommend significantly reducing this amount to no more than 130 grams daily. "Some are restricted to as low as 20 to 60 grams of carbohydrates per day," says Leslie Bonci, a sports dietitian for the &lt;a href="https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/teams/kansas-city-chiefs/339" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kansas City Chiefs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; and founder of &lt;a href="https://activeeatingadvice.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Active Eating Advice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Active Eating Advice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such restrictions occur by cutting down on candy and sugary drinks, starchy vegetables and processed grains. A food's "Total Carbohydrates" are listed on its &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/reading-nutrition-labels-improve-overall-091227405.html" data-ylk="slk:Nutrition Facts label;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;Nutrition Facts label&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/reading-nutrition-labels-improve-overall-091227405.html" data-ylk="slk:.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieters are encouraged to replace high-carb foods with low-carb alternatives such as chicken, seafood and lean beef, plus fruits like apricots, oranges, avocados, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/know-raspberries-yes-theyre-good-090053138.html" data-ylk="slk:raspberries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;raspberries&lt;/a&gt; and lemons. Vegetables like broccoli, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, kale and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/yes-asparagus-good-heres-why-090121497.html" data-ylk="slk:asparagus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;asparagus&lt;/a&gt; are also included in most low-carb diets—as are eggs, cheese, Greek yogurt and nuts like walnuts, peanuts, macadamia nuts and pistachios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The focus of a low-carb diet is on &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/building-muscle-requires-higher-protein-100105255.html" data-ylk="slk:eating more protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;eating more protein&lt;/a&gt; and fat for nutrients and energy instead of high-carb foods," says &lt;a href="https://drlisayoung.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Young;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lisa Young&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist, author of "Finally Full, Finally Slim" and an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most common low-carb diets include the ketogenic (keto) diet, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/pros-cons-paleo-diet-experts-100031475.html" data-ylk="slk:the Paleo diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;the Paleo diet&lt;/a&gt;, the South Beach diet, the Dukan diet and the Atkins diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good question: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/yes-asparagus-good-heres-why-090121497.html" data-ylk="slk:Yes, asparagus is good for you.

But here's why you should avoid overconsumption.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are low-carb diets good or bad for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most diets, there are advantages and disadvantages of low-carb dieting. Some of the benefits include decreased risk of certain mental and physical health conditions, improved blood pressure and reduced calorie intake—which can help with weight loss. Young says that low-carb diets can also be helpful for &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/glucose-levels-important-manage-heres-101528912.html" data-ylk="slk:blood sugar regulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;blood sugar regulation&lt;/a&gt; as they recommend foods low on the glycemic index and they usually provide lowered triglycerides—a type of fat in the blood that can increase your risk for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on higher amounts of fat and protein "may also result in feeling fuller for longer and less hungry between meals," says Bonci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But low-carb diets can also be disadvantageous by being "hard to sustain and may unnecessarily restrict nutrient-dense foods like fruits, beans and whole grains," says Young. Such foods, she says, "are essential for everyday gut health, heart health and overall well-being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longterm adherence to stricter low-carb diets, Young adds, can also "lead to increased cholesterol levels from excessive saturated fat and nutritional deficiencies." Low-carb diets have also been clinically associated with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/05/04/constipation-vibrating-capsule/8513473/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:constipation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt; (due to the lack of fiber), moodiness and increased risk of kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonci points out that low-carb diets can also be pricey, "as typically carbohydrate-containing foods are less expensive than protein food," she says. Some brand name low-carb diets—especially ones with designated meal plans—can get costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, "being mindful of excessive carbs is smart, but balance is key as overly restrictive diets can backfire," cautions Young. "A sustainable, healthy diet includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods in balanced portions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/03/29/what-is-a-low-carb-diet/82560369007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What is a low carb diet?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What is a low carb diet?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 14:37:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9SdGFjUlNmbm93dWdqWUs2SFlXRkJNUUFIOHJHbHVFeEVNUllhOTllSm10dG5iN3c3WUsza2hHZjhod05iOWplYzUweURPOV9qSExxZW1qb1JIRzJrVlFfSTJ1RVhLY2RtVFNNblhtRnV1cEVKd0hBOWk2dw</guid></item></channel></rss>
