The 33-year-old began using it after a "traumatic year" in 2024. Her son was born prematurely, and as a result of stress, the mother-of-three says her skin took a "huge hit".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She uses marine collagen, the type derived from fish, in a tropical-flavoured gel she drinks every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"My skin definitely seems to be brighter and clearer, plus my hair has never looked better since I started taking it," Kimberlie says. "As a sleep deprived mother, it's definitely made a difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Emma Wedgeworth, a consultant dermatologist based on London's Harley Street, says while there is some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05679" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;research to suggest taking collagen orally has an impact&lt;/a&gt;, she remains sceptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She says the idea that collagen can make its journey through our body - not the easiest of quests - and land exactly where we need it to be is probably wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For a start, it has to get through the gut without being completely broken down. Collagen is a large molecule so companies have now started to break it up into smaller pieces - collagen peptides - otherwise known as hydrolysed collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Even though this collagen - now in its smaller form - has a better chance of making its way through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, it still has a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It has to reach the skin to have an impact, and it could just as easily slip off to support other organs in the body. It's a valuable resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"There is little reliable evidence on this, but there is a theory that because our skin is the organ with the 'fastest turnover' of cells, it might be more likely to use these collagen peptides above other organs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And that's when you might get an increase in collagen being made in the skin cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;'You can't risk stopping'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;That all seems very complicated - and uncertain. It may leave you asking: what about using collagen creams? They're going directly onto the skin, so won't they stand more chance of getting where they need to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"No," is Ms Wedgworth's simple answer. "The collagen will just sit on the outer layer of your skin, it won't reach the dermis - which is the middle layer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are three different types of collagen supplements: marine (from fish), bovine (from cows), and vegan. Of the three, the dermatologist recommends marine if you are taking collagen orally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This is because it contains more type 1 collagen - the most common of the five types and the one that gives structure to our skin cells, as well as playing a crucial role in the health of our bones, tendons and connective tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Vegan collagen is the least effective, says Ms Wedgeworth. Collagen is an animal-derived protein, so these products are not actually made of collagen, and instead contain a range of amino acids and vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Matthew Montgomery Ali Watson at the gym, smiling at the camera and rubbing chalk on her hands

"Yes, this one is for me and well, this one is for Tommy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;I look at the slender brown hound next me, grey whiskers poking out round his nose. He lifts an eyebrow in acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ali, a neuroanaesthetist who, by her own admission, "knows a lot about dosing", feels like now she's started taking collagen, she can't stop - and nor can she stop giving it to her dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I started taking it as a powder a couple of years ago.

And he is a bit brighter, but that might just be because the weather's got colder again and he's less hot and lethargic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ali's not completely convinced the supplement is making a difference, and it's costing her £60 a month to ensure she and Tommy get their daily dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Tommy started on collagen a few months ago to help his joints&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But she says she now can't stop dosing them both up. "That's the thing with these supplements," the 46-year-old says, "life does have its ups and downs. You might take them when you're on a down, then things pick up again - and it might have very little to do with the supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"But by that stage, you can't risk stopping."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Professor Faisal Ali, a consultant dermatologist at Mid Cheshire NHS Trust, says one of the issues consumers and clinicians face is the amount of conflicting information and conflicting interests in supplement research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;A recent, relatively small, study compared &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934325002839" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;research funded by the wellness industry&lt;/a&gt; to studies that did not have the same conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;While industry-funded studies suggested collagen supplements significantly improved skin hydration, elasticity and wrinkles, those that did not receive funding from pharmaceutical companies revealed no effect on skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Ali says industry-funded studies are not "inherently bad", it's just such a varied picture. But he says there is a lack of robust evidence to suggest oral and topical collagen have any substantial effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So if I could turn back time and start drinking and banking collagen in my 20s, would I have smoother, more youthful skin now, I ask him? Probably not, he says. It doesn't stay in the body for that long - we haven't got a collagen store cupboard that we can just dip into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Micro derma facial roller" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Microneedling makes small wounds in the skin which may trigger collagen production&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, Prof Ali believes we can potentially boost collagen output and maintain elasticity in our skin by using special techniques&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11499218/#fn-group1" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt; such as laser collagen stimulation and microneedling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This means using a number of tiny, specialist needles or a laser to make small wounds to our skin, which then encourage a repair process, triggering new collagen formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But that's not cheap.

First and foremost, for anyone who's 6 months old and above, there are zero safety concerns about the COVID vaccine. We are recommending that everyone 6 months and above get an updated COVID shot this fall to protect them as much as possible for the upcoming respiratory viral season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="47rba"&gt;There are a few groups that we are really strongly encouraging to get vaccinated: People who are above the age of 65 and anyone who is pregnant or considering being pregnant. And we're also encouraging our babies, the age group of 6 months to 24 months. Those groups in particular will benefit tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="1ik7l"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Centers for Disease Control’s Vaccine Advisory Board is recommending that people consult with their doctor before getting a coronavirus shot. That is a shift from previous federal policy that made vaccines widely available to almost all Americans older than 6 months for free and without question. What does it mean to consult with a clinician?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1tge1"&gt;Unless you have a special or unique medical situation that requires you to have further consultation with your physician, there is no need for consultation. For the COVID vaccine, specifically, I want to underline again that there has been no new data presented about any safety concerns about the COVID vaccine. Again, my recommendation and the city's recommendation, in partnership with New York State health commissioner, is that those 6 months and over should go ahead and get that vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5c4d4"&gt;I do worry that the very confusing messaging that is coming from our vaccination advisory council at the CDC, as well as the current U.S. health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are going to make people confused and concerned. We are in a position to say very, very clearly that it is recommended that New Yorkers 6 months old and above get the updated COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="cheq4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can New Yorkers get the vaccine at a pharmacy? Do they need to get a prescription for it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3p0i6"&gt;Luckily, because of action by Gov. Kathy Hochul and the executive order that she signed a couple of weeks ago, New Yorkers do not need a prescription. In fact, the New York City Health Department just relaunched our New York City health map — &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nyc.gov/health&lt;/a&gt; — with updated information about where you can get the COVID vaccine. It lists not only geographically lists any specific community you're in, it also lists by insurance. We also list a number of places where you can go if you do not have insurance or you can't afford to pay for a vaccine, a COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="5rh49"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now, this summer it seemed like a lot of people were getting sick with COVID, and according to the City Health Department COVID data, there was a steady increase of known COVID cases in August. So, if someone recently had COVID, do they still need to get a vaccine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="96eev"&gt;In recent weeks we did see a slight uptick in both emergency room visits and hospitalizations for COVID, and we still see that uptick actually for people who are very young and for people over the age of 65. So, COVID is definitely out there and circulating. The evidence suggests that if you just had COVID, it is generally recommended that you wait around three months, at least, after your episode of COVID to get the vaccine. But really you are eligible to get the vaccine really anytime after you're no longer feeling ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dcri7"&gt;And if you have more questions about that, you can certainly also talk to your primary care doctor about what the ideal timing is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="7brpi"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about insurance? Does that cover the vaccine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6u6i9"&gt;We are also very excited to be able to say that all of the insurers across New York City and New York State have agreed to make sure that the COVID vaccine is covered by health insurance. That is incredibly important because no one should have to pay for vaccines. Vaccines are safe and effective. They benefit you and your community and your family. And in many cases they are lifesaving, as we learned very clearly during the height of the emergency phase of the COVID pandemic. Unfortunately last flu season was also one of our worst flu seasons in recent history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dgfo3"&gt;RSV is also circulating. So we want there to be as few barriers as possible to people getting their respiratory viral vaccines. We do have those guarantees from insurers that those vaccines will be covered. It is right about the perfect time for everyone listening to go ahead and get out there and get your COVID flu and RSV vaccine if you're eligible for RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="6h0s7"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if somebody doesn't have insurance? What recourse do they have?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dt98g"&gt;At the City Health Department, part of what we do is, we ensure that no matter if you can pay, no matter where you live, no matter your documentation status, no matter any of those things, we want to make sure that you have access to lifesaving vaccines and healthcare. The NYC Health map lists several places here you can get these vaccines for respiratory viral season, even if you do not health insurance and are unable to pay out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="arj7s"&gt;&lt;b&gt;We've talked about the guidance from the federal government and how some people might be confused about new recommendations as it relates to vaccines. As a local city health official, how do you take what's being said from the federal government and then shape vaccine policy here in New York City?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="b6aii"&gt;This is one of our greatest challenges right now. Under normal circumstances, the federal government and the CDC are our partners in really making sure that accurate information is out there in the public. That is not the case right now, and that is incredibly challenging for us. So part of what we do and, and what we will continue to do, no matter what happens at the federal level, is push out information through our social media channels, through talking on the radio with folks like you, Sean, through videos and, and all kinds of different communication approaches to make sure that the message is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="234oc"&gt;Again, respiratory viral season is here. It’s time to get your COVID flu and RSV vaccine if you're eligible. They are safe and effective. That has not changed. And we will do our very best to make sure that those vaccines are free and accessible for everyone who's ready to get them, especially for the groups that are at highest risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="eofnh"&gt;&lt;b&gt;That's New York City Health Commissioner, Dr. Michelle Morse. Commissioner, as always, thanks for joining us.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dtqe5"&gt;Thanks for having me, Sean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 20:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPY3JtMThCM0JNY2M1TVZWS3V0aVdYLTZrZFMwRnJIZ3Q1c2JvbUhpcmtodE1nT1BQOEVQNFpGejNQWlRwWlRHWHVYRDZfUG1qZGZXT1BleXl3RUFBSzFWc0s2aXFuMU9kNzloeTNSYXNsUldyM0h1NUpIVGt0b2FkcHJMNi1ZSFk</guid></item><item><title>睡眠障碍预测未来几年的帕金森氏症或痴呆症-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-disorders-parkinsons-dementia-29744/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Two landmark international studies show that brain biomarkers can predict whether people with REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) will develop Parkinson’s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). MRI scans revealed that reduced glymphatic system function signals higher risk for Parkinson’s, while increased free water in the basal nucleus of Meynert predicts progression to DLB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings come from the largest imaging studies ever conducted in patients with confirmed iRBD. The results pave the way for earlier diagnosis, targeted monitoring, and preventive treatments before irreversible brain damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson’s Predictor:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduced glymphatic fluid circulation doubled Parkinson’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DLB Predictor:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher free water in the basal nucleus of Meynert raised DLB risk 8-fold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; First tools to differentiate disease outcomes years before symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An international research team led by Université de Montréal medical professor Shady Rahayel has made a major breakthrough in predicting neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to two complementary UdeM studies, scientists are now able to determine, years in advance, which individuals with a particular sleep disorder will develop Parkinson’s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies focus on isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD)—a condition in which people yell, thrash, or act out their dreams, sometimes violently enough to injure a bed partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just restless sleep—it’s a neurological warning sign,” said Rahayel, a neuropsychologist and researcher at the Centre for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine at Sacré-Cœur Hospital in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 90 per cent of people with this sleep disorder will go on to eventually develop Parkinson’s disease or DLB. Until now, however, it was impossible to know which disease would occur—or when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First biomarker: predicting Parkinson’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first study, led by UdeM doctoral student in neurosciences Violette Ayral and published in &lt;em&gt;Neurology &lt;/em&gt;on September 16, involved 428 participants from five countries: Canada, the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Czechia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It examined the brain’s glymphatic system—a network that clears metabolic waste during sleep, including proteins linked to neurodegeneration. When this system is impaired, waste accumulates, potentially triggering diseases like Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an advanced MRI technique known as DTI-ALPS, researchers measured fluid circulation in specific brain regions in 250 patients with iRBD and 178 healthy control subjects, with an average follow-up of six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key finding: patients with a lower DTI-ALPS index in the left hemisphere of the brain (indicating reduced fluid circulation) were 2.4 times more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease in the years that followed. No such link was found for dementia with Lewy bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This asymmetry mirrors what we see clinically in early Parkinson’s, where motor symptoms often start on one side of the body – it may mark the very earliest stage of the disease,” said Ayral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first evidence that glymphatic function, as measured by MRI, can predict progression to Parkinson’s—and the largest international study ever conducted on this topic among patients with polysomnography-confirmed REM sleep disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second biomarker: predicting DLB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study, led by UdeM doctoral student in neuropsychology Celine Haddad and published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt; on September 19, focused on 438 participants from the same five countries as the first study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a different approach to predict the onset of DLB —a condition combining Parkinsonian symptoms (tremors, rigidity) and Alzheimer-like symptoms (cognitive impairment, confusion, hallucinations). It’s the second most common degenerative dementia after Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured the amount of “free water” — water not bound by brain cells and able to flow freely between them — in the basal nucleus of Meynert, a key region for thought and reasoning. This free water is a sign of early microscopic changes, such as inflammation or cell loss, and serves as an indirect marker of neuronal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a median follow-up of 8.4 years, the results were striking: individuals who developed DLB had significantly higher levels of free water in this brain region, making them eight times more likely to convert to this form of dementia. This method proved more sensitive than traditional approaches based on brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s fascinating is that this marker picks up very early changes—even before symptoms emerge,” said Haddad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward precision medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies represent the largest international imaging research ever done on patients with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD, and pave the way for personalized screening tests to predict which disease will develop before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians will be able to tailor medical monitoring to each patient’s trajectory and better target clinical trials for preventive treatments, the researchers say, adding that their early intervention model could transform care for neurodegenerative diseases by addressing them before irreversible damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already knew that isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder is a warning sign for these diseases,” said Rahayel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we didn’t know was who would develop what. Thanks to these complementary studies, we now have tools to better predict and personalize care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#412b6f222e33252420346c26203b20282d2d2401342c2e2f353324202d6f2220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julie Gazaille&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umontreal.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julie Gazaille – University of Montreal&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DTI-ALPS associates with differential phenoconversion in patients with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder: a multicenter MRI study&lt;/a&gt;” by Shady Rahayel et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DTI-ALPS associates with differential phenoconversion in patients with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder: a multicenter MRI study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is the strongest prodromal marker of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Identifying brain biomarkers that predict progression and distinguish phenoconversion trajectories remains a challenge. The glymphatic system is involved in interstitial waste clearance, and its dysfunction has been associated with pathologic protein accumulation and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) has been proposed as a noninvasive proxy for glymphatic function. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with iRBD show a reduced DTI-ALPS index compared with controls and whether a lower DTI-ALPS index predicts future phenoconversion to PD or DLB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal, multicenter cohort study using brain MRI scans from patients with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD and healthy controls recruited across 5 international centers. All participants underwent T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI. DTI-ALPS indices were computed from diffusivity along projection and associative fibers adjacent to the lateral ventricles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was time to phenoconversion to synucleinopathy. Linear models assessed baseline group differences and clinical correlates, and Cox proportional hazard models assessed the predictive value of DTI-ALPS for time to phenoconversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 250 patients with iRBD (mean age: 66.5 ± 6.8 years; 87% male) and 178 controls (65.7 ± 6.8 years; 81% male) were included. Patients with iRBD showed a lower left DTI-ALPS index compared with controls (mean difference = −0.034, 95% CI −0.067 to −0.001; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.043). Of 224 patients with iRBD followed for a mean of 6.1 ± 3.5 years, 65 phenoconverted to a synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Converters had a lower left DTI-ALPS index than nonconverters (mean difference = −0.050, 95% CI −0.098 to −0.003; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.038). Lower left DTI-ALPS index was associated with an increased risk of conversion to PD over time (hazard ratio = 2.43, 95% CI 1.13–5.25; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012). Other diffusion metrics inside periventricular masks, namely fractional anisotropy, diffusivity metrics, and free water, did not differ between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with iRBD exhibit a reduced DTI-ALPS index, suggesting altered glymphatic function. This reduction was associated with future phenoconversion to PD, supporting the DTI-ALPS index as a potential prognostic MRI biomarker of progression in prodromal synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 19:08:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE94VlFfUzBpU0tLdm5sSXB1dkxWalNuQmRDbUVCU0ZLbzc0eTFFNDBUbkZrT1dUazN0Z2V6MmRfa09fYkJMREM2U3RHZmxtajVFRlRDVjFpeWtiSkdRVktRcmxsZTNuN3VOMWUwNTB1MmFuRjdlUmdDbHVVQQ</guid></item><item><title>慢性失眠可能引发引发痴呆症的大脑变化- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-may-spark-changes-in-the-brain-that-trigger-dementia</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Staring at the ceiling while the clock blinks 3am doesn't only sap energy for the next day. A large, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12425456/"&gt;long-running US study&lt;/a&gt; of older adults has now linked chronic insomnia to changes inside the brain that set the stage for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/dementia-283"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, from the Mayo Clinic in the US, followed 2,750 people aged 50 and over for an average of five and a half years. Every year the volunteers completed detailed memory tests and many also had brain scans that measured two telltale markers of future cognitive trouble: the buildup of amyloid plaques, and tiny spots of damage in the brain's white matter – known as white-matter hyperintensities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were classed as having chronic insomnia if their medical records contained at least two insomnia diagnoses a month apart – a definition that captured 16 percent of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-a-trait-in-speech-that-foreshadows-cognitive-decline"&gt;Scientists Identify a Trait in Speech That Foreshadows Cognitive Decline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with people who slept soundly, those with chronic insomnia experienced a faster slide in memory and thinking and were 40 percent more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment or dementia over the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team looked more closely, they saw that insomnia paired with shorter-than-usual sleep was especially harmful. These poor sleepers already performed as if they were four years older at the first assessment and showed higher levels of both amyloid plaques and white-matter damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, insomniacs who said they were sleeping more than usual, perhaps because their sleep problems had eased, had less white-matter damage than average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do both amyloid plaques and blood-vessel damage matter?  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="175187" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease isn't driven by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-024-00275-0"&gt;amyloid alone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7477392/"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; increasingly show that clogged or leaky small blood vessels also speed cognitive decline, and the two disease states can &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/13/2/218"&gt;magnify each other&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White-matter hyperintensities disrupt the wiring that carries messages between &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39611374/"&gt;brain regions&lt;/a&gt;, while amyloid gums up the neurons &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4135182/"&gt;themselves&lt;/a&gt;. Finding higher levels of both in people with chronic insomnia strengthens the idea that poor sleep may push the brain towards a double hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's models confirmed the well-known effect of carrying the ApoE4 variant; the strongest common genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's. Carriers declined more quickly than non-carriers, and the insomnia effect was large enough to be comparable to the effect of having the gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suspect ApoE4 amplifies the damage of sleepless nights by &lt;a href="https://molecularneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13024-016-0138-8"&gt;slowing the overnight clearance of amyloid&lt;/a&gt; and making blood vessels &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2247-3"&gt;more vulnerable to inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings add to a growing body of research, from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22354-2"&gt;middle-aged civil servants in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, to community studies in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2022.1037650/full"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28228567/"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, showing that how well we sleep in midlife and beyond tracks closely with how well we think later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic insomnia appears to accelerate the trajectory towards dementia, not through one pathway but several: by boosting amyloid, eroding white matter and probably raising blood pressure and blood-sugar levels too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sounds like an obvious next step, but the evidence is mixed. The Mayo Clinic researchers found no clear benefit, or harm, from the sleeping pills its participants were taking. Trials of newer drugs such as orexin blockers have hinted at reductions in Alzheimer-related proteins in spinal fluid, but these &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36897120/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; are tiny and short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, delivered in person or digitally, remains the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33164742/"&gt;gold-standard treatment&lt;/a&gt; and improves sleep in around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9802437"&gt;70% of patients&lt;/a&gt;. Whether it also protects the brain is still unproven, although &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29220627/"&gt;one small trial&lt;/a&gt; in people with mild cognitive impairment showed sharper executive function after this type of talk therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the relationship is unlikely to be as simple as "treat insomnia, avoid dementia". Poor sleep often co-exists with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="175187" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, chronic pain and sleep apnea – all of which themselves hurt the brain. Unravelling which piece of the puzzle to target, and when, will take rigorously designed long-term studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention starts early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants in Mayo Clinic study were, on average, 70 years old at the start of the study, but &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22354-2"&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that routinely sleeping less than six hours a night in your 50s is already linked to higher dementia risk two decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests prevention efforts shouldn't wait until retirement. Keeping an eye on sleep from midlife, alongside blood pressure, cholesterol and exercise, is a sensible brain-health strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleepless nights are more than a nuisance. Chronic insomnia appears to accelerate both amyloid buildup and silent blood-vessel damage, nudging the brain toward cognitive decline – especially in people who already carry the high-risk ApoE4 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good quality sleep is emerging as one of the modifiable pillars of brain health, but scientists are still working out whether fixing insomnia can truly head off dementia, and at what stage of life interventions will have the greatest payoff.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265216/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

But don’t be fooled, this isn’t just aimless noise. No, this pup is on a mission. And clearly, it has a system that works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within seconds, Mom arrives on cue like a doting room service cart, and it’s game on. The puppy dives in like it’s been wandering the desert, and milk has never existed before this moment. Siblings gather around, but it’s obvious who made the magic happen, this little summoner started the snack stampede.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part? That tiny, pitiful whine that somehow manages to sound both demanding &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; adorable. It’s not a cry for attention, it’s a call to action. And it’s working. The internet has already dubbed this pup the "Snack Siren,” “Milk Mage,” and our personal favorite: “The Chosen Chugger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the kind of video that hits all the right notes: fluffy ears, and the sheer power of a puppy who knows how to get results. Whether you're a dog lover, a parent of a similarly dramatic toddler, or just someone who appreciates a well-executed summon, this clip is guaranteed to brighten your scroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all it takes is one determined little voice to make the milk (or magic) happen. Whether you're summoning snacks, motivation, or Monday morning coffee, let this golden go-getter be your inspo: whine with purpose and believe the milk wagon will come. 🐾🍼&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. If we could bottle that puppy power, we’d never wait for snacks again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Every pack has a voice!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it’s the tiniest one that leads the charge. Whether it's a puppy calling for milk or someone speaking up for what matters, this video is a sweet reminder that &lt;em&gt;confidence isn’t about size — it’s about knowing you belong&lt;/em&gt;. So go ahead, make a little noise. You might just inspire others to speak up, too. 🐾💛&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/dogs/golden-retriever-overnight-playdate-with-4-pups-instantly-cant-hang" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Golden Retriever Has Overnight Playdate With 4 Pups and Instantly Can't Hang;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: Golden Retriever Has Overnight Playdate With 4 Pups and Instantly Can't Hang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/dogs/golden-retriever-puppy-becomes-designated-summoner-of-milk-wagon-in-cute-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade Pets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade Pets&lt;/a&gt; on Sep 27, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/dogs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dogs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dogs&lt;/a&gt; section.

But that’s a perilous decision that could jeopardize the health of infants, weaken protection against debilitating diseases and lead to outbreaks, medical experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Childhood vaccination rates are backsliding across the country, a trend professionals widely attribute to misinformation about the safety of shots. Those fears have been amplified by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy and President Donald Trump, who this week encouraged parents to break up childhood vaccinations into multiple doctors visits and postpone some altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Trump criticized the current federal recommendation schedule as a “disgrace” that overwhelms young children with shots and leads to lasting harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Overstating the risk of vaccines sows distrust overall,” said Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin. “It is very easy to scare people, and very difficult to un-scare them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientific data show that getting several vaccines at once is safe, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Combination vaccines have been used in the United States since the mid-1940s. Ignoring the long-standing federally recommended vaccine schedule for infants can have severe and lasting consequences if ignored, according to public health professionals and advocates, who say Trump’s health advice is dangerous and not grounded in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here’s what medical specialists say about delaying or postponing childhood vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What is the recommended immunization schedule?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The childhood immunization schedule is a federal recommendation for all the shots kids need as they grow and develop. It’s a carefully crafted timeline that considers when certain vaccines can best protect a child from debilitating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Babies and young children are often given several shots at the same time to reduce the amount of visits to the doctor. That process is designed to protect them as quickly as possible, and also save parents time, money and reduce trauma on the child. Some vaccines - like the one for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) - are given as a combination to reduce the number of shots administered during a single visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The CDC currently recommends parents vaccinate their child before the age of 2 against more than a dozen infectious diseases, including measles, chicken pox, hepatitis B, tetanus, whooping cough and polio. A Washington Post-KFF poll conducted this summer found that 1 in 6 parents have delayed or skipped some vaccines for their children, excluding for coronavirus or flu, and about a quarter of parents (26 percent) said the CDC recommends “too many” childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Trump’s remarks - the latest in his administration’s embrace of anti-vaccine rhetoric - come as immunization rates fall across the country and measles cases rise to their highest in over 30 years. Public health experts worry vaccination rates will decline even further under the current administration, as the president and health secretary use their platform to amplify misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In August, the Department of Health and Human Services revived a long-defunct task force that was initially created in 1986 as part of broader legislation to address childhood vaccine safety. According to HHS, the task force will make recommendations focused on developing and refining childhood vaccines that result in “fewer and less serious adverse reactions,” among other things. The task force will send its first report for Congress within two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What happens if I delay shots for myself, or children?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Delaying a shot outside the recommended schedule leaves children vulnerable to diseases when they are most at risk of getting ill, developing serious complications - or dying - if they contract it. That’s because their bodies and organs are still developing, and their immune systems aren’t yet equipped to handle certain infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There is a lot of work that goes into figuring out what the optimal scheduling timing is and when we should vaccinate,” said James Campbell, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at the University of Maryland Children’s Hospital and School of Medicine. “If you’re making up your own schedule, you don’t have backing from the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If an infant catches a vaccine-preventable disease like pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, they have a much higher risk of severe acute disease, hospitalization or death, Campbell said. Others, like hepatitis B, leave a higher risk of developing health complications later in life. That means the risk of complications are higher than the risk of serious vaccine side effects, which are extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The vaccine for human papillomavirus is recommended for children at ages 11 or 12, typically before they’re exposed to the virus through sexual activity. It’s also an age when they are most likely to generate the most amount of antibodies. The HPV vaccine has the potential to prevent more than 90 percent of cancers caused by the virus, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Do multiple vaccines at once overwhelm the immune system?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No. Vaccines don’t overwhelm the immune system, but instead help it recognize and fight specific diseases, according to medical experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccines contain antigens - or tiny parts of viruses or bacteria - that spark an immune response when introduced into the body. The amount of antigens in a vaccine is much lower than what the child would experience if exposed to the disease itself, so the shots do not induce serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Brown, the pediatrician in Texas, said that while the majority of parents choose to vaccinate their children, those rates are dropping. According to the CDC, 92.5 percent of kindergartners received their MMR vaccines last school year, with lower rates in some parts of the country. More than 95 percent of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles to achieve herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That is really scary and troublesome,” said Brown, the pediatrician in Texas. “As vaccination rates go down, you will start to see these diseases return.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2025/toxins-tech-tumors-is-modern-life-fueling-rise-cancer-millennials/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What researchers suspect may be fueling cancer among millennials;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;What researchers suspect may be fueling cancer among millennials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/09/25/drew-lynch-comedian-heart-attack-hospital/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Comedian spots man in cardiac arrest during show, finishes set at hospital;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Comedian spots man in cardiac arrest during show, finishes set at hospital &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/09/24/jimmy-kimmel-returns-late-night/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jimmy Kimmel advocates for free speech, slams FCC chair in late-night return;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Jimmy Kimmel advocates for free speech, slams FCC chair in late-night return&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 17:42:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOYWVzMi1GM004czRpUmhTX2dlR0tnLVllMmJBNGY1VGpGU2k2MGVhazloQkdHNXFDeENxQlZOdVc4cGUzajlKQ01KV2o5aGVMOWdvMEE1N0xoZmFrRU9NWkpYcWFfcms1MnhaOElhTGlYTnAwY2t3NmJoRXI4RFZwSndJZzB2Zkg2U0l6b2RFZ041MjQ</guid></item><item><title>在SUNY Oswego附近的废水中检测到麻疹的痕迹，但没有人被诊断出来- WSYR</title><link>https://www.localsyr.com/health/measles-detected-at-low-levels-in-oswego-wastewater-no-clinical-cases/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content article-body rich-text "&gt;
		
		




&lt;p&gt;OSWEGO, N.Y. (WSYR-TV) — The New York State Health Department has detected trace amounts of the measles virus at a wastewater treatment facility in the City of Oswego, the agency said Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oswego County Health Department informed Oswego Mayor Robert Corradino the infected wastewater is “from the area around the university,” meaning SUNY Oswego. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This could be someone who is prodromal, is passing through, or from the university or someone else who is on the public water system,” the county informed the mayor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="trfe2dd8" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So far, nobody in Oswego County or the surrounding areas has been detected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="trfe2dd8" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The state health department has issued an advisory for local hospitals and other medical facilities to be on the lookout for measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Used routinely after the coronavirus pandemic, testing of wastewater shows if people in the area have shed traces of viruses through their excretory system.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“This detection does not mean there is an outbreak,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said. “It is, however, a timely reminder to make sure you and your family are up to date on the MMR vaccine and to keep an eye out for symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Stanford-based company WastewaterSCAN detected the virus. The company and the state-run Wadsworth Center are testing more samples next week. While nobody has been identified so far with the measles virus, the initial positive detection implies that at least one person had measles in Oswego County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The New York State Department of Health says that in Oswego County, &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/vaccine/docs/Oswego_MMR_vaccination_report.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/vaccine/docs/Oswego_MMR_vaccination_report.pdf"&gt;about 87.8% of children under the age of 2 are vaccinated for measles&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/vaccine/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/vaccine/"&gt;the rest of the state&lt;/a&gt;, that isn’t too bad. But since measles is exceptionally contagious, that still leaves some children and even adults at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine are 97% effective against measles, the DOH says; one dose is 93% effective.&lt;/p&gt;

When we stay still, gut motility slows down, causing bloating, constipation, and discomfort.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, according to the doctor, prolonged sitting causes a ‘stagnation’ in your gut that heightens inflammation and makes you feel tired at work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He further elaborated, “The gut is not just a tube that moves food from one end to another. It's a complex system with muscles contracting in waves, nerves coordinating these movements, and bacteria aiding digestion. When we sit for too long, these muscles don't get the workout they need. If your overall activity is low, things start to stagnate, especially after a high-calorie, fat-rich, modern diet. This stagnation in the gut can trigger inflammation, slow metabolism, and make you feel lethargic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/09/27/original/breaks_1758988285253.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Walk instead of being seated if you are taking calls.

(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is the best way to protect your gut health if you have a desk job that may include long hours of sitting? Dr Senthil Ganesan highlighted the value of taking frequent breaks, drinking water, and maintaining a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said, “In addition to a daily workout at home, you should avoid sitting in one place at the office for more than 45 minutes. Even short, strategic breaks—like walking around the office or doing stretches—can help. Make a habit of standing up while taking phone calls. Drinking water regularly helps, as dehydration also slows down bowel movements and is a common cause of constipation. Many people turn to high-fibre diets to keep their intestines moving, but fibre alone can't replace movement. ”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His advice was that if you are feeling bloated at work, start moving, such as stretching or standing during calls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

I’ve met a wonderful woman my age who is smart, funny, attractive, and independent. We get along really well. There’s just one problem: Her body.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg0znrb1001o3b794ljgqe5w@published"&gt;She is severely underweight. She mainly eats protein bars and works out for several hours a day. Her arms are extremely thin, and her breastbone protrudes. It’s making intimacy difficult. I can’t seem to get past it. What do you suggest?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg0zn4nr001h3b79mk1ijkwo@published"&gt;First figure out what exactly is making intimacy difficult. Is it sheer aesthetics? Is your fear that this person is living an unhealthy lifestyle distracting you? What is the real issue here? She is a grown woman who is allowed to care for herself and her body however she sees fit. Through observations, you have made certain inferences, but if you haven’t really had conversations with her about her views on what constitutes fitness, you’re just supposing that something is awry. I’m not saying that you’re absolutely wrong, or that your concern has no place, but what could be done practically? Do you think you can enter her life, tell her that she’s doing it all wrong, and that she will submit?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="161" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg0zn4qp001i3b7944mctxgm@published"&gt;Besides, her arms were extremely thin and her breastbone protruded when you met her. At this early stage in your relationship, is the time for you to determine your attraction level and how viable this connection actually is. Doubts so soon are rarely a good sign. The bare minimum for facilitating a healthy relationship early on is acceptance: You see a person and you think, “This is someone I want in my life.” Seems like you aren’t quite there with this one. If you want to focus on her great personal qualities, maybe you table intimacy for the time being and just get to know her. Maybe at some point, she will convince you that she isn’t leaving a trail of protein bar wrappers to her death. Maybe you’ll only grow more concerned. Whatever attracted her to you in the first place is worth exploring until you find yourself too distracted to do so. Ask yourself whether you’re at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

This prevents the heart from pumping blood and oxygen to the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This led to a 'cannabis-induced cardiac arrest,' the team said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The case comes as a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14761339/heart-attack-risk-linked-cannabis.html"&gt;mountain of recent studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested cannabis use raises the risk of heart attack, stroke and coronary artery syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An unidentified woman in Georgia suffered a 'cannabis-induced cardiac arrest,' despite having no underlying heart conditions (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And cardiovascular disease, which includes cardiac arrest, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14330127/doctors-warn-silent-disease-kills-cancer-dementia.html"&gt;is America's biggest killer&lt;/a&gt;, taking nearly 1million lives every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings also come amid a 66 percent &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13920613/Alarming-rise-super-fit-slim-young-people-suffering-heart-attacks-experts-reveal-theories-surge.html"&gt;increase in heart attacks among young people&lt;/a&gt; between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are racing to find the cause of the mysterious heart attacks, but early research suggests obesity, sedentary lifestyle and Covid could be to blame, along with use of drugs like marijuana.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treating the woman, from WellStar Spalding Health System in Georgia, wrote in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/full/idArt/950077"&gt;medical journal&lt;/a&gt;: 'This case highlights a rare but critical presentation of cannabis-induced cardiac arrest in a young, previously healthy woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unlike most published reports that focus on older adults or those with underlying cardiac abnormalities, our patient had no structural heart disease, genetic predisposition, or metabolic derangement.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear exactly how much cannabis the woman consumed or how often she engaged in the habit, but doctors noted she was a 'chronic' user, which could mean several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 18million Americans report using marijuana daily or nearly every day. Cannabis use is also on the rise, largely due to recent decriminalization across the US. From 1992 to 2022, daily and near-daily use has seen a 15-fold increase.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman's doctors are unsure why exactly cannabis led to a cardiac arrest, but they noted THC can cause an increase in heart rate, which forced the heart's muscles to work harder to pump blood and deliver oxygen to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A May 2025 study published in &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14761339/heart-attack-risk-linked-cannabis.html"&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; also found that marijuana smokers had a 52 percent reduction in blood vessel function compared to those who never used the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels and regulate blood flow, released less nitric oxide in people who regularly smoked marijuana or took edibles. Nitric oxide helps blood vessels dilate and deliver vital oxygen throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This impaired function affects the blood vessels' ability to dilate, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis, heart attacks, and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the United States, marijuana is fully legal - for recreational and medicinal use - in 29 states. It is fully illegal in four states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laws in the remaining states are mixed, meaning the drug may be permitted for medicinal use, allowed only in the form of CBD oil, be decriminalized or be a combination of these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data shows that heart attack cases are on the rise in young Americans. The new study suggests marijuana could partly be to blame&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman's medical team noted that as legalization increases, doctors need to closely evaluate chronic cannabis users for potential heart issues.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They wrote: 'Recreational cannabis use is steadily increasing among both adults and youth due to expanding legalization and easy accessibility, underscoring the urgent need for greater public and clinical awareness of its potential health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This case highlights the serious cardiovascular consequences of THC.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman's heart rhythm returned to normal within a week, and she was discharged from the hospital to a nursing facility with a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The device is a vest that contains a defibrillator, which detects abnormal heart rhythms and sends an electric shock to return them back to normal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 13:17:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQbVdEbHMxcW9aUHlBUlRjYk5zUXpkbUtwWGh5a25hNGxPZlBseThqQXkwTkViRzJRUy00UEF2UEE2RTVjWmE3UnEzcFlzSGJLb1FQRFJoWEhvRENVQS1Mb0VfemxVQ095SmVaUExPV1BHQXNfMXNZQU9LMW9pLVhDYjY4VDRvTnoxNEFQRXJ1bzFRYmgzWENBYUtPenptd9IBowFBVV95cUxPcTNCWklhdEVSMFp4MUVYNGs5T05UXzhCajhyRzJ0TVp5VENoZXdMaWg1aG1SbTAxNjY4Zm54WkJuTFM4aVdhcW8xaWU0bjhQWmV4eU5HZF9Sa29wWS1EQkc0UHpZZ3lIVkU2MXZPWnM5c09nbHZjU3pZNzYzYnJYUF9mNmR0TVBsbzhfOEVvT0t4bmxZMW8xZVVpU0diUUJpQVRn</guid></item><item><title>我将香烟换成了“更健康”的电子烟，但在电子烟引发罕见肺病后几乎死亡-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15130961/swapped-smoking-vaping-healthier-death-lung-disease.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A smoker who traded cigarettes for vapes to be 'healthier' revealed how she nearly died after the devices triggered a rare lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zoe Shackleford, 29, from Strasburg, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-f9466c70-9a3d-11f0-a8e8-bdbd66cb13cf"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, first started smoking cigarettes at 18, but after four years, she switched to e-cigarettes in the belief they would be a healthier alternative to tobacco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The devices are often touted as being less toxic than traditional cigarettes and are promoted as a smoking cessation aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For nearly eight years, she used refillable vape devices. But last month, looking for more convenience, she made the switch to disposable vapes - a decision that would nearly end her life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While refillable vapes and disposable vapes may appear similar, there is a big difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With refillable vapes, e-liquids tend to be more regulated and sold by specialty shops or online, while the disposable equivalents often contain unlisted or unknown chemicals; some use synthetic nicotine or high concentrations of sweeteners, artificial flavors, or heavy metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the heating elements in refillable vapes are usually made of stainless steel or ceramic coils, while the disposable offerings often use cheaper metals (nickel, chromium, tin, lead), which can leach into the vapor being inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After finishing three disposable vapes (one vape can be equivalent to hundreds of puffs or even multiple packs of cigarettes, depending on the device) Shackleford said she saw her health quickly deteriorate and began experiencing what she initially thought was a mild cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Zoe Shackleford first started smoking cigarettes at 18 but after around four years, switched to e-cigarettes in the belief they would be a 'healthier' alternative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought it was from swimming,' she said. 'I had a sore throat. I didn't think much of it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within 48 hours, she found herself struggling to breathe, even during basic activities like changing clothes or using the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shackleford then became completely breathless while speaking, and realized something was seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On August 17, she was rushed to the hospital, where doctors found her airways were functioning at just 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I was first admitted to the hospital, I had only 50 percent of my airway open. It was completely closing off,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Doctors] said if I hadn't come that night, I probably wouldn't have made it to the hospital.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the hospital, Shackleford was tested for pneumonia, bronchitis, and sepsis - but all results came back negative. Her condition worsened despite initial treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They didn't know how to treat me. Everything they were trying wasn't working, so they kept going with the breathing treatments.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was kept in the hospital for nine days, receiving supplemental oxygen to help her breathe, steroids to open her airways, and antibiotics to combat any possible infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Upon discharge, she was referred to a lung specialist for further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following a detailed consultation, the specialist diagnosed her with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) - a rare inflammatory lung condition triggered by an immune response to inhaled substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On August 17, she went to the hospital where doctors reportedly said her airways were at 50 percent capacity and she could have died if she hadn't sought urgent medical attention &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He said that I have something called hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He said he hasn't seen this in two years,' Shackleford recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The vape that I was using had a chemical that was reacting negatively with my lungs - basically closing off my airway.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HP is caused by inhaling substances like mold, bird droppings, or chemical vapors, and it leads to severe inflammation in the tiny air sacs and airways of the lungs. Without prompt treatment, it can lead to permanent lung scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While rare - affecting just one to three people per 100,000 annually - HP is well-documented in people exposed to environmental irritants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is sometimes referred to as 'farmer's lung' because it plagues one percent of farmers, who are repeatedly exposed to mold grown on hay, straw and grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been dubbed 'bird fancier's lung' because it can be caused by breathing in particles from feathers or bird droppings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many other substances can trigger similar disease patterns. In many cases it can be very difficult to find the exact cause. The symptoms include cough, shortness of breath and sometimes fever and joint pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Shackleford's case, doctors traced the cause back to a chemical used in her disposable vape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now home and recovering, Shackleford is on asthma medication once a day and uses an inhaler twice daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm feeling a lot better, I'm not losing my breath as much,' she said. 'When I first came out of the hospital, even taking a shower exhausted me. I have trouble catching my breath sometimes but it's not as bad.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since quit vaping and smoking altogether, a decision she admits hasn't been easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a little bit of a challenge because I do miss it, but I think I miss the motion more,' she said. 'I feel like I snack more now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she's clear that no craving is worth risking her life again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you can get to a point of stopping, I would - that was one of the scariest experiences of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Honestly, it's not worth it. You only get one life. Something so simple as stopping vaping can help save it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stopping her vaping habit has also saved Shackleford money, as she would go through a $25 disposable vape every 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Zoe at first dismissed her symptoms as catching a sore throat from swimming late at night - however soon she couldn't speak without losing her breath and rushed to the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;And study published in June by University of California that tested seven flavored e-cigarettes from three of the most popular brands (ELF Bar, Flum Pebble and Esco) found the disposable vapes release more cancer-causing toxic metals than cigarettes. The above graphic shows the heavy metals in different parts of the tested disposable vapes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapes and e-cigarettes have long been marketed as a safer alternative to tobacco and a tool for quitting smoking - and in many cases, they may carry fewer immediate toxins than cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But recent studies are raising alarm bells, particularly around disposable vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 University of California study analyzed seven popular flavored disposable vapes - including ELF Bar, Flum Pebble, and Esco - and found they released more toxic heavy metals than cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the vapes tested released more lead in a single day than 20 packs of cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These metals - including lead, nickel, and chromium - come from the heating coils inside the devices, which leach into the liquid and are inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have been linked to serious health risks including cancer, asthma, and lung scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite concerns about the health consequences, vaping continues to grow in popularity, especially among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, 3.5 percent of US middle schoolers and 7.8 percent of high schoolers reported vaping in the past 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That translates to approximately 410,000 middle school and 1.21 million high school students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, adult use of e-cigarettes increased from 4.5 percent in 2019 to 6.5 percent in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shackleford's message to others is simple: don't assume vaping is harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was surprised it was the vaping because you hear stories of everybody else — until it actually happens to you,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That was one of the scariest experiences of my life. It's not worth it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 13:16:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeGUwcTNwMktUM1VSWUJKeTV5V2tkbDhzS053eUVTUHNPSEFHYk1pa3RPbVJOYmpnN2tLV2x5U01xaFBnMGo4akszdDdpZzVSUDE1b0hQcGJIakZlcnRyb1hLWmlOeF9sNVdrTWJ3TmczUVZKWVMxWWtMbjJ0Sjdfd0Z3czRUVG1NejlkaFVsam5MNnJjSnlVTFVmcWpzdV9vOVF4dzFLSERhcGl20gGyAUFVX3lxTE9TZ3FWYm5XLVJSTG1zZkJ2Q1BMRzhLT2s1b3RjMEY1dVRNMExnMUVEN043QjhnLVNadDU2NVFSTW9vN2o2cmhZREUtMV9Pc3Ewcm1uS1g1aXlZRk55UzUxMnE0VUFCai11dXZWd1hQZVdVSkxvM3JqdUUzRWFoZjY0eTVoTmJUUXI0VTZlVUhVanotbWEwemxlUnBld0I1ZmJxNUFJRjBOVF9CSEVhNmdWaUE</guid></item><item><title>研究人员详细介绍了可以防止认知能力下降的习惯- Straight Arrow News</title><link>https://san.com/cc/researchers-detail-habits-that-could-prevent-cognitive-decline/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-container-core-post-content-is-layout-b4b6c8b9 wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 7.2 million Americans are currently estimated to have Alzheimer’s disease,and experts such as those at the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38689398/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Health Institute&lt;/a&gt; say that number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060. As researchers say that indicates clinicians will face “major challenges” in coming years, they are urging people to take a closer look into the lifestyle habits that could help prevent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer’s disease have surged by more than 140%,” Dr. Charles H. Hennekens, a professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine at the Florida Atlantic University Schmidt College of Medicine, told &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250920214459.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;. “At the same time, it is estimated that up to 45% of dementia risk could be attributed to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hennekens is one of the co-authors of a &lt;a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(25)00576-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; in “The American Journal of Medicine” that details some of these, which include: physical inactivity; unhealthy diets; obesity and alcohol consumption. Also included are medical conditions like dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes and depression as well as social isolation and intellectual inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, there are “therapeutic lifestyle” changes that could help decrease cognitive decline in elderly patients that have been proven to help those with cardiovascular disease as well as other illnesses, researchers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These changes include physical activity, adhering to diets like the &lt;a href="https://diet.mayoclinic.org/us/blog/2025/comparing-dash-and-mediterranean-diets-benefits-differences-and-ideal-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean or DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, and not smoking. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Therapeutic lifestyle changes, if demonstrated to be beneficial, would have major clinical and public health implications in reducing cognitive decline in the US and worldwide,” researchers said in the commentary. “This possibility is of even greater importance given the interrelationships of cognitive decline with increasing age as well as the increasing proportion of U.S. and other populations of the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers highlighted the results of the Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle Interventions to Reduce Risk, or &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/us-pointer/home.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;POINTER&lt;/a&gt;, trial, where 2,111 men and women between 60 and 79 years old who were at high risk for cognitive decline because of risk factors were given either a “high intensity lifestyle intervention” or a self-guided program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those in the high intensity lifestyle intervention group had meetings in person, professional guidance and accountability measures, while the ones who were self-guided had educational materials and “general support.” Those in the former group, during the POINTER trial, “demonstrated statistically significant and clinically important improvements in global cognition,” particularly when it came to planning, attention and problem solving. Another trial, Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER,) had similar results. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are implications for clinical practice, public health, and government policy, as well as further research,” researchers wrote. “Clinicians will now be armed with lifestyle-based changes to reduce cognitive decline. In addition, public health practitioners may also add to their programs based on the study designs of POINTER and FINGER to maintain brain health, complementing pharmacologic approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only can these findings be beneficial from a health perspective — researchers said they also could lead to cost savings. Early attention to risk factors of dementia could reduce people’s medical and caregiving costs, as well as the “expensive costs of the newly developed pharmacologic agents,” some of which offer modest benefits but side effects including “loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue and restlessness,” researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While more research is needed, the current totality of evidence supports a clear path forward: invest in lifestyle-based strategies to protect brain health,” Hennekens said to Science Daily. “Doing so will not only benefit individuals at risk but also serve as a powerful tool for reducing national and global health care burdens related to cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Imani Dell seemed like a happy, healthy 6-year-old. She loved bedtime stories and Chuck E. Cheese. She was energetic and cheerful whether she was at school or home with her parents. In May 2024, she was two weeks away from graduating first grade, and was looking forward to a summer of spending time at the playground in her north Miami neighborhood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, her aunt noticed her eyes were crossed. Imani's mother, Johnesha Brown, thought that it might be because she spent too much time on a tablet. She tried to take Imani to their pediatrician, but found her insurance was expired. When the mother and daughter got home, Imani said she was seeing double. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was scared and so worried, like, now something serious was going on with her," Brown said. She filled out the application to renew her insurance, then called the company. They said it would take 30 days to review the paperwork. "I said 'I can't wait 30 days. My child needs to be seen right now.' And the lady who I spoke to ... She told me to take her to the hospital." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown thought her daughter would just need an eye exam, but when Imani was seen at the University of Miami Health System's emergency room, a nurse said she would need a CT scan to ensure there was nothing wrong in her brain. The test confirmed Brown's worst fears: There was a golf-ball sized tumor in her daughter's brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He came in with his head down, and he said 'Your daughter has a large mass in her head.' Everything just went down from there,'" Brown recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"I was just praying the entire time"    &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imani was transferred to the Holtz Children's Hospital, where she underwent brain surgery. Dr. Heather McCrea, the hospital's director of pediatric neurosurgery, said she had three goals with the procedure: to treat fluid build-up in Imani's brain that was caused by the tumor, to remove the mass and to study it to determine what other treatment Imani would need. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation was successful on all three fronts, McCrea said. Doctors determined the mass was a fast-growing tumor called a medulloblastoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medulloblastomas are tumors that largely occur in children and infants, said Dr. David Harter, the director of the division of pediatric neurosurgery at NYU Langone Health. There are multiple subtypes of this kind of tumor, each with its own "genetic signatures" like "different mutations or developmental pathways," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each subtype has its own symptoms and prognosis, though most forms of medulloblastoma manifest with symptoms like vomiting, headaches or crossed eyes. Medulloblastomas can also commonly cause hydrocephalus, or fluid build-up in the brain. That had caused the fluid McCrea had needed to remove from Imani's brain. The tumor's prognosis also depends on its subtype, Harter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Imani's tumor was removed, molecular classification was used to determine its subtype. Dr. Bradley Gampel, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist who treated Imani, said her tumor was "Group 4 medulloblastoma with intermediate risk." That meant she would need both chemotherapy and radiation. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classifying tumor subtypes helps doctors ensure patients are receiving proper treatment, Gampel and Harter both said. When treating pediatric patients, it's important to think of how treatment can impact a child's future, Harter said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not just enough to win the war over the tumor," Harter said. "We have to also consider the long-term effects of any therapies that we're going to give." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imani underwent 30 rounds of radiation. The process was hard on her, Brown said: She had to be sedated for the treatment, so she was always sleepy afterward. She had a burn on her head from receiving the therapy. She struggled to eat and lost weight. She had little energy and didn't want to play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was just praying the entire time, hoping that everything would go well and be okay," Brown said.

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the radiation was complete, Imani had a four-week break from treatment. Then, she received nine cycles of chemotherapy over the course of about a year. This process was easier, Brown said, though Imani did lose her hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, Imani was homeschooled, with the mother and daughter spending an hour a day going over a subject like history or math. Imani "didn't like" the homeschooling, Brown said, but it was a relief to see her energy levels begin to return.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Everything just is perfect" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imani finished treatment during the first week of August 2025, Brown said. To celebrate, the family went to the Epic Universe theme park. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-September, Imani returned to school for second grade. While she was nervous about going back to the classroom, Brown said she expected her daughter will like being with her friends and other kids much more than the homeschooling she had last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imani will regularly undergo scans to ensure her cancer isn't returning, McCrea said. Those scans will become more spread out as long as the cancer shows no signs of recurrence. Right now, Imani's scans are "looking good," McCrea said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown said things have been "amazing, amazing, amazing" since Imani finished treatment. Her renewed insurance covered the entire treatment process. Her daughter has been featured in two different research studies. Most importantly, Imani is starting to act like her old self. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My child really finished treatment, and she's going back to being her normal self again," Brown said. "I'm happy. I'm very excited. Everything just is perfect to me."&lt;/p&gt;

That means it’s not only your fatty deposits that’ll take a significant hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there is a more proven and natural way to cut weight – and that’s to maximise your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p purpleid="02f3949a-cde3-4aec-91ac-699d93ff0fab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nightmare obesity scenario&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence shows insufficient sleep doesn’t simply leave you wrestling with a cranky mood – it contributes to weight gain and heightens the risk of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a 2022 study by the Mayo Clinic, which revealed subjects who had their sleep restricted in the laboratory endured a 9 per cent increase in abdominal fat and an 11 per cent increase in visceral fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat is the belly fat buried deep within your abdominal cavity. It protects your organs, but having too much leads to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further study into sleep and weight found women who slept for five hours per night were 32 per cent more likely to experience major weight gain (defined as 33lb or more) and 15 per cent more likely to become obese, over the course of the 16-year study, compared to women who slept for seven hours or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is this, and where do hormones come into it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Optimise sleep, optimise hunger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/09/CYP_PBP_JB_-21-scaled.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-941100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The antics of cyclists, such as here at the Paris-Brest-Paris audax, often actively discourage a good night's sleep. &lt;span&gt;Joseph Branston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a clear relationship between sleep and body mass,” says sleep expert Dr Sarah Gilchrist, whose book &lt;em&gt;The Essential Guide to Women’s Sleep&lt;/em&gt; hits the shelves later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the major reasons why is that we make poor food choices, and a big driver of that is your hormones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take leptin, which is known as our ‘energy-expenditure hormone’,” Gilchrist adds. “It regulates appetite and is influenced by sleep. Reduced sleep means lower leptin levels and, in turn, greater hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then there’s ghrelin. This is called the ‘hunger hormone’ because it increases the drive to eat. Ghrelin levels increase through lack of sleep, making us feel hungrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you sleep poorly, you’ll have lower leptin and higher ghrelin levels, which will likely increase appetite and possibly explain the increased BMI [body mass index] observed with short sleep duration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A German study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sleep Research&lt;/em&gt;, showed that just one night’s broken sleep raises ghrelin levels significantly, explaining why you might have hunger cravings when you’re tired. They also showed that two nights or more of poor sleep reduces leptin levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, your appetite hormones (and mind) are scrambled through lack of sleep. That’s not great news for your weight and health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s not all – apologies, but we have further bad hormonal news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Poor sleep also lowers levels of testosterone,” says Gilchrist. “There’s clear evidence that this lowers muscle mass and increases fat mass. That’s bad enough, but that then leads to a further decrease in testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If your body mass continues to increase, this can lead to a potential sleep disorder (sleep apnoea), which further reduces sleep quality and quantity, and the cycle continues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insufficient sleep decreases levels of human growth hormone (HGH). HGH is predominantly released during deep sleep – aka slow wave sleep – but if this is low, so is HGH secretion, which isn’t great for your weight because HGH increases muscle mass and reduces fat mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also evidence that poor sleep impacts other metabolic and endocrine processes. For instance, a decreased glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity and raised evening concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s the psychological impact, too. We all know anecdotally that lack of sleep results in demotivation to undertake any activity that requires a hint of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t fully understood why this is, but research suggests it’s down to your mind determining whether it has the resources needed to complete the task, deciding whether those resources are available or accessible, and whether those resources need to be used or conserved for tasks of higher priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, sleep deprivation alters the perception of this resource distribution and makes things feel tougher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fatigue perception is highlighted further by a 1995 study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, where researchers deprived subjects of sleep for 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before and after the deprivation, the participants completed a series of physical tasks and, although they achieved the same level of physical result, the participants perceived that the workload had increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Boost sleep, lose weight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/09/GettyImages-532655194-2.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-941106"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Pro teams have put more emphasis on sleep in recent years. &lt;span&gt;Tim de Waele/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bleak, sleep-deprived picture, but one that can be brightened. Which is what we’ll do now by rebooting your sleep and hormonal levels in an effort to lose a few pounds and retain your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? Well, Gilchrist suggests that a cool, calm sleep environment, with a comfortable bed and the right temperature (around 18 to 20°C), will help, as will a sleep routine that’s as regular and consistent as it can be in your individual circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who struggle with sleep will no doubt have tried this lore of good sleep. If you have and it didn’t work, you must listen to Nick Littlehales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littlehales is a sleep expert who shot to prominence around 20 years ago after working with numerous sports teams, including Real Madrid and Manchester United in football and Team Sky in cycling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the best recovery tool we possess but, said Littlehales, these multi-million outfits were neglecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, the world’s finest sportspeople were sleeping on bespoke mattresses and toppers with portable air-conditioning units to keep the likes of Sir Bradley Wiggins at optimum sleep temperature when pursuing Tour de France glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littlehales is a proponent of breaking sleep down into several 90-minute cycles rather than seeing it as one big chunk because, he says, the end of a sleep cycle is when the body and brain find waking easiest. Awaken mid-cycle and you’ve undone much of your good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ideal is individual but you’re looking at four or five 90-minute cycles, but key is that you plan to awake at the end of the cycle because you’ll feel fresher,” Littlehales says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, say your wake time is 6.30am, aim to sleep by 11pm. That’s seven and a half hours, or five cycles. You can then adjust your sleep time if needed. If you have to be up early and can’t go to bed earlier, aim to sleep at 11pm and awake at 5am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That’s six hours, or four cycles. Conversely, if you feel you need more sleep, grab yourself an extra cycle by going to sleep at 9.30pm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of napping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/09/GettyImages-1140539003.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-941108"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Naps are a great way to catch up on missed sleep cycles. &lt;span&gt;Justin Paget/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to Littlehales’ R90 technique is to stop thinking of sleep in a monophasic way, he says. That means your sleep must come in one block. Instead, think of it as polyphasic – more than one – which is where napping comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A 30-minute nap is the ideal if you haven’t ticked off your optimum number of cycles,” says Littlehales. “The good thing is you don’t have to fall asleep; simply switching off your mind, by sitting down and simply chilling, helps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can squeeze in a 30-minute mental shutdown, aim to do it between 1pm and 3pm. That’s because of our natural mid-afternoon slump, which contrary to popular belief doesn’t derive from a big lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s down to our body temperature, which follows a distinct rhythm where it peaks in the early evening and hits a trough about two to three hours before waking up in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s also a small dip between the hours of 1pm and 3pm, which is called the post-prandial dip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A drop in body temperature will cause feelings of sleepiness,” says Littlehales, “so if you have had a bad or shortened night sleep then feelings of sleepiness during this period will be intensified in the majority of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even enjoy a ‘nappuccino’, whereby you consume a caffeinated product before you nap, so you feel even more alert after the 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is about making you more involved in ‘sleeping’ – you’re almost seeing it as a performance criteria like eating healthily and exercising – rather than simply waiting for it to happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, Littlehales is a keen proponent of what he calls MRMs, or micro reset moments, where like napping, you do very little. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My personal favourite is simply looking out of the window for a couple of minutes every hour or so,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just switch off and unwind. That’s so important to sleeping well and balancing out your hormones. Ultimately, the key is to be active regarding your sleep but not to put pressure on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I remember when I worked with world-class cyclists years ago, we encouraged them to wear nasal strips to nose breathe at night and ideally help them sleep more proficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But you don’t need the extra tools as most of them are really not proven to work. These few simple steps and redefining how you see sleep will help you kip better and help you lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BikeRadar</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5QWGJES1o2NFhMZS1nSE9Yc1l4d0xLbkJUajAtT3V3TlNVc0ZHRnU1UFNBM3dvNVk3STVTSG5HWklrUE5iMmQzWnlqTGpIWWRDNHl1M2piMkxtN0R6RGN6cHZIRVIxQ1V5MVcwbWZnM1U</guid></item><item><title>本周科学新闻：治疗亨廷顿舞蹈症的突破性疗法，以及突破物理学的快速增长的黑洞- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/science-news-this-week-a-breakthrough-cure-for-huntingtons-disease-and-a-fast-growing-black-hole-that-breaks-physics</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;

Caused by a single defective gene, the disease runs through families and appears between the ages of 30 and 50 with dementia-like symptoms that include loss of cognition and motor control. Until now, no treatments have slowed the disease's progression, and patients typically die within 10 to 25 years of it manifesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="67864f55-2d9f-469d-a393-1cca9bf1f0e3-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The new therapy introduced a new gene into cells in the two parts of the brain hit hardest by the disease to slow its progression by 75%, marking a remarkable first in the field.

"As we get older, body weight alone tends to be best. I also tell patients to monitor worsening pain. Muscle soreness is normal, but worsening pain in the joints is not good, as that indicates something going on inside the knee that needs to be seen by a doctor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Overall, taking the time to do knee strengthening exercises serves as a valuable investment in your long-term health. We might take our knees for granted, but they let us walk, skip, jump and run, until they fail. As Baz Luhrmann wisely advised in the song Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen): "Be kind to your knees.

Fentanyl overdoses, in particular, are expected to fall to a near 10-year low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JGIFXIBNOZD7LMXU5TKTDP3RQE"&gt;But that progress could largely be offset by an increase in cocaine deaths – again, some mixed with opioids – which is projected to kill 399 Cuyahogans by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F6JFDKF3FNEQZM22KVVM4NS46Y"&gt;“This is the problem that we’re living with now,” Gilson said of the moment. “Opiates aren’t going to go away, but if you define an epidemic as a disease that’s occurring at a higher incidence rate in the population than baseline, well, we’ve had two years of decline; so, it’s pretty hard to say, ‘I’m still living in the opioid epidemic.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The shift&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4G3IXJSF6ZANPBE2OJV57LGPTA"&gt;Opioid-related deaths, especially involving fentanyl, have been falling sharply over the last three years. Last year, overdose deaths dropped below 500 for the first time in a decade. &lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2024/12/overdose-deaths-dropped-drastically-in-cuyahoga-county-this-year-officials-cant-explain-why.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;The reason still isn’t clear.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6JOJESHUWVFBDPRJ7TEEY6J63Y"&gt;It could be that the fentanyl supply is shrinking, or that what is circulating on the street is less potent, with smaller amounts showing up in drug mixtures, Gilson said. It could also be intervention strategies and overdose reversal drugs are working to curb deaths. Gilson suspects younger generations have started shying away from the drug, after years of warnings about its lethal effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DGEMS3GN7ZFU7AIASCFGO77GLQ"&gt;Regardless, he worried that the lull was only leaving the door open for something else. Something new. It turns out, it was actually something old – though thankfully less lethal: cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5VZRXSS22ZDUZBLKTEX7EI6HUE"&gt;Gilson recalled the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s, which devastated many urban communities and coincided with a major crime wave. The crisis helped fuel the “tough-on-crime” era, leading to harsh sentencing laws and mass incarceration that disproportionately affected Black Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KWL4QG62FVEB7PC6U77US5UC4A"&gt;Back then the drug was killing 100-150 people a year in the county – a number which pales in comparison to the 600-700 who were dying at the peak of the opioid crisis. Now, though, the numbers are ticking upward again, and faster, partly fueled by cocaine-opioid mixtures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NOLQ3RXW5REB3JDQ5ISF7VSZKI"&gt;In August, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/pdfs/mm7432-H.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noting a rise in overdose deaths involving stimulants, like cocaine and methamphetamine, since 2011. Though it primarily attributed the increase to opioid mixtures, it noted that “stimulant-involved deaths without opioid co-involvement have also increased.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2YNUTQXLQNE27LOAWZEFR3NZIM"&gt;The CDC urged expanded access to evidence-based treatment for stimulant use disorder, along with outreach to people “who might be missed by opioid-focused prevention efforts.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RBKVTT2275AA7CAPFN3XDDPPNQ"&gt;After seeing the shift locally, Gilson is sounding his own alarm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SY66ZKG6ZNAGHDIQOEWDQQJLXQ"&gt;“Things are changing, and the demographics of who’s affected by it is changing, too,” Gilson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;New strategies?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IGVVZWY2TBETPOCTHNXB3C7SEI"&gt;In the early phases of the opioid epidemic, particularly with prescription painkillers, white communities bore the brunt of overdose deaths. Even as the crisis evolved and overall numbers leveled out, Gilson’s office continued to record higher rates of fentanyl and opioid fatalities among white residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__image"&gt;&lt;div class="article__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90 500w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90 800w" sizes="80vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=1280&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, (max-width: 800px) 80vw, 60vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Overdose deaths" class="hero-image" src="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=1280&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__image-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__mm-image-caption-text"&gt;Overdose data through the first half of the year shows a rise in cocaine-related deaths, especially among Black men.&lt;span class="article__mm-image-credit"&gt;(Courtesy of the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FVVQJ2YFZRHSXBCUUCRHA5O6QQ"&gt;However, the rise in cocaine overdoses is disproportionately affecting the Black community, echoing patterns seen in the 1980s and 1990s. In the first half of this year, overdose deaths among white residents declined compared to 2024, while the share among Black residents rose from 42% to 48%. Black men, in particular, were impacted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SAXFSHZCXNBKDFAVB27PU4CISE"&gt;“We’re reverting back to a pre-opioid phase,” Gilson said. “And that means we’re going to see another racial disparity develop like we did before.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R5DLTEDDFNEDNCOLVQJXOYSWG4"&gt;That makes directing prevention and treatment outreach specifically to Black communities both more urgent and more challenging, he said.

Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist trained at AIIMS, Harvard, and Stanford, recently highlighted key early warning signs and common misconceptions in an Instagram video. Early indicators include abdominal weight gain, persistent fatigue, discomfort under the right rib cage, skin and hair changes, and loss of appetite. Recognising these signs at home allows for timely intervention. Dr. Sethi emphasises that lifestyle changes, such as reducing processed sugars, eating whole foods, and exercising regularly, can protect liver health, prevent disease progression, and even reverse fatty liver in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As NAFLD becomes one of the most common liver conditions worldwide, Dr. Sethi’s advice highlights the importance of early detection, myth-busting, and lifestyle modification. By watching for subtle signs like abdominal fat, fatigue, or skin changes, individuals can intervene before minor symptoms escalate into serious health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Ways to check for fatty liver at home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to detect early &lt;keyword id="29109136" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Fatty-liver-symptoms-at-home" source="Orion"&gt;fatty liver symptoms at home&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Abdominal weight gain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest indicators of fatty liver is weight gain around the midsection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sethi explains that this often occurs due to insulin resistance, a condition where the body cannot efficiently process sugar. Insulin resistance forces the body to store excess fat, particularly around the abdomen, which is closely linked to liver stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While belly fat is often dismissed as a cosmetic concern, central obesity is actually a metabolic warning sign. The liver plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar and fat metabolism; fat accumulation around the waist may indicate that the liver is struggling to process nutrients efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Persistent fatigue&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel constantly tired, even after proper rest, this could signal liver dysfunction. Dr. Sethi emphasizes that persistent fatigue is often overlooked but is an early symptom of NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue at this stage can be a precursor to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe liver condition characterized by inflammation and scarring. Early detection through awareness of chronic fatigue can prevent progression to more serious liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Discomfort below the right rib cage&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is located beneath the right rib cage, and subtle discomfort in this area may indicate liver inflammation or enlargement. Dr. Sethi stresses that people often dismiss this symptom as digestive discomfort or muscle strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurring or persistent pain in the right upper abdomen can signal fatty deposits in the liver or early-stage liver inflammation, making it crucial to seek timely medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skin and hair changes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease often manifests externally. Changes such as acne, hair thinning, or darkened skin folds—especially around the neck or underarms—may indicate insulin resistance and liver stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sethi highlights that these visible signs are early indicators of metabolic disturbances that can eventually affect liver function. Recognizing them can prompt early lifestyle interventions to prevent further complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nausea and loss of appetite&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nausea and a sudden loss of appetite can be a result of overworked liver function. When the liver cannot efficiently process nutrients and toxins, it impacts digestion and triggers unexplained nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing these symptoms early—through dietary modifications and lifestyle adjustments—can prevent worsening liver function and the development of more serious conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Debunking common fatty liver myths&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Myth 1: Dietary fat causes fatty liver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, healthy fats like those in olive oil, nuts, and avocados support liver health. The true culprits are high-fructose foods and low-quality processed oils, which contribute to fat accumulation in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Myth 2: Fatty liver is harmless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver is often considered a mild condition, but untreated NAFLD can progress to liver scarring, cirrhosis, and even cancer. Early recognition and intervention are critical to preventing long-term liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle changes to protect your liver&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary recommendations by Dr. Sethi:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reducing processed sugars and unhealthy oils&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporating whole, unprocessed foods&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consuming liver-friendly healthy fats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical Activity and Liver Health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise complements a healthy diet, improving metabolic balance and reducing fat accumulation in the liver. Combining both dietary changes and physical activity provides the most effective approach to reversing fatty liver progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/high-cholesterol-cardiologists-reveal-two-everyday-foods-can-reduce-ldl-levels-and-support-long-term-heart-health-like-statins/articleshow/124146027.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;High cholesterol?

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health experts say turmeric is the best spice to reduce your risk of cancer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It may do this by reducing inflammation, guarding against cell damage and promoting gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turmeric is versatile, working well in oatmeal, baked goods, eggs, curries, lattes and more. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This year alone, the American Cancer Society predicts that more than 2 million people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While some factors, like age and genetics, are out of your control, there are things you can do to take charge of your risk. “The strongest evidence shows that a healthy lifestyle—including nutritious eating, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866755/best-exercises-for-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt;, avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol—offers the most effective, research-backed way to reduce cancer risk,” says oncologist&lt;a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/patients/find-a-doctor/tingting-tan" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; Tingting Tan, M.D., Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Can Help Tame Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; can increase your risk for many chronic diseases, including cancer. Short-term inflammation—like the redness and swelling that happens when you get a paper cut—is a normal part of our body’s defense system. However, too much inflammation can be a bad thing, especially when it becomes chronic, says &lt;a href="https://pamhartnett.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pam Hartnett, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Short bursts of inflammation are beneficial because they help the body heal from an injury,” she explains. “But when inflammation sticks around for too long, it creates an environment where cancer can grow more easily.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s where turmeric can step in. “By lowering this chronic inflammation, turmeric helps the immune system do its job of spotting and clearing out damaged cells before they turn cancerous,” Hartnett says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Protects Your Cells &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Throughout the day, your body naturally produces unstable compounds, called free radicals. Yet, chronically large numbers of free radicals may lead to cancer by damaging cells and their DNA. Fortunately, eating more antioxidant-rich foods, like turmeric, may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-reduce-skin-cancer-risk-11765954" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protect your cells&lt;/a&gt; by keeping free radical damage at bay. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering what makes it so powerful, research points to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-turmeric-supplements-8602203" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;compound in turmeric called curcumin&lt;/a&gt;. “Curcumin acts like an antioxidant, proactively protecting cells from DNA damage that can lead to mutations,” says&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/victoria-whittington-8609919" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourdietitianvictoria.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Victoria Whittington, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s more, curcumin’s antioxidant action may make it harder for cancerous cells to grow. “It acts like a roadblock, making it harder for damaged cells to multiply and form tumors,” explains Hartnett. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Promote Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’re increasingly learning that gut health plays a significant role in almost every aspect of our health, including the odds of developing cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research shows that turmeric’s curcumin may reduce cancer risk by bolstering the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health of your good gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; How so? “A healthier microbiome strengthens the gut lining, improves digestion, lowers inflammation and supports immunity,” says Hartnett. “All of these benefits work together to make the body more resilient against cancer.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As encouraging as this is, most studies to date have been conducted in cells or on animals. So, more research in humans is needed. In the meantime, there are plenty of other good reasons to enjoy turmeric.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This bright yellow spice pairs well with both sweet and savory dishes, so it’s a tasty addition to all kinds of foods and drinks. These tips can get you started. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair it with a healthy fat: &lt;/strong&gt;Turmeric is fat-soluble, meaning your body needs fat to absorb it, explains Whittington. For maximum benefit, she recommends using &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/turmeric-recipes-anti-inflammatory-boost-2025-8787388" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;turmeric in recipes&lt;/a&gt; that contain some fat, like olive or avocado oil, or coconut milk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go sweet: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, turmeric can be used in sweet dishes, too! “Try stirring turmeric into oatmeal along with cinnamon and honey for a golden breakfast bowl, or add a teaspoon to banana bread or muffins for a warm, earthy flavor,” says Hartnett.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprinkle it into everyday dishes: &lt;/strong&gt;Turmeric has a subtle, peppery flavor that lends itself well to everything from scrambled eggs to roasted veggies, soups and grain bowls. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add color to your favorite grain: &lt;/strong&gt;Next time you cook quinoa or brown rice, add a little turmeric to the cooking liquid. In addition to providing a dose of cancer protection, your grains will take on a beautiful, golden hue. For a golden rice that is both flavorful and cozy,&lt;a href="https://myfoodmychoicenutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Tracy Colin, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, recommends adding turmeric to white rice, with a little garlic and black pepper. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whisk it into drinks: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/281100/golden-milk-frappe/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Golden milk&lt;/a&gt;, made from turmeric, dairy or plant-based milk, black pepper and a touch of honey, is a soothing way to enjoy this powerful spice, says Whittington. “You can also toss a little turmeric into smoothies or teas,” she adds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spices have loads of health benefits. But if you’re looking for one to help reduce your risk of cancer, make it turmeric. Turmeric is rich in a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-ingredient-to-combine-with-turmeric-11694659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;compound called curcumin&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-for-lower-cancer-risk-11800236" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protects against cancer&lt;/a&gt; by reducing inflammation, guarding against cell damage and supporting a healthy gut. Plus, it’s incredibly versatile. It works beautifully in sweet dishes like oatmeal and baked goods. This bright yellow spice is an equally delicious—and stunning—addition to scrambled eggs, roasted veggies, curries, soups and grains. And it always shines in a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258547/turmeric-latte/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;comforting turmeric latte&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, no single food or drink can prevent cancer. “Turmeric isn’t a magic cancer shield, but it’s a solid teammate,” says Colin. Why not add it to your starting lineup?&lt;br&gt;

Dr Anya Topiwala, lead author on the paper, said: “Even light or moderate drinking may increase the risk of dementia, indicating that reducing alcohol consumption across the population could play a significant role in dementia prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went on to say that the common belief that a little bit of alcohol, the odd glass of red, say, might actually be good for the brain – neuroprotective – is almost certainly nonsense. “Genetic evidence offers no support for a protective effect,” she said. “In fact, it suggests the opposite.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it. Never mind congratulating yourselves for sticking to the government’s recommended guidelines on booze (14 units, spread out across seven days). Forget “everything in moderation!” and “A little bit of what you fancy does you good!” and: “I always do &lt;a href="/news/world/americas/american-alcohol-consumption-poll-b2807194.html" title="US alcohol consumption hits near-100 year low as fears over heath implications rise"&gt;Dry January&lt;/a&gt;, so…” According to this new report, any alcohol is a potential problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 geLykb"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/22/iStock-658672900.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/22/iStock-658672900.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/22/iStock-658672900.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The common belief that a little bit of alcohol might actually be good for the brain – neuroprotective – is almost certainly nonsense" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-148151"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The common belief that a little bit of alcohol might actually be good for the brain – neuroprotective – is almost certainly nonsense&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly? I’m not surprised. Slightly depressed – but not surprised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, I published my new book: &lt;em&gt;How the Female Body Works&lt;/em&gt;. It is the result of two-and-a-half years of hard, joyful research and writing, all focused around interviews with the most knowledgeable academics, medics, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/summer-mood-heat-brain-heatwave-b2779023.html" title="I’m a neuroscientist. Here’s what summer does to your brain"&gt;neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt;, gynaecologists, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/sleep-insomnia-meaning-symptoms-help-b2823747.html" title="Insomnia: The misunderstood sleep disorder you probably don’t have"&gt;psychologists&lt;/a&gt; and really any other world-renowned expert in women’s health I could get to talk to me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It covers every stage of women’s lives, from puberty to older age. I wrote it because I realised I knew virtually nothing about my own body, which was absurd. I’d also watched the internet slowly get flooded with contradictory, confusing “advice” and – often contradictory – “wisdom” about women’s bodies, so I set out to get some definitive answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked my experts questions like “What’s a brain made of?”, “are we our personality - or are we our hormones?”, “why are breasts the shape they are? “What makes a hot flush happen? Not just ‘falling oestrogen levels’… What’s the actual function?” Dumb-but-illuminating questions, from an ignoramus, to the people whose life’s work is women’s bodies, what happens to them, and how to heal and support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the facts I came up against really early on was: women are twice as likely to get an &lt;a href="/bulletin/news/alzheimers-disease-cause-treatment-b2833868.html" title="Scientists may have just found a new driver of Alzheimer’s"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; diagnosis as men. Which troubled me. The other thing, a sort of overarching narrative, which ended up lodged in my consciousness like a bad smell, was that alcohol really isn’t very good for us. It really isn’t. Which is a shame, because it can be so fun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is hard on everyone – implicated in everything from cancer to strokes to heart attacks to infections – but it’s far harder on women than it is on men. This is partly because women’s livers produce less of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase, or ADH, the purpose of which is to break down and eliminate alcohol from the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-left"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 gIycYG"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/15/59/9781915780072.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/15/59/9781915780072.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/15/59/9781915780072.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Polly Vernon’s book, ‘How the Female Body Works’, focused around interviews with the most knowledgeable academics, medics, neuroscientists, gynaecologists and psychologists" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-148152"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Polly Vernon’s book, ‘How the Female Body Works’, focused around interviews with the most knowledgeable academics, medics, neuroscientists, gynaecologists and psychologists&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (New River Books)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women’s ADH levels fall further yet, in &lt;a href="/news/uk/home-news/yougov-british-government-data-royal-college-of-gps-b2832923.html" title="Women ‘need to be taken seriously’ when they look for GP help – charity"&gt;peri menopause&lt;/a&gt; and menopause. Beyond that, the way fat is distributed on a woman’s body means it holds onto alcohol for longer, which means female bodies are exposed to alcohol’s toxicity for longer, leaving women more vulnerable to liver damage, heart disease, and at a higher risk of breast cancer. Oh, and also? While a woman is still experiencing a &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/creatine-for-women-benefits-effects-b2832637.html" title="Why experts are saying creatine might be a wonder supplement for women in midlife"&gt;menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol will act more aggressively on her body at certain points in that cycle, leaving her (for example) far drunker, far quicker, around the time she’s ovulating, than at any other point. This is because her body is uniquely concerned with getting her pregnant, so tedious things like processing and removing alcohol from her system get jettisoned. I know! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned all this from Dr Sharon Cox, principal research fellow at University College London, an extraordinary scientist, whose work focuses on addictive behaviours, particularly around alcohol and nicotine. All those existing problems, she tells me, have been further exacerbated by, she says: “Women drinking more than we ever have”. Drinking has gone up in both men and women since the pandemic, when we all spent our time making cocktails along with &lt;a href="/arts-entertainment/films/news/devil-wears-prada-2-emily-blunt-heels-wardrobe-b2818974.html" title="Emily Blunt says Devil Wears Prada 2 has been a ‘rude awakening’"&gt;Stanley Tucci &lt;/a&gt;on YouTube because there was nothing else to do, and the world was &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt;. “This is particularly in people over 30, and the increase in drinking was sharper in women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why?” I ask. “Stress?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These large national surveys tell us what is happening – not why. But yeah, it’s probably that alcohol was used as a stress relief - and it’s a difficult rut to get out from. [The increase has] mostly sustained.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At no point did Dr Cox tell me not to drink. She herself drinks… well, moderately. As do I. Assuming the concept of “moderately” means anything, after this latest report, which it probably doesn’t. In fact, none of the experts with whom I spoke for my book told me not to drink, or told me to tell my readers not to drink. It’s just that, when you interview – in depth – 20-ish of the world’s leading specialists on all aspects of women’s health, and nearly &lt;em&gt;every last one&lt;/em&gt; of them alludes, en passant, to booze, in a dispassionate, non-judgemental, scientific, but repeatedly critical way, for all manner of reasons, from all their different perspectives and individual areas of study, it’s tough to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now a new study emerges, connecting any alcohol consumption at all with possible increased risk of dementia – one which is already twice as high in women, as it is in men – and… I sort of want to give booze up, right here and now. Don’t you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 geLykb"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/24/sarah-jessica-parker_10.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/24/sarah-jessica-parker_10.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/12/24/sarah-jessica-parker_10.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Drinking has gone up in both men and women since the pandemic when we all spent our time making cocktails, a tipple favoured by Carrie Bradshaw on ‘Sex and the City’" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-148153"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Drinking has gone up in both men and women since the pandemic when we all spent our time making cocktails, a tipple favoured by Carrie Bradshaw on ‘Sex and the City’&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (HBO Max)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly? I sort of already have. If pre-book, I was “moderate” in my drinking, I’d now describe myself as not exactly sober… But really, not&lt;em&gt; not &lt;/em&gt;sober, either. Physically, I have felt that enzyme in my liver, ADH, falter with age, got to a point where now, the very first sip of wine (once, so joyful, so promising, so potent!) triggers memories not of my last fun, feckless night out – but of my last &lt;a href="/travel/europe/spain/ibiza/ibiza-wellness-gen-x-raver-b2823880.html" title="I’m a Gen X retired raver – here’s how I swapped hedonism for high-end wellness in Ibiza"&gt;hangover&lt;/a&gt;, the associated anxiety and anguish, all of which, by the way, were the consequence of barely three-and-a-half glasses of house white! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being drunk used to be so fun! The silliness of tipsiness, the sweet slipe-slide toward disinhibition! I’m wondering if this instinctual and informed growing wariness around booze, coupled with a desire not to live a sober life, might explain the increasing number of people I know, ditching alcohol. The brilliant neuroscientist I interviewed for the book, Dr Sarah McKay, told me she’s hopeful the way women live their lives now – how much more educated we are, how much more likely to work, and have good, deep, social connections – which also leaves us at an advantage over earlier generations of women in terms of neuroprotection – our brains’ defences against cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, should we just be giving up alcohol, full stop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask Dr Federica Amati. She’s the head nutritionist at &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/house-garden/bedroom/best-anti-snore-pillow-uk-b1828630.html" title="11 best anti-snore pillows, tried and tested for better sleep"&gt;ZOE&lt;/a&gt;, a trusted source; earlier this summer, she caused ructions on Paul Sculfor’s&lt;em&gt; This Is Powerful &lt;/em&gt;podcast by saying: “If you look at alcohol as a drug – like, as a pharmaceutical drug… they’ve calculated what the safe amount would be to consume before these neurotoxic, genotoxic {when a substance damages DNA] effects. And it’s two units a year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do [want to] give some nuance to that,” she tells me. Please! I say. Here for the nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can choose some exposures we subject our body to,” Dr Amati says. “And alcohol may be one of them. But we need to be informed of the impact on our health. I have the occasional glass of red – but I don’t fool myself, it’s good for me.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So: drink sometimes, but understand what it’s doing to you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t if you don’t… But if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, make sure you’re clear on the risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%3Fk%3Dhow%2Bthe%2Bfemale%2Bbody%2Bworks%26adgrpid%3D166052243252%26gad_source%3D1%26hvadid%3D746368510002%26hvdev%3Dm%26hvexpln%3D70%26hvlocphy%3D9045997%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvocijid%3D16245590333053692243--%26hvqmt%3De%26hvrand%3D16245590333053692243%26hvtargid%3Dkwd-388622370211%26mcid%3D3aaf35d2c1aa3adcb627295278c10a7b%26tag%3Dhydrukspg-21%26ref%3Dpd_sl_7akl739467_e_p70"&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘How the Female Body Works (in all its miraculous glory)’ by Polly Vernon’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is out now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNWWhXMjhOWi1iVV9NTVNVMjNoTlZoTUVCSG9ua09yck9lU1Nrc2ViN2Y4RG81MWNMUVo3bURONmJ4REtmMnQ1QVl1LVVJTnVGc1lwQjdEYnhGNTNzVldiZF9mZjU1Vy1UZWtYQmEwc1ZVMlVhcUhGZ2c4Zl9Eeld0ZnZCUjNaOUIyV2NXbHMwcmFON3NndFFjOTBWaUVWVmRINFJF</guid></item></channel></rss>
