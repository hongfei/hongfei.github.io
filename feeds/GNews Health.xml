&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. &lt;a href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/1727/shilpa-grover-gastroenterology_hepatology_and_endoscopy-boston" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Shilpa Grover&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the onco-gastroenterology program in the division of gastroenterology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, refined grains aren’t great for your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies that have evaluated dietary patterns have clearly shown that a high intake of red and processed meat and refined grains is associated with an increased risk of [inflammatory pouches in the digestive tract] called diverticulitis,” she said. “Contrary to what was thought earlier, nuts, corn, and popcorn are not associated with an increase in the risk of developing diverticulosis, or complications like diverticulitis or bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But your gut health isn’t all you have to watch out for when it comes to eating a diet high in red meat and refined grains. “Those same diets recommended to decrease the risk of health conditions such as diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/coronary-artery-disease" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;coronary artery disease&lt;/a&gt; and cancer, including colorectal cancer, are also likely to decrease the risk of diverticulitis,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re mourning a loss of identity as you contemplate spending your summer months without a single hot dog, worry not: A hot dog here and there won’t destroy your gut health. Just go easy on them — and maybe add sauerkraut for some gut-boosting benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-digestion-health_l_6411d77ce4b0a3902d2e1014" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879767"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="block"&gt;But a growing number of patients claim Ozempic can come with a terrifying side effect: Irreversible vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Edward Fanelli, a former contractor from Freehold, New Jersey, said he was prescribed Ozempic to manage his diabetes, but within months, his vision went dark - forcing him to give up his career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"Not even six to eight months later, I, out of nowhere, I could not see out of my right eye," he says. "I couldn't take a chance do the contracting work, worried about cutting my fingers off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Fanelli says he was diagnosed with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a sudden on-set condition with no cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;He is the first patient in New Jersey to file a lawsuit in state court against the makers of Ozempic, claiming he was never warned the blockbuster drug could lead to irreversible vision loss.

	"If they would have told me a chance I could lose my vision, I would not have taken it. Don't care - weight loss would have done on my own," he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;He’s not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="block"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long Island-based attorney Jason Goldstein, of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourlawyer.com/"&gt;Parker Waichman LLP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, represents more than a dozen clients, including Fanelli, in lawsuits that center on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the active ingredient in Ozempic and similar drugs, which has now been linked in medical literature to NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Goldstein claims the drugmakers failed to warn patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"That's the crux of this case, people are not warned about this. What did the doctor know? What did the patient know? No one knew," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Goldstein says he will be pushing for updated warning labels and compensation so future patients don't find themselves negatively impacted by a drug they thought would help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A Novo Nordisk spokesperson released the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"NAION is a very rare eye disease, and it is not an adverse drug reaction for the marketed formulations of semaglutide (Ozempic®, Rybelsus® and Wegovy®) as per the approved labels. After a thorough evaluation of studies from the University of Southern Denmark and Novo Nordisk’s internal safety assessment, Novo Nordisk is of the opinion that the benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Novo Nordisk, on its part, has conducted an analysis across randomized controlled clinical trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including a blinded ophthalmologist evaluation to confirm NAION diagnoses. These data do not suggest a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA use and NAION events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously. This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes. Any decision to start treatment with prescription-only medicines should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional who should do a benefit-risk evaluation for the patient in question, weighing up the benefits of treatment with the potential risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 - Long Island</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 23:37:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNN0pCNHBkYkF6dDlyaWNGMTdOTmg4MFoxZDBMMGktcFBpZ1hac1d3YlFfZnVCbW1qd3Zqcjc3MU1HMXFsU2FpdlNHaS1jN3pFNUNIVWFrQVc4bFE4SlJpZG5ULUFmdElMbU1OUEZvZURMNHBDeEJVY0F5NGkyVlVVT2NOVVBWMmxkbkM2b1BxOWlBNnM1NzEzVml0ZjZxUHViT29DZkpUOWMxVENIVmc</guid></item><item><title>三城诺如病毒胃流感学校、疗养院- Tri-City Herald | Norovirus stomach flu sickening schools, nursing homes in Tri-Cities - Tri-City Herald</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5aWjlGYWNxNzJrbnBuTGNoYXVrUVRBN1VYZS0wU0dhdFlHSHNLcDlxMHd6LXFtOUh3TkNSSGtpVF93dkpFSTBEVmM1aGgzY3FXTk5ZV3ZxTnY0cG1CbnJuNGhuWU1jQ0FfV1p5T0h0VGzSAXBBVV95cUxQazd4clFUYjJCdjhicHF3Q2FWZkNnODNHQk8zQUFIVTJiYm9FU2hvWE9TdDZscm9mSVRMVHZHVkQ1U3QxbkhLREZNaURXd3FWT0dDRFA3ZXNlX2NIclNzMDhlMTMxWGd4cUItWFVYSVB1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="" class="paper story-body"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Kennewick, WA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the Tri-Cities and have been feeling ill, it may be &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/norovirus" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;norovirus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.bfhd.wa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;Benton Franklin Health District&lt;/a&gt; reports a sharp rise in the highly contagious stomach bug throughout the two counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been reported recently in schools and long-term care facilities, according to the district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms are unpleasant — watery diarrhea, explosive projectile vomiting and stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also may have a fever, body aches and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for most people the illness passes quickly, often within one to two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the virus lives on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Norovirus ‘tough to kill’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the reasons norovirus spreads so easily is because it’s extremely tough to kill,” said Dr. Steve Krager, health officer for the Benton Franklin Health District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The virus has a protective outer shell that makes it resistant to many common disinfectants and alcohol-based hand sanitizers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can survive on surfaces for days, potentially infecting people who touch them. And people who fall ill with norovirus are contagious from the time they start feeling ill to a few days after they recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is easily spread through direct contact with infected people, touching contaminated surfaces or eating food prepared by someone who is infected. Symptoms can develop within 12 to 48 hours of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;            &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/z6c0oi/picture297718168/alternates/FREE_1140/1192ea8a-2c85-4c46-84a6-2ee878c12a96" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;

In mice with a mutated &lt;em&gt;NLRP3&lt;/em&gt; gene, inflammation activated microglia to release IL-1β, overstimulating NMDA glutamate receptors responsible for excitatory brain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This overactivation triggered anxiety and meaningless repetitive actions. Administering memantine or interleukin-1RA, both FDA-approved drugs, normalized brain activity and stopped the behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic brain inflammation from &lt;em&gt;NLRP3&lt;/em&gt; mutation causes repetitive behaviors via NMDA receptor overactivation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Repurposing:&lt;/strong&gt; FDA-approved drugs memantine and interleukin-1RA reversed these effects in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cytokine Cascade:&lt;/strong&gt; IL-1β released by microglia plays a key role in triggering behavioral symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DGIST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetitive behaviors, such as repeatedly checking whether doors are locked or washing one’s hands multiple times, may be experienced by anyone at least once and may result in ASD or OCD if the behaviors are severe. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although neural circuit abnormalities and genetic factors have been regarded among the potential causes of repetitive behaviors, no direct association between brain inflammation and these behaviors was identified until Professor Um’s research team suggested that brain inflammation may play a critical role in repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110143"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers also found clues about how brain inflammation stimulates NMDA glutamate receptors. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research involved mice with a mutated NLRP3 gene. This gene mutation stimulates a chronic inflammatory response by immune cells in the brain that are called microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged inflammation over-activates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, which are important for excitatory neurotransmission. The consequences are meaningless repetitive behaviors and anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having noted that over-activate NMDA glutamate receptors cause repetitive behaviors, the research team administered a drug called memantine, a commercially available treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, to the mice with the NLRP3 gene mutation and found that the drug significantly reduced meaningless repetitive behaviors and that NMDA glutamate activity returned to normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that over-active NMDA glutamate receptors directly cause repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found clues about how brain inflammation stimulates NMDA glutamate receptors. They have revealed that inflamed microglia release a pro-inflammatory substance (cytokine) called interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), which affects NMDA glutamate receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mice were injected with a drug that blocks the activity of interleukin-1 receptors (interleukin-1RA), it suppressed overactivity in the NMDA glutamate receptors, and the repetitive behaviors disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memantine and interleukin-1RA (product name: Anakinra), which were used in the study, are treatments that are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are currently used to manage Alzheimer’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These readily available drugs of proven safety and efficacy can be repurposed to treat ASD and OCD, negating the need to develop new drugs. As a strategy, drug repurposing reduces drug discovery time and costs, helping to commercialize treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Jiwon Um said, “This study has demonstrated that chronic brain inflammation induces overactivity in NMDA glutamate receptors, resulting in repetitive behavioral disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We may be able to suggest a new therapeutic approach for treating ASD and OCD, which are often accompanied by repetitive behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hyeji Jung of the Department of Brain Sciences within the DGIST was the first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research findings were published online on May 7, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, a scientific journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Ministry of Science and Information Communication Technology and the National Research Foundation of Korea as part of the Basic Research Center Support Project and the Mid-Career Researcher Support Project.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this inflammation, ASD, and OCD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3f7a6b5a6b1b283a7a4aab0b7eda2a0eda8b1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wankyu Lim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dgist.ac.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DGIST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Wankyu Lim – DGIST&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia regulates repetitive behavior by modulating NMDA glutamate receptor functions&lt;/a&gt;” by Jiwon Um et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia regulates repetitive behavior by modulating NMDA glutamate receptor functions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation is a well-established risk factor for various neurological disorders and cognitive decline. However, the precise molecular mechanisms linking inflammation with neuropsychiatric symptoms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, using NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3) conditional knockin (cKI) mice harboring a D301N point mutation originating in patients with autoinflammatory diseases, we found that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by administration of lipopolysaccharide induced anxiety-like and repetitive behaviors frequently found in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as increasing NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor)-mediated excitatory synaptic functions in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), a downstream cytokine of the NLRP3 inflammasome, enhanced NMDAR activation and increased surface levels of the selective NMDAR subunit GluN2A in cultured cortical neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, treatment with an NMDAR antagonist or IL-1 receptor antagonist completely normalized the specific behavioral deficits in &lt;em&gt;Nlrp3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;D301N&lt;/sup&gt;-cKI mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, our results demonstrate that NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation elicits repetitive behavior through impaired NMDAR functions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 21:04:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5PWTZUb3ptSzJUM0hKbG5pMzhIYnVXbW4wQTJ5MUxGTVkzbmY5MHY4a016MHcxMnd3Z3lnMFNGam02amJxZUZGV3ZFalRTeUhCN3hXV2hSZlR5TGZRa1lydVhDM2FlWFRyekI4UFdfaWlaSDQ</guid></item><item><title>干燥综合征患者罹患非霍奇金淋巴瘤的风险较高：研究-干燥综合征新闻 | Sjögren’s patients have higher risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Study - Sjogren's Syndrome News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQdVY3eW5QZm9NYjJ2eDAzYi1VWC1TVlpGOW1lRWVEckREVGFnUUxoSFE3ZVYxZ3lBN0ktemdYLUdmRklXd0szQjJmZmM4NXllQVBfbUY3OW1GSDl0Q2J5S2tLak5lNXJtSFNGenFzQk9BUk1aNklBLUJydGRfbXQ0bE11XzdfdWFkcGV3djlLTG1IcEdRRFhsTFJfcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/what-is-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s disease&lt;/a&gt; are at higher risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a type of blood cancer, as well as other malignancies, a study reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers also identified several risk factors associated with &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/news/analysis-finds-increased-risk-cancer-sjogrens-syndrome-patients/"&gt;cancer development&lt;/a&gt; in Sjögren’s patients, noting that nearly a quarter of deaths seen among these patients could be attributed to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings underscore the need for early identification of high-risk patients and the refinement of risk prediction models,” researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049017225001143"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cancer risk in Sjögren’s Disease: A longitudinal cohort study on incidence, predictors, and mortality impact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Link between Sjögren’s, solid tumors investigated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sjögren’s is a chronic autoimmune disorder marked by dry eyes and mouth, among &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;other symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown Sjögren’s is linked to an increased risk of NHL. However, research remains split on whether other types of cancer, particularly solid tumors, are more likely to arise in people with Sjögren’s than in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this link, researchers examined data from 314 people &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/diagnosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;diagnosed with Sjögren’s&lt;/a&gt; who were receiving care at one of several clinics in Spain. Most (94.6%) were female, and were diagnosed at a median age of 49.9 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a median of 9.5 years of follow-up, 7% of patients developed cancer. Of these, half developed blood cancer, specifically NHL. The other half had solid malignancies, with breast cancer being the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with people in Spain of similar age and sex, patients with Sjögren’s had a 68% higher chance of developing cancer. That risk was even higher for blood cancers, with Sjögren’s patients being 3.55 times more likely to develop such cancers than people from the general population. For solid tumors, the risk was 1.54 times higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NHL alone accounted for the most of the excess cancer risk, underscoring its central role in [Sjögren’s disease]-associated malignancy,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using statistical analyses, the researchers identified a series of risk factors associated with cancer development in Sjögren’s patients. Malignancy predictors included lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), cryoglobulinemia (a condition where abnormal proteins clump in the blood), and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). Older age and smoking were identified as independent risk factors for cancer development as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;NHL alone accounted for the most of the excess cancer risk, underscoring its central role in [Sjögren’s disease]-associated malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team also found a prior history of cancer in Sjögren’s patients significantly increased the risk of blood cancer development over that of a solid malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses showed significantly more participants with blood cancers used antimalarials, a class of medications that can also help manage Sjögren’s symptoms, than participants with solid tumors. Patients with blood cancers also had higher levels of beta-2 microglobulin, a small protein that can be used as a tumor marker, compared with those with solid malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the follow-up period, cancer accounted for 23.8% of deaths among study participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings underscore the substantial impact of malignancy on overall mortality, revealing that cancer-related deaths account for a significant proportion of excess mortality in [Sjögren’s disease] patients,” the researchers wrote. “These results reinforce the need for tailored malignancy screening strategies …, particularly for high-risk patients with identified predictors such as lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and cryoglobulinemia.”&lt;/p&gt;

People with high levels of neuroticism—a trait linked to emotional instability—were much more likely to experience sleep disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, individuals scoring higher in openness showed lower levels of insomnia, suggesting a protective effect. Anxiety was found to be the key mechanism mediating the relationship between neuroticism and insomnia, while depression was not a significant factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroticism Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; 61.7% of insomniacs had high neuroticism vs. 32% of non-insomniacs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Trait:&lt;/strong&gt; Openness to experience was linked with lower insomnia rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Anxiety fully mediates the relationship between neuroticism and insomnia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAPESP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study conducted at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo (USP) in Brazil examined the influence of personality traits on the development and perpetuation of insomnia and found that there is a direct relationship between the two. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two findings caught the researchers’ attention: high levels of openness were associated with low levels of insomnia, while high levels of neuroticism (characterized by emotional instability) were very common in people with the sleep disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sleep Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We decided to study the influence of personality traits on insomnia because it’s an extremely common disorder that has negative health consequences, such as an increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These different physical and mental health conditions lead to a poorer quality of life in general,” explains Bárbara Araújo Conway, sleep psychologist and author of the master’s dissertation defended at the Institute of Psychiatry of FM-USP, with the support of FAPESP and under the supervision of Professor Renatha El Rafihi-Ferreira, of the Department of Clinical Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the authors explain, insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders in adults. It is estimated that around 30% of the world’s population suffers from the problem, which is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep or returning to sleep after an unwanted awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, specifically in the city of São Paulo, this figure is even higher: almost half of the population (45%) suffers from insomnia, according to data from the Epidemiological Sleep Study (EPISONO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five personality traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Conway, there is a well-established theory in the literature that proposes the existence of the “3 Ps” of insomnia: predisposition (factors that make an individual more likely to have the disorder), precipitation (triggers associated with the onset of symptoms) and perpetuation (behaviors that cause the person to remain in the vicious cycle of insomnia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the researchers hypothesized that neuroticism, which is more prevalent in insomniacs, could be considered a predisposing factor for sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also examined whether symptoms of anxiety and depression might act as mediators and moderators of the association between neuroticism and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to understand how the authors arrived at the results of the study, we need to take a step back and learn about personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are characteristics that estimate a pattern of what a particular person’s feelings, thoughts and behaviors are like. They’re a set of factors that make up an individual’s personality and characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“According to the Big Five theory, we all have different levels of the five personality traits,” the psychologist explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Extroversion:&lt;/strong&gt; People with higher levels of extroversion tend to be more talkative, more dominant, with a leadership profile. They prefer group activities, find it easier to relate and create intimacy and tend to be more assertive. People with low levels of extroversion, on the other hand, are not necessarily introverts, but they prefer to be more alone and tend to find it more difficult to work in groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Neuroticism: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a personality trait related to the degree of emotional stability. People with high levels of neuroticism tend to be more emotionally unstable and focus on the more negative aspects of life. They are people who, when faced with adversity, tend to become disorganized, suffer more intensely, and are more susceptible to stress. Scientific literature shows that high neuroticism correlates with anxiety and depression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Agreeableness: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a personality trait related to empathy. People with high levels of agreeableness tend to be more empathetic, more cordial and concerned about the well-being of others, focusing a lot on the other person’s situation (they may even be naive and value the other person to the detriment of themselves). Those with low scores tend to be more skeptical and suspicious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Openness to experience: &lt;/strong&gt;People who are open to new experiences tend to be more creative, with exploratory behavior in the face of novelty. They are curious, imaginative and experience emotions more intensely. People with low levels of openness are those who prefer routine, avoid discomfort and tend to be conventional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Conscientiousness:&lt;/strong&gt; This can also be called achievement. People with high levels are determined, committed, motivated, persevering and can sacrifice momentary pleasures in pursuit of a greater goal. A very high index may not be good because it can lead to perfectionism. Those with low scores are less demanding, less stubborn, and would be considered “lazy” in the common sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To arrive at the results, the researchers studied 595 participants between the ages of 18 and 59, divided into two groups: one made up of insomniacs who had sought help and received a formal diagnosis from a sleep specialist, and the other half was a control group of people who had no complaints of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant’s personality levels were determined using a 60-question, score-based questionnaire used exclusively by psychology professionals. Volunteers from both groups answered the questions, allowing the researchers to determine the scores for each person’s personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying the questionnaire to the two groups, cross-checking and analyzing the data, Conway found that the insomnia patients had much higher scores for neuroticism than the non-insomnia subjects, as well as lower scores for agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extroversion was the only personality trait that did not show a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neuroticism was the trait that stood out the most, with insomniacs having a much higher rate. But we can’t say that insomniacs are more introverted,” Conway ponders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyses also showed that: 61.7% of the insomniacs had high levels of neuroticism compared to 32% of the control group; 40.7% of the insomniacs had low levels of openness compared to 23% of the healthy group; 31.5% of the subjects with insomnia had low levels of agreeableness compared to 23.2% of the non-insomniacs; and 37.7% of the insomniacs had low levels of conscientiousness compared to 24.1% of the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After more detailed statistical analysis, the results of the study allow us to assert that people with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to have insomnia,” says the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also carried out a statistical analysis to see if any other factor might be confounding the association between neuroticism and insomnia, and discovered that anxiety acts as a mediating mechanism, meaning that it is the symptoms of anxiety that actually cause neuroticism to influence the development of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It explains the whole effect of high neuroticism on insomnia,” says the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also tested the role of depression, but it did not prove to be an important mechanism in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect on practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that personality traits are associated with positive or negative physical and mental health outcomes, the study suggests that it is important to know the most prevalent personality traits among individuals with insomnia so that this knowledge can help in the process of assessment, prevention and planning of more appropriate treatments according to the specific characteristics of each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results confirm that in order to treat a patient’s insomnia, it is also necessary to assess and treat their anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are important in clinical practice because when receiving patients with this personality trait, it’s essential to think about a treatment plan that focuses not only on sleep but also on anxiety,” says El Rafihi-Ferreira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for this to happen, healthcare professionals need to understand and assess the personalities of patients who seek help for sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that most insomniacs are highly neurotic. These patients deserve to have their anxiety assessed and treated so that their insomnia also improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes this involves different therapies and medications, so it’s important to take a broader look at each individual’s history and specifics,” Conway emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the treatment considered the “gold standard” for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), but there are still too few psychologists specializing in sleep in Brazil to offer it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the researchers advocate that health professionals take a broader view and delve deeper into the study of patients’ psychological factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The association between personality traits, anxiety and insomnia makes it important to develop transdiagnostic treatment protocols, i.e. those that involve the integration of behavioral techniques and processes to treat a range of emotional difficulties that share processes and mechanisms underlying the different complaints,” says the study’s supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already have a non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia, but just as we don’t have a drug that will be effective for all patients, a single therapy approach may not work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results contribute to the development of new, more personalized psychological and behavioral protocols for the treatment of insomnia,” Conway concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this insomnia and personality traits research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8ee6fcebe7e0ebfcfacee8effeebfdfea0ecfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heloisa Reinert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fapesp.br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAPESP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Heloisa Reinert – FAPESP&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jsr.70003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Personality traits and insomnia: direct and anxiety-mediated associations&lt;/a&gt;” by Bárbara Araújo Conway et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sleep Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality traits and insomnia: direct and anxiety-mediated associations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia is the one of the most prevalent sleep disorders in the adult population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that personality traits, particularly neuroticism, act as factors that predispose to and potentially perpetuate insomnia; however, there is still no consensus in the literature regarding these relationships considering their mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 595 participants answered the Insomnia Severity Index, Revised Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness (NEO) Five-Factor Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, questions of the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/em&gt; (fifth edition), and a sociodemographic questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descriptive analysis, correlations and stepwise linear regression were used to assess the associations between the five personality traits and insomnia severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediation and moderation analyses were performed to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the association between insomnia severity and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a direct negative association between insomnia severity and openness to experience and an indirect positive association between insomnia severity and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety was identified as a mediator and depression as a moderator of the association between insomnia severity and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neuroticism and openness to experience personality traits are significant predictors of insomnia severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Openness to experience appears to be a protective factor against insomnia. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results may contribute to the development of new psychological and behavioural protocols for the treatment of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 20:27:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9zbzVzTTQ1NkN1X2xZS01XZjNBdnpBYzJGeURqU3VkVGdldDIwUUhVTjF6MlV5MTJZUVcyTFFYSmg4djhLOGhDbUtYb08zR3ZWaV93QTIzTzRjSG1zaUZWR0xUWEM1eVlwbnBLUkpGMVdoQWpTbnNv</guid></item><item><title>布莱恩·约翰逊（ Bryan Johnson ）、梅尔·吉布森（ Mel Gibson- ） ，可能还有小RFK （ RFK Jr. ）穿着亚甲蓝以下是科学所说的-财富 | Bryan Johnson, Mel Gibson—and possibly RFK Jr.—swear by methylene blue for wellness.

Whether you hopped on the bandwagon and began drinking &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/personal-care/can-prebiotic-soda-hurt-your-teeth-heres-what-experts-say/" target="_self"&gt;prebiotic or probiotic beverages&lt;/a&gt;, many people have become obsessed with healing their gut to avoid embarrassing symptoms like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/we-all-bloat-but-heres-how-to-know-if-its-a-problem/" target="_self"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt; and/or flatulence. In fact, the trillions of microbes living in your gut, collectively known as the &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/microbiome/" target="_self"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, serve as your body's internal environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Consider your &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-microbiome#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-microbiome%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22gut%20microbiome%22}" target="_self"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; as "little pets living inside your intestinal tract," Cleveland Clinic microbiome expert Gail Cresci explains. These microbes help break down food, regulate inflammation, support immunity and even produce essential compounds like vitamins and hormones. This is why it's vital to understand your body's warning signs and be able to identify when something is not quite right. So to answer the big question of how to keep your gut healthy, read on for a couple of health hacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/experts-share-what-your-bowel-movements-say-about-your-health/" target="_self"&gt; Are Your Poops Regular? Experts Share What Your Bowel Movements Mean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs of an unhealthy gut &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're bloated or you have lots of gas, you may have a disrupted composition and function of the gut microbiome," Cresci said, adding that the only way to know for sure is to have it &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/microbiome-testing" target="_self"&gt;measured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other signs of an unhealthy gut may include vomiting or stomach upset, fatigue, trouble sleeping, food intolerance &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gut-health#improving-gut-health" target="_self"&gt;and other symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Skin irritation or problems may be one particularly visible sign, as some research &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048199/" target="_self"&gt;links skin issues like acne and psoriasis&lt;/a&gt; to the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking into how it &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/hropen/article/2022/2/hoac015/6553029" target="_self"&gt;impacts reproductive health&lt;/a&gt; and hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/the-abcs-of-apple-cider-vinegar-benefits-precautions-and-proper-dosage/" target="_self"&gt;The ABCs of Apple Cider Vinegar: Benefits, Precautions and Proper Dosage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Carol Yepes/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to help your gut &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to see a doctor to get to the root cause of your health concern and rule out other conditions. Making changes to your diet or routine that may improve your gut, and your overall health is a good first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to keep in mind that there's no exact standard for the perfectly healthy gut microbiome, Cresci said, since everyone's composition is so different. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Eat these gut-friendly foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes foods with a lot of fiber, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods to remove from your gut, or eat in lower amounts, include foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/5-heart-healthy-foods-to-add-to-your-grocery-list-this-week/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Make note of the medications you're taking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a well-known fact that taking antibiotics &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732679/" target="_self"&gt;disrupts, at least temporarily, the family of "good" bacteria&lt;/a&gt; thriving in your body. Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/pdfs/aaw/au_arent_always_the_answer_fs_508.pdf" target="_self"&gt;common side effects&lt;/a&gt; of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the PH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists, or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; probiotics or supplements &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/news/7-best-probiotics/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;seek a probiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/how-do-probiotics-improve-your-gut-health/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mimic an intact microbiota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and "each strain has their own method of action." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking it for bowel regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever it is your problem is," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unfortunately, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you," Cresci said. "You have to do the other part too." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;piotr_malczyk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Move your body every day and prioritize sleep &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get better sleep" or "exercise more" might sound like tired advice, but improving your sleep hygiene and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/10-workouts-youre-probably-already-doing-every-day/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;squeezing in more physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are tried and true ways to improve your health, including your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise may &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;help your gut in different ways&lt;/a&gt;, including by improving your circulation, helping your metabolism and aiding your digestive muscles, according to information from the Cleveland Clinic. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/exercise-snacks-are-just-as-healthy-as-a-full-workout-heres-why/" target="_self"&gt;small ways&lt;/a&gt; you can get your body in the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;habit of moving every day&lt;/a&gt; or at least more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too. So if we're eating when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to properly process the nutrients of our food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking sleep also triggers an increase in stress and cortisol, which have &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative mental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and physical impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot going on with the gut-brain interaction, so that signals back to the microbiome, and vice versa," Cresci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.637010/full#h11" target="_self"&gt;including exercising&lt;/a&gt; or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which impact our gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're sleepy, tired, exhausted, you tend not to do the things we know are good for microbiomes," Cresci said. "So it kind of perpetuates itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq" class="c-shortcodeFaq g-container-rounded-small"&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_sections" class="c-shortcodeFaq_sections"&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding fiber to your diet and drinking more water are easy first steps to a healthier gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, probiotics like curd are good bacteria that assist with digestion and improve your microbiome and overall gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQaGN4LUM1ZkVqTnlpWS1HSWtzdDZ6VGtwZXRjZXplT0JLM3F0S1pHYjZCYWpDN29qR0szTm9QbXdabGRuWkZ6TkVCaVptUmgzXzN4S1dQZlNFb3hBcGF5WmNQbXhCdlI5cEhMb3I1YkxVN1dNX2tvaWp0ZmV0MHZQRFA1Y1MtU2dpTFJr</guid></item><item><title>每晚睡8小时实际上会恶化您的心脏健康—如果您这样做-研究发现 | Sleeping 8 Hours Every Night Can Actually Worsen Your Heart Health — If You’re Doing This - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTFBLRDd2WXl3X1dqWXBnXzlKNW1NeExMWmpPLTJWYzdMMF9Zc0c0QkdvMF9yTFdEQXpyb3o2N0l4bmxTR1pTRkNqeERPNnNBYzVzaEo0cmJXVFl0eDlMMmZpcDdiR3NLREstbUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img src="" alt="A woman sleeping happily" data-lazy-src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/shutterstock_1608735547-1200x800.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/shutterstock_1608735547-1200x800.jpg" alt="A woman sleeping happily"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;Getting enough sleep doesn't ensure heart health without having a regular sleep schedule.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with irregular sleep schedules had a 26% higher risk of major cardiovascular events—including heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure—even if they got the recommended amount of sleep.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sleep regularity may matter just as much as sleep duration: going to bed and waking up at consistent times was linked to significantly better heart health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The study found a clear dose-response relationship, with higher sleep regularity scores tied to lower cardiovascular risk; an SRI score of 77.1 or above was associated with a 15–18% risk reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTTAWA, Canada — &lt;/strong&gt;Even if you’re getting enough sleep overall, inconsistent bedtimes and wake-up times might be putting your heart at serious risk. An international study shows that people with irregular sleep schedules face a significantly higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure, regardless of whether they clock the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/79/4/257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, followed more than 72,000 adults for nearly eight years and discovered that those with the most chaotic sleep patterns had a 26% higher risk of major cardiovascular events compared to people who maintained regular sleep schedules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also found that getting the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sleep-an-important-antidote-for-depression-and-anxiety-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommended amount of sleep&lt;/a&gt; didn’t protect irregular sleepers from heart problems. For millions of Americans whose work schedules, family responsibilities, or lifestyle habits lead to erratic sleep patterns, this could be a wake-up call about a previously underappreciated heart risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from institutions including the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute and the University of Sydney used data from the UK Biobank, analyzing information from 72,269 adults aged 40-79 who wore wrist accelerometers for a week to precisely measure their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt;. The team calculated each participant’s “Sleep Regularity Index” (SRI), a measure that captures day-to-day consistency in bedtime, wake-up time, sleep duration, and awakenings during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;More than just sleep duration goes into your sleep health. (Krakenimages.com/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SRI is scored from 0 (completely random sleep-wake times) to 100 (perfectly consistent sleep patterns). Participants were divided into three groups: those with regular sleep (SRI above 87.3), moderately irregular sleep (SRI between 71.6 and 87.3), and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poor-sleep-gut-harmful-bacteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;irregular sleep&lt;/a&gt; (SRI below 71.6).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After following participants for an average of 7.8 years, researchers documented 4,887 major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)—a measure that includes &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strokes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;. Even after accounting for numerous factors like age, physical activity, diet, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/smoking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/alcohol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, and existing health conditions, the findings remained accurate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-risks-and-irregular-sleep"&gt;Heart Risks and Irregular Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/irregular-sleep-depression-moods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;irregular sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt; had a 26% higher risk of experiencing a MACE event compared to regular sleepers. Even those with moderately irregular sleep patterns showed an 8% increased risk. This connection was particularly strong for heart failure, with irregular sleepers facing a 45% higher risk compared to consistent sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also looked at the combination of sleep regularity and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/better-sleep-green-streets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep duration&lt;/a&gt;. Conventional wisdom might suggest that as long as you’re getting enough sleep, some irregularity wouldn’t matter. This data shows that might not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with irregular sleep patterns faced an elevated &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/periodontitis-gum-disease-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular risk&lt;/a&gt; even if they slept the recommended 7-9 hours (for adults under 65) or 7-8 hours (for those 65 and older). While sufficient sleep partially offset the risk for moderately irregular sleepers, it didn’t help those with the most erratic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The relationship between sleep irregularity and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/heart-problems-brain-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular problems&lt;/a&gt; appears to follow a dose-response pattern. This means that the more irregular your sleep, the higher your risk. However, the researchers identified a threshold: an SRI score of at least 77.1 was associated with a 15% reduction in cardiovascular risk, while the median score of 80.8 correlated with an 18% risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-inconsistent-sleep-hurts-your-heart"&gt;Why Inconsistent Sleep Hurts Your Heart&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What explains this connection? When sleep patterns vary widely, it causes circadian misalignment,  essentially throwing off the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/high-fat-diets-body-clock-obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body’s internal clock&lt;/a&gt;. This disruption can cascade into various physiological changes that stress the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These disruptions can lead to problems with glucose and lipid metabolism, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/diabetes-insulin-producing-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system, all factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Irregular sleep patterns were more common among certain groups in the study. People who reported &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health issues&lt;/a&gt;, those taking medications for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cholesterol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and individuals working night shifts were all more likely to have irregular sleep patterns. Current smokers also tended to have less regular sleep compared to non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recommendations about sleep duration have become common in recent years, with the American Heart Association even adding sleep duration to its “Life’s Essential 8” metrics for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/7-keys-to-sleep-health-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, but sleep regularity has received far less attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those looking to improve sleep regularity, experts suggest maintaining a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sleep-schedule-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;consistent sleep schedule&lt;/a&gt; (even on weekends), establishing a relaxing bedtime routine, and creating a sleep-conducive environment. How consistently we sleep may be just as important as how long we sleep—and for your heart’s sake, sticking to regular bedtimes might matter more than we previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a prospective cohort study using data from the UK Biobank, focusing on 72,269 adults aged 40-79 who wore wrist accelerometers for 7 days. They calculated a Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) for each participant using validated algorithms that measure consistency in sleep-wake patterns. Participants were categorized as having irregular sleep (SRI &amp;lt;71.6), moderately irregular sleep (SRI 71.6-87.3), or regular sleep (SRI &amp;gt;87.3). They also classified participants based on whether they met age-specific sleep duration recommendations (7-9 hours for ages 18-64, 7-8 hours for those 65+). Information on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was obtained from hospitalization and death records, with participants followed for an average of 7.8 years. The researchers excluded participants with previous history of MACE or who had an event in the first year of follow-up to reduce reverse causation. They used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for numerous confounders including age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, physical activity, screen time, diet, coffee intake, alcohol consumption, smoking, mental health, medication use, family history, shift work, and self-reported sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that irregular sleepers had a 26% higher risk of MACE (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.16-1.37) and moderately irregular sleepers had an 8% higher risk (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.70) compared to regular sleepers. When examining MACE subtypes, irregular sleep was associated with a 45% higher risk of heart failure, 23% higher risk of myocardial infarction, and 22% higher risk of stroke. The relationship between SRI and MACE risk was near-linear, with steeper risk reduction at higher SRI scores. An SRI score of at least 77.1 was associated with a 15% reduction in MACE risk. Joint analyses of sleep regularity and duration showed that meeting sleep duration recommendations offset MACE risk for moderately irregular sleepers (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.18), but not for irregular sleepers (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.35), indicating that adequate sleep duration cannot compensate for highly irregular sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study has several limitations. The UK Biobank had a low response rate (5.5%), which may affect representativeness of the broader population. Covariate assessments were conducted at a single time point rather than treated as time-varying factors, with a median lag of 5.5 years between baseline measurements and the accelerometry sub-study. While the study design allows for assessing associations, randomized experiments would be needed for stronger causal inference. Sleep was measured over only a single week, which may not fully capture long-term sleep patterns. The accelerometry method has limitations in distinguishing between quiet wakefulness and sleep, potentially leading to misclassification. Additionally, the SRI algorithm did not detect napping, only the longest sleep period of the day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource and funded through Dr. Stamatakis’ Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Investigator Grant. Several authors disclosed potential conflicts of interest: Dr. Cistulli has an endowed Academic Chair at the University of Sydney created from ResMed funding (though he receives no personal fees) and has received research support from ResMed, SomnoMed, and Bayer, and serves as consultant to these companies. Dr. Rajaratnam declared grants from Vanda Pharmaceuticals, WA Police, and the CDC, consulting fees from Roche and Circadian Therapeutics, honoraria from Roche, and holds a patent for a digital application for sleep in shift workers. Other authors declared no competing interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. We want you to love the meals you’re eating! If there’s a meal you don’t like, definitely feel free to substitute another option. In this meal plan, we aimed for about 1,500 calories, a minimum of 80 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber and a max of 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, as recommended by the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Check out more of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7952332/high-protein-high-fiber-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein, high-fiber dinner ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day, that works! Each breakfast option is between 338 and 364 calories while each lunch is between 355 and 430 calories. These ranges are fairly close and should be fine to swap out, or find another option entirely if that’s preferred. If you’re closely monitoring your calories, protein, fiber or other nutrients, you may want to be mindful to choose a swap with similar stats or adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What are the health benefits of fiber?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiber is a type of indigestible carbohydrate found in whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. It has many health benefits and has been tagged as our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053298/best-nutrient-for-weight-loss-according-to-gastroenterologist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;No. 1 nutrient for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, improved blood sugar levels and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber is probably best known for its role in helping to reduce constipation and regulate bowel movements, but it’s also an important nutrient for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item " data-ordinal="4"&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_161-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein and fiber both help us feel full, which can help with weight loss, but their mechanisms are different. Fiber is broken down slowly, meaning it stays in our digestive tract longer and promotes feelings of fullness. Soluble fiber hangs out in the large intestine, where it ferments and forms short-chain fatty acids that regulate appetite, influence fat storage and reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When protein is digested, satiety hormones that help us feel full are released and the hunger-inducing hormone, ghrelin, is suppressed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though their mechanisms are different, it’s clear that a routine that provides plenty of protein and fiber is a great tool for weight loss.

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has green-lit a blood test that can help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. It is the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" data-displayoverlay="displayOverlay" rel="noreferrer"&gt;first blood test to be cleared&lt;/a&gt; by the FDA for the disease, which affects more than 7 million older Americans and is marked by a decline in memory and thinking skills.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;The test, called Lumipulse, can detect abnormal clumps of protein in the brain, known as amyloid plaques. These plaques disrupt brain cell function and are a hallmark of &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/difference-between-dementia-alzheimers/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="dementia vs alzheimers"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;PET scans and spinal fluid tests can also detect amyloid plaques and have been used for years to help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s. But the tests are expensive and, in the case of the lumbar puncture, invasive. They can also be inaccessible for people in rural areas. Lumipulse, on the other hand, requires only a blood draw in patients 55 and older who are showing signs and symptoms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;“Having a blood test just makes it so much easier in being able to make a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,” said Charles Bernick, M.D., a neurologist with the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, based in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;In its news release, the test’s manufacturer, Fujirebio Diagnostics, didn’t specify the cost of the test.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;People without symptoms shouldn’t test &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;The newly approved blood test measures two proteins in the liquid part of the blood, known as plasma, and then calculates the ratio of these proteins, which is “correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient’s brain, reducing the need for a PET scan,” the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;The test is only meant for older adults who are experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease; &lt;a href="/health/brain-health/alzheimers-diagnosis-before-symptoms/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="alzheimer's diagnosis before symptoms"&gt;it is not a screening test&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, the FDA said, the results should be used along with “other clinical evaluations or additional tests” to determine treatment options. In addition to brain imaging and lumbar punctures, doctors often use neurological exams and cognitive tests, for example, &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/dementia-diagnosis/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="dementia diagnosis"&gt;to diagnose a patient&lt;/a&gt; with Alzheimer’s disease. “It still becomes a diagnosis where you have to really look at the whole picture,” Bernick said.&lt;/p&gt;

These drugs, which are given by infusion, don’t cure the disease but can help to slow the rate of decline in people in its early stages. Because they work by clearing amyloid plaques from the brain, the presence of amyloid must be confirmed before they can be prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;

During the inspection, a referee pointed something out to Gee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re like, ‘What’s that?’ I was like, ‘I don’t know. It’s just a spot I had since I was little,’” Gee, now 19, a biomedical engineering student at Texas A&amp;amp;M, tells TODAY.com. “They were like, ‘Well, we’ll let you wrestle this time, but you have to get it checked out.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gee visited a dermatologist and learned that the mole was cancerous. Soon after he was diagnosed with Stage 3 melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg" alt="Sam Gee"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Now almost 20, Sam Gee has been healthy since his treatment for melanoma at 15.

At the time, he was grappling with another unusual health change. About a month prior to tournament, Gee noticed a puffy bump in his upper right leg.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had some serious swelling,” he says. “I thought it was an inguinal hernia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Inguinal hernias occur when part of the intestine pokes through the abdomen near the groin and can look like a bump, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inguinal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351547" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. A visit with a pediatric surgeon revealed what it was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He was like, ‘It’s not a inguinal hernia, but likely a swollen lymph node,’” Gee recalls. “He’s like, ‘It’s just from puberty. … Come back in a few weeks if it hasn’t gone away.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gee then visited a doctor about the mole and underwent a biopsy, which revealed that he had melanoma. It had spread locally, causing the swollen lymph node in his leg. Doctors considered Mohs surgery, where skin is cut away layer by layer to remove the cancer with clear margins, but Gee needed immunotherapy first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the same time, school moved online as the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns had begun. That helped Gee manage some of the symptoms he experienced from immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I would get fatigued a little bit. It would make me nauseous,” he says. “It was a very day-to-day thing. Some days I would feel fantastic. Some days I would feel like I needed to throw up or I was really tired.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In January 2021, Gee underwent surgery and had the melanoma and lymph nodes removed. Following surgery, he completed several more rounds of immunotherapy before he finished treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was disease free,” he says. “That was when they said, ‘OK you’re cured.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Melanoma &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Melanoma occurs most often in “older white males,” and the average age of a patient with metastatic melanoma is in their 60s, says Dr. Hussein Tawbi. But it does occur in younger populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The No. 1 cause of cancer in women between age 30-40 is melanoma, for instance,” Tawbi, director of personalized cancer therapy in the department of melanoma medical oncology in the division of cancer medicine at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer center, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt; But “pediatric melanoma is relatively rare," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg" alt="Sam Gee"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since being diagnosed with melanoma, Sam Gee has become a 'total sunscreen freak.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Gee family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People often develop skin cancer, including melanoma, because of sun exposure. Tawbi urges people to start using sunscreen regularly in childhood, as sun exposure in adolescence and young adulthood increases the risk of metastatic melanoma later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a very direct relationship between sun exposure and a higher incidence of melanoma,” he says. "We do recommend people to start using sunscreen as early as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He also urges people to undergo regular visits to a dermatologist to undergo skin checks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Early diagnosis is still key,” Tawbi says. “If you find the melanoma early enough, it is still largely curable with surgery alone.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts talk about the ABCDEs of skin cancer to help assess if a mole or mark on the skin is cause for concern. Any of these qualities should prompt a visit to the doctor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: Asymmetry, when a mole doesn’t appear the same on both sides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;: Border, when the outside of the mole looks jagged or uneven&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;: Color, when the hue of the mole changes, becoming lighter, darker, white, red or blue &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;: Diameter, when a mole is larger than the size of a pencil eraser &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;: Evolution, when a mole changes or appears to be different &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Surgery can cure 95-99% of early melanomas, Tawbi notes. For those who have advanced stage melanomas, either Stage 3 or 4, immunotherapies can often extend lives. Since about 2010, checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy — a type of treatment that uses the body’s immune system to better fight cancer — have transformed melanoma treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“(They've) absolutely changed everything and started resulting for long-term survival for patients,” Tawbi says. “The survival for melanoma has actually increased by 10-fold.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Before checkpoint inhibitors, the median survival time for metastatic melanomas like Gee's was seven months. Now it is 72 months, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s pretty pretty impressive,” he says. “The only way we got patients to have better survival rates in the last 10 years has been purely through research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;"Total sunscreen freak"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Before being diagnosed with cancer, Gee thought he would pursue electrical engineering or computer science. After his experience as a patient and seeing how technology improves medicine, he’s majoring in biomedical engineering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Seeing all those cool machines and wanting to make those threw me into biomed engineering,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Today, he’s a “total sunscreen freak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg" alt="Sam Gee"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since being diagnosed with melanoma at 15, Sam Gee always uses sunscreen to protect himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Gee family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m all about the sunscreen now,” he says. “I hope people will start wearing their sunscreen. … That’s really what I want to get across is wear sunscreen, don’t tan on purpose.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gee also hopes his story helps other young men with melanoma feel less isolated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“You really don’t see that too much.

recorded more than double the number of Lyme disease cases in 2024 as it did in 2020 - 7,200 compared to 3,110. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And so far this year, the state health department has reported 1,517 cases of tick-borne illnesses and 349 tick-related emergency room visits from January 1 to May 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an increase from 288 hospital visits during the same time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person contracts Lyme disease from the bite of an infected black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, which is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13468953/Worst-states-tick-borne-illnesses.html"&gt;a common species in the Northeast and Midwest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lyme disease signs usually begin with the hallmark 'bullseye' rash that has red rings around the original bite site. If left untreated people may experience flu-like symptoms like a headache, muscle pains and aches and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe untreated cases of Lyme disease can cause facial paralysis, vision changes and issues with memory and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A person contracts Lyme disease from the bite of an infected black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, pictured above (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lyme disease cases in the US are on the rise, with cases hitting a high of of 89,470 in 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness is easier to treat when caught early and doctors typically prescribe a 28-day regimen of antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, because of the non-specific symptoms of Lyme disease, many cases can go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally, ticks must be attached to a person for at least 24 hours in order to transmit the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Performing tick checks after possible exposure is vital to quickly identify if you've been bitten and to remove the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer ticks are common in northeastern and midwestern states, such as Connecticut, New York, Minnesota and Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC, which has Lyme disease data through 2023, shows New Jersey had the fourth-highest number of Lyme disease cases that year, falling behind New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It recorded 7,224 cases. New York saw 22,170 cases; Pennsylvania reported 16,670; and Massachusetts reported 9,715. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the US is seeing a record number of Lyme disease cases - recording 89,470 cases in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease area is also expanding.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map of where Lyme disease cases were reported in the US in 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map of where Lyme disease cases were reported in the US in 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map of where Lyme disease cases were reported in the US in 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent testing on human and tick samples suggests millions more Americans could be at risk because the tick that causes Lyme disease is spreading to new geographical areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts don't know exactly why the tick is traveling, but some posit it is due to development or climate change, and cases could be on the rise because of increased education and awareness surrounding ticks and Lyme disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid Lyme disease, it is important to wear long sleeves and long pants to prevent ticks from being able to attach themselves to your skin and perform thorough tick checks after spending time in the outdoors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You can also wear repellant and treat clothing with acaricides, special pesticides used to kill ticks and mites.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ticks can also infect animals, so it is important to check pets for the parasites or signs of a bite and give them preventatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you do find a tick, use tweezers to remove it and save it so it can be identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We asked experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-motion-sickness" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is motion sickness?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Motion sickness is a generic term that encompasses all sorts of travel sickness, including sea sickness, air sickness and car sickness, says Dr John Golding, professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster, in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But you don’t need to travel to experience its unpleasant symptoms, which can include nausea, vomiting, burping, drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and blurred vision. When the Lumière brothers first screened a motion picture for the public in 1895, some people in the audience started feeling dizzy and sick, says Golding. This is known as “visually induced motion sickness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="dc137228-1ee0-4d21-bf7f-08a6dc5c4f4e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Athletes and fitness influencers use creatine, but what is it?

Your body uses visual stimuli, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/18/the-power-of-proprioception-how-to-improve-your-sixth-sense-and-become-healthier-and-happier" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;proprioception&lt;/a&gt; (the body’s ability to perceive itself in space) and the vestibular system (structures inside the inner ear that help you maintain a sense of balance) to sense where your body is and how it is moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Usually, these three mechanisms are in sync. But when one of them isn’t – say, you’re reading a static page in the car, but your vestibular system still senses that you’re moving – this sensory conflict confuses the brain. “This neurological tension is what triggers common symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and vomiting,” explains Dr Safia Debar, a general practitioner and executive health physician at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the case of the Lumière brothers’ first audiences, their vestibular systems and senses of proprioception told them they were still, but their eyes told them they were moving. Today, many people experience this sort of visually induced motion sickness when using virtual-reality headsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-kinds-of-movements-cause-motion-sickness" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What kinds of movements cause motion sickness?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One of the most common misconceptions about motion sickness is that the strength of the movement determines the severity of the reaction, says Golding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But people don’t tend to get motion sickness when they’re bouncing up and down on horseback; that is a “higher frequency” movement, says Golding. Slower-frequency movements, like the rocking of a ship at sea, or the swaying of a bus, are more likely to result in motion sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-do-some-people-experience-motion-sickness-more-than-others" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why do some people experience motion sickness more than others?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So why can one person read endlessly in a car while even a quick glimpse at a phone turns another person green?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A number of factors seem to influence one’s proneness to motion sickness, says Dr Behrang Keshavarz, senior scientist at the Kite Research Institute and professor in the department of psychology at Toronto Metropolitan University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One is age: motion sickness tends to peak in children between the ages of 8 and 12. “Adults are usually better than kids with motion sickness,” says Keshavarz. But that’s not true for everyone, he clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Research suggests people assigned female at birth are more likely to experience motion sickness than those assigned male at birth, says Keshavarz, though no one’s quite sure why. Genetics may also play a role, says Golding, adding that studies indicate motion sickness might be 50-70% heritable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"d493857e-ede7-4ad1-8084-f39fbf3be02b","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="d493857e-ede7-4ad1-8084-f39fbf3be02b" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some individuals may also be better at adapting to strange new motions than others, suggests Dr Thomas A Stoffregen, emeritus professor of kinesiology at the University of Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some people are ‘naturally coordinated’ and can learn new motor skills quickly,” he says over email. “Others (like me) are klutzes and take forever to learn new movements.” The latter are more at risk for motion sickness, he argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-21" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(I would like to see this printed on the little airplane vomit bags I so often end up breathing into during landings.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s not about being delicate or anxious,” says Debar. “Some people are simply more sensitive to motion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About half of novice astronauts get space sick during training, Golding adds. “They’re very fit, very highly motivated and not weak-willed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I nod.

Sit in the front seat of a car when you can, keep your eyes on the horizon, and avoid reading and screens, says Debar. She also notes that ginger has some natural anti-nausea effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pleasant music, fresh air, nice smells and a generally pleasant ambiance may be able to distract you, says Keshavarz. He also suggests car passengers copy the movements of the driver. Drivers rarely get motion sickness because they can anticipate the movements of the car and lean into turns, for example. “If you mimic what the driver does, that helps,” Keshavarz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unfortunately, the most effective way to combat motion sickness is also the least pleasant: habituation. In other words, doing the activity over and over again until it doesn’t give you motion sickness anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is by far the most effective countermeasure,” says Golding, who used it to help desensitize Royal Air Force pilots to air sickness. “It doesn’t have side effects, but it’s very time consuming and can be stimulus specific,” he says – meaning that habituating to car sickness won’t necessarily help you with sea sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over-the-counter anti-nausea medication can be effective, experts say, but they often cause drowsiness. Transdermal patches such as Scopolamine are also helpful for up to three days, but can take six to 10 hours to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Timing is important for such medications, says Golding. Even pills might take 30 minutes to an hour to take effect. And you must take them before you start to feel sick, because once you start to experience motion sickness, your stomach goes into gastric stasis, meaning it is no longer emptying its contents into the gut. “That means you might have taken the pill, but it’s not going anywhere,” says Golding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Finally, you can always “vote with your feet”, says Golding. “Avoid situations where you get sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOSHZLUldIT1puQXN1NFZ3OUdDdThPYjN4NjZGVE8wWF8yTk1xRXhNcEUxS3dyR3M3ZE91V0RScDF6WTdHQ1JXeWxqSGctdUVHdTJvN0JYOUpCWXNuOFZ6MzZ0bUtZWVZFVkx0VmZIZXdhSkZfbEpCWnd6RndhRGJBVFNR</guid></item><item><title>马萨诸塞州布里格姆将军的研究发现，常见的止痛药可能会延长脑癌患者的生存期-《波士顿环球报》 | Common pain drug may prolong survival for brain cancer patients, Mass General Brigham study finds - The Boston Globe</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxONUU3eVJJSGF0TWdaZF9rYVBOLW5IajdKQ3hkNTJUQkRvcFR3Ni11b1E4cWc4eHA2Q3B1bi10UWRSNndGd1dxbjk2RzY1aUtBNGtobEdSei0zeFBwODJLNjVmMUxyWENVQ0hYelJNaTExSVRYRnFuTnZSMnRqUUREMEktdmJOQjdrZ0FzRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="lead | border_box gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet relative"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A widely prescribed medication may offer new hope for patients battling glioblastoma, an aggressive tumor that accounts for the majority of malignant brain cancers in adults and carries one of the bleakest prognoses in oncology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Patients who took gabapentin — a drug commonly used to treat nerve pain and seizures — lived several months longer than those who didn’t, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59614-4" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59614-4"&gt;a new study published this week in Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The findings come from a retrospective analysis by research teams at Mass General Brigham and the University of California, San Francisco. Glioblastoma affects about 12,000 Americans each year, and despite ongoing research, survival rates have barely improved: most patients die within 12 to 14 months of diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The idea for the study emerged from its lead author, Dr. Joshua Bernstock, and what he called his “emerging obsession” with cancer neuroscience — a growing field that examines how tumors manipulate the nervous system to grow and survive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In 2023, researchers on the West Coast published a study showing that gliomas — a broad category of brain tumors that includes glioblastoma — integrate into neural circuits and use a protein called thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) to fuel their growth. Bernstock knew that gabapentin was shown in earlier research to interfere with TSP-1 activity, and was struck by the potential implications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I looked at it three times the day it came out and said, ‘Oh my God,’” said Bernstock, a clinical fellow in neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “This wasn’t some novel experimental therapy. This was something already on the shelf, already being prescribed to patients.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bernstock’s team combed through the medical records of 693 glioblastoma patients treated at Mass General Brigham. Many had been prescribed gabapentin to treat chronic nerve pain. Those patients had a median survival of 16 months — four months longer than those not on the drug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To test whether the trend held up elsewhere, the team partnered with UC San Francisco researchers who reviewed data from 379 additional patients. Their results showed an even greater gap: patients taking gabapentin lived 20.8 months on average, compared to 14.7 months for those who didn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bernstock emphasized that while the findings are promising, only a randomized clinical trial can confirm gabapentin’s true effect. But the biology supports the hypothesis. Patients who took gabapentin showed lower levels of TSP-1 in their blood, and the team controlled for as many confounding variables as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We know it’s biologically plausible,” Bernstock said. “That, plus the drop in serum [found in blood] TSP-1, makes us think this is the probable mechanism.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He hopes the data will justify launching prospective trials — some of which are already in the early stages of recruitment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Glioblastoma’s resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, combined with its highly heterogeneous nature — meaning no two tumors are exactly alike, even within the same patient — has stalled progress for decades and made breakthroughs rare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This is just such a challenging disease,” Bernstock said. “Gradual steps forward are going to be meaningful.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Even a few extra months can be life-changing for patients and their families.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You haven’t seen these people in clinic,” Bernstock said. “You’ve never had a father who wants to see his daughter graduate, or a mom who wants to help get the family’s affairs in order before she passes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Those human stories, he added, are what drives him to keep searching for new answers in the lab. “It’s actually horrifying to sit across from someone and know you can’t help them with what’s conventionally available,” he said. “That’s what motivates me to keep pushing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

However, the protein craze could mean we’re eating too much for our own good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s always been trends around foods that are extreme,” physiologist George Wells, Ph.D., told &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;. “We had low fat, then low sugar, and now we happen to have high protein. The extremes tend to catch people’s attention. But they’re not good for us and they never last.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the protein craze, we’re pushing an important nutrient to the side: fiber. Accredited Practicing Dietitian Kim Lindsay says fiber is ignored because carbohydrates have been demonized and feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When there's a trend towards a low-carb, higher protein, if we're reducing the amount of carbohydrates that we're eating, we're going to naturally reduce the amount of fiber that we're taking in, right?” Lindsay explained. “We have to have a balanced &lt;a href="/topic/diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; where we include plant foods, protein-containing foods, and fats in our diet.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, balance is being pushed aside for protein-rich eggs, meat and seafood. Snacks previously called “junk food” are getting a wellness makeover, with added protein now found in many bars, chips and gummies. Even the Kardashians are on board, with Khloe Kardashian recently &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJEfXdrpOO_/"&gt;launching her protein popcorn&lt;/a&gt;, “Kloud,” which offers seven grams of protein per one cup of popcorn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://foodinsight.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-IFIC-Food-Health-Survey.pdf"&gt;The International Food Information Council’s annual survey&lt;/a&gt; found that 71 percent of consumers were trying to increase their protein intake this year, a 6 percent rise from 2023. The survey also found that exposure to food and nutrition content online, much of which is protein focused, is up by 54 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, protein is an essential macronutrient to help bodily functions, like fighting infection, providing energy, and building and maintaining muscle mass. Intake depends on body weight, with general guidance being that a just over a third of the calories we consume each day should come from protein. So, with the average American woman weighing around 171 pounds, she should consume about 62 grams of protein a day. The average American man, at around 200 pounds, should eat about 72 grams of protein daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 dcuwoN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-84388"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;(Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Wells believes that due to social media, we’re only focused on having as much protein as possible. “I think the craze around protein right now probably is linked to bodybuilding and the obsession with body composition — looking like you have the six-pack abs,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that ignores the flip side. “If you have too much protein, it's really hard for the body to deal with all of the amino acids that are floating around,” Wells added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where fiber comes in handy. Typically found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, fiber is particularly beneficial to your digestive system and keeping you regular. While men should have about 38 grams a day and women should have 25 grams, as noted by dietitian Kristin Kirkpatrick, you shouldn’t just jump into doing that if you’ve been eating way less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber intake should be tailored to the individual and the microbiome. However, if you are well under this amount, you should go slow to allow the body adequate time to adjust,” Kirkpatrick, the owner of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kristinkirkpatrick.com/"&gt;KAK nutrition consulting,&lt;/a&gt; explained. She added that fiber can also prevent certain cancers and type 2 diabetes and improve heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 gTGbNB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-84389"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;(Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational studies have found a fiber deficiency among Americans. According to a study published in &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6124841/#bibr10-1559827615588079"&gt;the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, only five percent of the population has the recommended amount of fiber a day. Inadequate intake can result in health issues like chronic constipation and gastrointestinal problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to avoiding high-processed foods just because they’ve got extra protein added to them, we should focus on eating real foods that are naturally high in fiber rather than ultra-processed foods with bits of fiber in them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We gravitate towards highly processed foods because they're engineered to taste fantastic,” Wells said. ”They're high in sugar and salts, and we crave them as a result. There’s no real incentive for the processed foods to be satiating. They're great for business, but they're really not very good for our health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 15:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOVWJ1d3h3MkxQYUJIbjFoNDlaRFpJZlFwNXhPbkRnOFV3eE9aaXlSZ1l4YWY4MEY3V3VZcEFBR25WVFB0dlg2WEYxc1pXdVhSMkhOcUl2bEYyMGZQN0ZsMGUxTU9ub1FUWHhWaUVtTEk3Qkd5b1N6V2sxSDlmNlRiTTBiSVM3dEhtRGg0OGpFVjU4SVdqZERDNy1CMGVyRDh3dmsxSlMxeGJMY2dPdmZJ</guid></item><item><title>想活到115岁吗？以下是研究表明您应该做的事情-神经科学新闻 | Want to Live to 115?

Though we can’t control our genetics, these findings highlight daily habits that can help stack the odds in our favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Just 75 minutes of brisk walking per week can add two years to your life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy Diets Promote Aging Well:&lt;/strong&gt; Diets rich in plants, whole grains, and healthy fats are linked to disease-free aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Connection Counts:&lt;/strong&gt; Older adults with daily social interaction are 3x more likely to live five more years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 115-year-old Surrey woman named Ethel Caterham has officially been handed the title of the oldest living human alive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people reading this news may wonder what Caterham’s secret is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110134"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows older ladies." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/longevity-habits-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Although it’s hard to tease out the role of genetics versus lifestyle when it comes to lifespan, current predictions suggest that longevity is between 20-40% related to genetics. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it isn’t usually a good idea to take health and longevity advice from supercentenarians (as they’re often the exception rather than the rule), there are some lifestyle pointers that we can take from research on groups of long-lived people that might help us increase our chances of living a longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Physical activity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is good for you – who knew? Research shows that people who are more physically active each day tend to live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study found that going from no physical activity to about 75 minutes per week of brisk walking increased life expectancy by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23139642/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;about two years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps less well known is just how bad inactivity is for your health and longevity. It’s a tad difficult to explain, but the positive effects of exercise are actually different from the negative effects of inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that you can have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3419586/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;positive influence on your health&lt;/a&gt; by being both more active and avoiding being inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet as good as structured exercise is for you, it can’t by itself offset the harms of inactivity and sitting all day. Research even shows that being sedentary is associated with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38410939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher risk of premature death&lt;/a&gt; from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to live longer, you should try to avoid sitting for long periods of time if possible. Practical tips for this include standing up every 30 minutes, going to see someone in the office instead of calling or emailing them and standing on public transport during commuting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, plus the aim to do about 30 minutes moderate exercise most days will help maximise your odds of a long, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Eat your veggies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice many kids dread: eat your vegetables if you want to live a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40128348/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; that followed around 100,000 people over a 30 year period found that people who made it to 70 years of age in good health (meaning they had no chronic diseases) typically ate more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, and fewer trans-fats, red or processed meats, fried foods and sugary foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this study doesn’t say that you must be a vegan, or never eat red meats – it only identifies trends within diets associated with healthy ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When and how much you eat may also play a role when it comes to ageing. Research on caloric restriction and intermittent fasting in animals has shown both can increase lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our preliminary work in humans has also shown that following a fasting diet for three weeks can cause &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10650498/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;similar, positive metabolic shifts&lt;/a&gt; that match what we’ve seen in animals that will live longer. However, larger studies over longer time-frames are needed to establish effects on healthspan and lifespan in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular, good quality sleep is also important for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37831896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lifelong health and overall longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study of about 500,000 British people, irregular sleep patterns were associated with a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37995126/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;50% higher risk of early death&lt;/a&gt; compared to those with regular sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shift workers showed higher risk for strokes, and nurses who worked rotating shifts for decades were &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9069254/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;less healthy and had earlier deaths&lt;/a&gt; at retirement compared to nurses who didn’t work shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this data suggests that good quality, regular sleep is important for good health, how much sleep you need and when you should go to bed &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8063933/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;appears to be highly individualistic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes giving population-wide recommendations difficult – which is why the NHS recommends adults get between 7-9 hours sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress has many effects on your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, increasing evidence shows that early-life stressors (such as loss of a parent, neglect or abuse) can negatively affect health later in life – even down to a molecular and cellular level by &lt;a href="https://karger.com/nim/article/32/1/24/916732/A-Brief-Historic-Review-of-Research-on-Early-Life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;increasing inflammation levels&lt;/a&gt; in ways that could increase the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6146930/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risk of poor health and premature death in older age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, older adults that show increased psychological resilience to stress are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39054517/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;less likely to die from any cause&lt;/a&gt;. As little as eight weeks of regular yoga is enough to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596549/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;improve psychological resilience&lt;/a&gt; in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly linked is the effect of social connections. Those that live more socially active lives also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11872968/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tend to live longer&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, people over 65 who are socially active daily are &lt;a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/77/5/277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;three times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to live for five more years compared to those that almost never engage in social activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a common finding that strong social networks appear to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473615/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;enhance longevity&lt;/a&gt;. This may be due to the way social connections help us alleviate stressors in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The role of genetics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are many lifestyle habits we can change, one thing we can’t control when it comes to our lifespans is genetics. Some research suggests that naturally-occurring mutations in genes associated with longevity are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20868776/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more common in long-lived people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s hard to tease out the role of genetics versus lifestyle when it comes to lifespan, current predictions suggest that longevity is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16708071/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;between 20-40%&lt;/a&gt; related to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28689042/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But good genetics aren’t everything. Although Ethel Caterham has made it to the remarkable age of 115 – and one of her sisters lived to be 104 – Caterham’s two daughters pre-deceased her at 71 and 83 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even if you do win the genetic jackpot and follow a good lifestyle, you would still be very lucky to make it to Caterham’s grand old age of 115. Cells mutate, clots form, biological luck runs out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, if you want to maximise your odds of living longer and staying as healthy as possible, aim to be more physically active each day, eat a good diet, get a good night’s sleep and keep stress levels low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this longevity and aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/bradley-elliott-1014864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bradley Elliott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bradley Elliott – The Conversation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255789/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 15:26:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5NcHYtcnlkNVhKRDhHeFBUZ3B4anhfaXJwc08xTUV2ZFBBdmd2LXRsRFlpU3hDUFNnTENKR1VCN1VoazNIanZYNEFyRXdaenlTUl9jMXJYQVBqNjM5Z1pCVTZsdUp0bmpWaGdBemJwUG8</guid></item><item><title>重新布线记忆：像人脑一样学习的新模型-神经科学新闻 | Rewiring Memory: A New Model That Learns Like a Human Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXkFVX3lxTE9rMm9qTXRTNENLbVNxZWtuOGZNWjZQeWdXRjVOeDRSWk81NWwySFlmc3k1TnBMNGZNaW5KMjF0MFBManVPN19COFlWdWlILWpkUzNTSVpobS1KanJqeUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new memory model called Input-Driven Plasticity (IDP) offers a more human-like explanation for how external stimuli help us retrieve memories, building on the foundations of the classic Hopfield network. Unlike traditional models, which assume memory recall happens from a fixed starting point, the IDP framework describes how stimuli reshape the brain’s “energy landscape” in real time to guide memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic approach better reflects how we remember things in real life, like recognizing a cat from just its tail. The model is also robust to noise, filtering out weak memories in favor of stable, meaningful ones, offering insights for future AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Memory Retrieval:&lt;/strong&gt; The IDP model suggests that external stimuli reshape the neural landscape as memories are retrieved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise-Resilient Design:&lt;/strong&gt; It uses environmental “noise” to filter out unstable memories, improving robustness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; This model could inspire more memory-capable AI systems that go beyond static inputs and mimic human associative recall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Santa Barbara&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to the first notes of an old, beloved song.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a network effect,” said UC Santa Barbara mechanical engineering professor Francesco Bullo, explaining that associative memories aren’t stored in single brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memory storage and memory retrieval are dynamic processes that occur over entire networks of neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1982 physicist John Hopfield translated this theoretical neuroscience concept into the artificial intelligence realm, with the formulation of the Hopfield network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, not only did he provide a mathematical framework for understanding memory storage and retrieval in the human brain, he also developed one of the first recurrent artificial neural networks — the Hopfield network — known for its ability to retrieve complete patterns from noisy or incomplete inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopfield won the Nobel Prize for his work in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to Bullo and collaborators Simone Betteti, Giacomo Baggio and Sandro Zampieri at the University of Padua in Italy, the traditional Hopfield network model is powerful, but it doesn’t tell the full story of how new information guides memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Notably,” they say in a paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, “the role of external inputs has largely been unexplored, from their effects on neural dynamics to how they facilitate effective memory retrieval.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest a model of memory retrieval they say is more descriptive of how we experience memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The modern version of machine learning systems, these large language models — they don’t really model memories,” Bullo explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You put in a prompt and you get an output. But it’s not the same way in which we understand and handle memories in the animal world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While LLMs can return responses that can sound convincingly intelligent, drawing upon the patterns of the language they are fed, they still lack the underlying reasoning and experience of the physical real world that animals have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way in which we experience the world is something that is more continuous and less start-and-reset,” said Betteti, lead author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the treatments on the Hopfield model tended to treat the brain as if it was a computer, he added, with a very mechanistic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, since we are working on a memory model, we want to start with a human perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main question inspiring the theorists was: As we experience the world that surrounds us, how do the signals we receive enable us to retrieve memories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hopfield envisioned, it helps to conceptualize memory retrieval in terms of an energy landscape, in which the valleys are energy minima that represent memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory retrieval is like exploring this landscape; recognition is when you fall into one of the valleys. Your starting position in the landscape is your initial condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine you see a cat’s tail,” Bullo said. “Not the entire cat, but just the tail. An associative memory system should be able to recover the memory of the entire cat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the traditional Hopfield model, the cat’s tail (stimulus) is enough to put you closest to the valley labeled “cat,” he explained, treating the stimulus as an initial condition. But how did you get to that spot in the first place? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The classic Hopfield model does not carefully explain how seeing the tail of the cat puts you in the right place to fall down the hill and reach the energy minimum,” Bullo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you move around in the space of neural activity where you are storing these memories? It’s a little bit unclear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ Input-Driven Plasticity (IDP) model aims to address this lack of clarity with a mechanism that gradually integrates past and new information, guiding the memory retrieval process to the correct memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of applying the two-step algorithmic memory retrieval on the rather static energy landscape of the original Hopfield network model, the researchers describe a dynamic, input-driven mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We advocate for the idea that as the stimulus from the external world is received (e.g., the image of the cat tail), it changes the energy landscape at the same time,” Bullo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The stimulus simplifies the energy landscape so that no matter what your initial position, you will roll down to the correct memory of the cat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the researchers say, the IDP model is robust to noise — situations where the input is vague, ambiguous, or partially obscured — and in fact uses the noise as a means to filter out less stable memories (the shallower valleys of this energy landscape) in favor of the more stable ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We start with the fact that when you’re gazing at a scene your gaze shifts in between the different components of the scene,” Betteti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So at every instant in time you choose what you want to focus on but you have a lot of noise around.” Once you lock into the input to focus on, the network adjusts itself to prioritize it, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing what stimulus to focus on, a.k.a. attention, is also the main mechanism behind another neural network architecture, the transformer, which has become the heart of large language models like ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the IDP model the researchers propose “starts from a very different initial point with a different aim,” Bullo said, there’s a lot of potential for the model to be helpful in designing future machine learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see a connection between the two, and the paper describes it,” Bullo said. “It is not the main focus of the paper, but there is this wonderful hope that these associative memory systems and large language models may be reconciled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#592a36373038773f3c2b3738373d3c23192c3a2a3b773c3d2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sonia Fernandez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsb.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Santa Barbara&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sonia Fernandez – UC Santa Barbara&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adu6991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Input-Driven Dynamics for Robust Memory Retrieval in Hopfield Networks&lt;/a&gt;” by Francesco Bullo et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input-Driven Dynamics for Robust Memory Retrieval in Hopfield Networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hopfield model provides a mathematical framework for understanding the mechanisms of memory storage and retrieval in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model has inspired decades of research on learning and retrieval dynamics, capacity estimates, and sequential transitions among memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the role of external inputs has been largely underexplored, from their effects on neural dynamics to how they facilitate effective memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bridge this gap, we propose a dynamical system framework in which the external input directly influences the neural synapses and shapes the energy landscape of the Hopfield model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plasticity-based mechanism provides a clear energetic interpretation of the memory retrieval process and proves effective at correctly classifying mixed inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we integrate this model within the framework of modern Hopfield architectures to elucidate how current and past information are combined during the retrieval process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, we embed both the classic and the proposed model in an environment disrupted by noise and compare their robustness during memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to examine the association between two vitamin D biomarkers (25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and vitamin D-binding protein [DBP], and their related genetic correlates) and the risk of six mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a population-based, case-cohort sample of all individuals born in Denmark between 1981 and 2005. Using Danish health registers with follow-up to Dec 31, 2012, we identified individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, ASD, and anorexia nervosa based on ICD-10 criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a random subcohort from the general population was selected. Based on neonatal dried blood spots, we measured concentrations of 25(OH)D and DBP. Our primary analyses were based on hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI and absolute risks for the six mental disorders according to measured concentrations of 25(OH)D and DBP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As secondary analyses, we examined the association between genetic predictors of 25(OH)D and DBP, and the six mental disorders, and Mendelian randomisation analyses based on published summary statistics for 25(OH)D, DBP, and the six mental disorders. People with lived experience contributed to the development of the guiding hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the total population from the iPSYCH2012 design (n=88 764), which included individuals who developed the six mental disorders, major depressive disorder (n=24 240), bipolar disorder (n=1928), schizophrenia (n=3540), ADHD (n=18 726), ASD (n=16 146), anorexia nervosa (n=3643), and the randomly sampled subcohort (n=30 000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who met a range of inclusion criteria (eg, measured 25[OH]D, DBP or genotype, and predominantly European ancestry), we measured 25(OH)D or DBP in 71 793 individuals (38 118 [53·1%] male and 33 675 [46·9%] female); 65 952 had 25(OH)D and 66 797 the DBP measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant inverse relationships were found between 25(OH)D and schizophrenia (HR 0·82, 95% CI 0·78–0·86), ASD (HR 0·93, 95% CI 0·90–0·96), and ADHD (HR 0·89, 95% CI 0·86–0·92). A significant inverse relationship was found between DBP and schizophrenia (HR 0·84, 95% CI 0·80–0·88).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on polygenic risk scores, higher concentrations of 25(OH)D (adjusted for DBP) were significantly associated with a reduced risk of both ASD and schizophrenia. Analyses based on Mendelian randomisation provided support for a causal association between both lower 25(OH)D and DBP concentrations and an increased risk of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convergent evidence finds that neonatal vitamin D status is associated with an altered risk of mental disorders. Our study supports the hypothesis that optimising neonatal vitamin D status might reduce the incidence of a range of neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Danish National Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 14:33:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE52MEhoeVB1MnpvQWQ3b2tBeHpRSmtEN0hRcGhUdWhCb1l0aEVRT2lnTkg3MVZUWHpJSTI3RjJ1ZjhoM2dMVGhwcWJlLWQtMlRKWlZrV3pnc01JTUptTmt4TlB4SVRsYWJmTlE</guid></item><item><title>维生素B12会损害肾脏吗？定期服用这种补充剂之前需要知道的5件事-印度时报 | Can vitamin B12 damage kidneys? 5 things to know before regularly taking this supplement - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, B12 injections have become trendy. They’re advertised for fatigue, weight loss, and even skin glow. But when used without medical guidance, they can quietly stress the kidneys — especially when high doses enter the bloodstream directly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A single B12 shot can contain 500 to 1000 mcg or more, going straight into circulation, bypassing the digestive filter. If the kidneys are already under strain (which is common with age, diabetes, or high blood pressure), this direct load can be too much to handle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctors usually prescribe B12 shots for genuine deficiencies like pernicious anemia or malabsorption disorders. Without these, relying on shots becomes more of a health experiment than a need.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，如果您患有IBS ，您应该开始的# 1习惯- EatingWell | The #1 Habit You Should Start If You Have IBS, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBCcVBHT2hRUjc2STlzUW5xaHdKUXRWNEMzeXZJNnktX2tQOVZCYkVmZ0Rya0JyNm5NZkRYREJiM2NUczJWOVZDMzhIQ0hPTl9XNU1DdTJOSkVpSVBILVh5YXlsbm5Idm5YSTY3cGpQVVpaRmtKTFFpNDR2V0hjMUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with IBS have uncomfortable digestive symptoms like diarrhea, constipation or both.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To ease discomfort, many people cut out certain foods, robbing them of key nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say a better first step is slowing down during meals to improve digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A diagnosis of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-experts-recommend-when-diagnosed-with-ibs-8746518" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&lt;/a&gt; may have you flipping your diet upside down trying to manage symptoms. “Too many people with IBS start by excluding foods,” says&lt;a href="http://www.guthealthconnection.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Kim Kulp, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Many try cutting out dairy or gluten, and when that doesn’t help, other foods are also eliminated. This can lead to a diet that’s lacking in a variety of nutrients, and still doesn’t manage symptoms.” So, this may not be the most effective first step toward feeling your best. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Instead, dietitians say, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you eat when you have IBS may be as important—if not more important—than &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs-11732962#:~:text=Nutrition%20experts%20agree%20that%20personalized,breathing%20exercises%20and%20eating%20slowly." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;what you eat&lt;/a&gt;. “As a dietitian specializing in IBS, one habit that I am constantly working with clients on is slowing down—especially at mealtimes,” says &lt;a href="https://rootstorisenutrition.com/about-kara/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kara Hochreiter, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. And her colleagues agree. Whether you have IBS-C, IBS-D or mixed IBS, here’s how slowing down while you eat may help improve your IBS symptoms. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-slowing-down-at-mealtimes-may-help-ibs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Slowing Down at Mealtimes May Help IBS &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Can Improve Gut-Brain Communication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re eating in a stressed or rushed state, digestion can take a serious hit, thanks to the strong two-way connection between your gut and your brain. When you’re under stress, your brain shifts energy and blood flow toward vital organs and away from your digestive system. If you eat in this state, your digestion may slow down or become disrupted. Then, your gut sends those stress signals right back to your brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For those who already struggle with IBS symptoms, the effects of stress can be even worse. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Help You Tune into Your Body’s Stress Signals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that people with IBS may be more likely to rush through meals and chew their food less thoroughly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When you’re eating in a rushed, distracted state, your body stays in fight-or-flight mode, which suppresses stomach acid, enzyme production and gut motility. This can result in more bloating, cramping, heartburn and unpredictable bowel movements,” says Hochreiter. Taking the time to slow down when you eat may help you better pick up on these signals before they escalate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, this may be more easily said than done, since experiencing pain and discomfort after eating can likely exacerbate stress. “People with IBS are more likely to experience stress and anxiety around food because they know their history of food and gut symptoms, which continues the cycle of visceral hypersensitivity when eating,” says&lt;a href="http://www.nicoleibarrard.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Nicole Ibarra, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Might Improve Digestion &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Something as simple as limiting distractions, chewing thoroughly and taking a few deep belly breaths before meals can help shift the body into rest-and-digest mode and dramatically reduce symptoms,” says Hochreiter. Planning plenty of time for your meals can also help. While it’s hard to do when you’re busy, dedicating 20 to 30 minutes for each meal may help you feel better after eating. Of course, long-term habits can be hard to break. If you could use more tips to help you slow down, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041411/how-to-eat-slower/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;these strategies can help&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to working closely with your physician or a registered dietitian, experts recommend these top IBS management strategies to feel your best. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep a food-and-symptom journal. &lt;/strong&gt;Journaling what you eat and any symptoms you feel can help you identify potential triggers to better inform you before you start cutting foods out of your diet. “It’s one of the most powerful tools for taking control of symptoms and feeling better day to day,” says &lt;a href="https://healthdownsouth.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jessie Winstead, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated.&lt;/strong&gt; Dehydration can slow digestion and make symptoms like constipation and gas worse. And, if you have IBS-D, staying hydrated is essential for replenishing lost fluids. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid skipping meals.&lt;/strong&gt; Going too long between meals can send your nervous and digestive systems into overdrive. “Eating every three to four hours helps balance [the stress hormone] cortisol and your circadian rhythm, while preventing overeating and impulsively eating foods that are gut-irritating,” says &lt;a href="https://www.thirdeyenourishment.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Keelin Murphy, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add gentle movement.&lt;/strong&gt; Just a 10- to 15-minute walk after a meal can help stimulate digestion and relieve numerous symptoms of IBS. In one small study, a short walk reduced burping, gas and abdominal pain as much as taking gut motility-stimulating medication. Plus, it relieved feelings of bloating and abdominal fullness at an even higher rate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat breakfast.&lt;/strong&gt; “This early meal kick-starts digestion by triggering the gastrocolic reflex, which promotes regular bowel movements and supports smoother gut function all day,” says &lt;a href="https://eatswimwin.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Katie Schimmelpfenning, RD&lt;/a&gt;. “It also provides steady energy and reduces stress on your digestive system, both key for managing IBS.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice relaxation techniques.&lt;/strong&gt; “To calm the gut, we must first calm the whole system by incorporating habits that help to shift the body into parasympathetic ‘rest and digest’ mode,” says Hochreiter. “Breathwork, meditation, gentle movement like yoga or tai chi, and vagus nerve stimulation (like humming or gargling) are all simple yet powerful tools to help support that process.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re dealing with IBS, what you eat matters. But how you eat might matter even more. Simple changes like slowing down, chewing your food thoroughly and eating in a relaxing environment can go a long way in improving brain-gut communication, reducing stress, supporting better digestion and calming your symptoms. Combine this simple habit with personalized recommendations from your physician or registered dietitian so you can start feeling like yourself again soon.&lt;br&gt;

But you don't have to feel this way, says registered dietitian and TODAY nutrition editor Natalie Rizzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most people are focused on getting enough protein before and after working out because they've likely heard it's crucial for muscle recovery, but it turns out that another macronutrient is just as vital, advises Rizzo, who specializes in sports nutrition. The macronutrient in question is carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But if you're thinking that her advice means you need to load up on bread, pasta or rice after every workout to get the muscle-boosting, think again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian tip of the day: Eat carbs and protein together to boost muscle recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These days it feels like the wellness world is all about protein, but carbs are just as important for staying energized and fit. That's why Rizzo recommends eating carbs and protein together after working out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Carbohydrates are the main energy source for exercise," Rizzo explains. "The body actually stores carbs in the muscles and liver to serve as the primary energy source for activity. This stored form of carbs is called glycogen, and replacing glycogen after a workout is a crucial part of recovery. If you don’t replace glycogen, you may feel fatigued later in the day and during you next workout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6019055/#sec12" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that activities like walking, jogging, swimming, bicycling or resistance training utilize glycogen and require carbohydrate replacement, either through post-exercise recovery meal or increasing carbs throughout the day,” Rizzo adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although carbohydrates have been demonized by wellness movements of the past, they have a lot of benefits,&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705" target="_blank"&gt; according to Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. They are a primary energy source for the body and often provide fiber, important for gut health and preventing chronic disease.

But you don't have to feel this way, says registered dietitian and TODAY nutrition editor Natalie Rizzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most people are focused on getting enough protein before and after working out because they've likely heard it's crucial for muscle recovery, but it turns out that another macronutrient is just as vital, advises Rizzo, who specializes in sports nutrition. The macronutrient in question is carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But if you're thinking that her advice means you need to load up on bread, pasta or rice after every workout to get the muscle-boosting, think again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian tip of the day: Eat carbs and protein together to boost muscle recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These days it feels like the wellness world is all about protein, but carbs are just as important for staying energized and fit. That's why Rizzo recommends eating carbs and protein together after working out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Carbohydrates are the main energy source for exercise," Rizzo explains. "The body actually stores carbs in the muscles and liver to serve as the primary energy source for activity. This stored form of carbs is called glycogen, and replacing glycogen after a workout is a crucial part of recovery. If you don’t replace glycogen, you may feel fatigued later in the day and during you next workout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6019055/#sec12" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that activities like walking, jogging, swimming, bicycling or resistance training utilize glycogen and require carbohydrate replacement, either through post-exercise recovery meal or increasing carbs throughout the day,” Rizzo adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although carbohydrates have been demonized by wellness movements of the past, they have a lot of benefits,&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705" target="_blank"&gt; according to Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. They are a primary energy source for the body and often provide fiber, important for gut health and preventing chronic disease. And certain whole grains, fruits and veggies can reduce risk of weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Without carbs, your muscles may not recover adequately after working out, the risks of include injury and decreased performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Incorporating carbs after a workout doesn’t need to be complicated, Rizzo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Rather than having a protein shake after a workout, make a smoothie with a protein source, like yogurt or soy milk, and add a handful of fruit.

&lt;p&gt;Good morning! Today, we discuss how scientists are pushing back against NIH funding cuts, get to know Covid contrarian Tracy Beth Høeg, who is new at the FDA, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-need-to-know-this-morning"&gt;The need-to-know this morning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regeneron Pharma&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;a href="https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/regeneron-enters-asset-purchase-agreement-acquire-23andmer-256" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;23andMe&lt;/strong&gt;, the bankrupt genetic testing and database company, for $256 million. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-some-nih-grants-are-reinstated-as-researchers-fight-back"&gt;Some NIH grants are reinstated as researchers fight back&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After an alarming wave of NIH grant terminations citing vague “agency priorities” — often targeting diversity-related studies — some scientists are mounting successful campaigns to get their research dollars back. Neurologist Charles DeCarli had his $53 million Alzheimer’s study cut in March, only to see it restored a month later after rallying lawmakers, media, and advocacy groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others are turning to lawsuits, congressional allies, and professional societies to contest defunding decisions, STAT’s Elizabeth Cooney writes. A grassroots playbook seems to be emerging — with off-the-record webinars, political pressure, and litigation — as researchers scramble to preserve scientific integrity in an increasingly politicized funding landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re reinstated and everything’s back in order,” DeCarli, who works at University of California, Davis, told STAT. “Some of the smaller universities may not want to fight this and they may just want to roll over.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-covid-contrarian-nbsp-hoeg-joins-fda-leadership"&gt;Covid contrarian Høeg joins FDA leadership&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tracy Beth Høeg, once a sports medicine physician and now a prominent skeptic of Covid-19 policies, has quietly assumed influential roles at the FDA under Commissioner Marty Makary and CBER chief Vinay Prasad. As a political appointee advising on vaccines, she’s already participated in high-level decisions — including the delay in Novavax’s Covid shot approval — raising alarms among public health experts wary of political interference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though Høeg is not explicitly anti-vaccine, she has publicly questioned mandates, vaccine schedules, and the regulatory rigor of U.S. health agencies. Her ascent may be the latest sign of a more skeptical approach to vaccines from U.S. regulators, STAT’s Lizzy Lawrence writes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Americans (from the US) compared with Danes are to a much greater extent under the perception that health is something you get in a bottle, an injection, a pill, through a surgery or at the hospital,” Høeg wrote in a 2023 Substack post titled “FDA’s shortcomings: A list.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fda-green-lights-first-alzheimer-s-blood-test"&gt;FDA green lights first Alzheimer’s blood test&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FDA on Friday cleared the first blood test to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease by detecting amyloid plaques in the brain. Developed by Fujirebio Diagnostics, the test offers a faster, less invasive alternative to PET scans or spinal taps and could help catch cases earlier, potentially boosting access to next-gen drugs like Biogen and Eisai’s Leqembi and Eli Lilly’s Kisunla.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The test measures the proteins pTau217 and beta-amyloid 1-42, STAT’s Elaine Chen and Adam Feuerstein write. This approval marks a long-awaited milestone, but experts caution that the test’s ease of use might lead to overprescribing in primary care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The notion 10 years ago that there’d be a blood test that detects the pathologies of Alzheimer’s was a bit of a science fiction fantasy kind of story, and now here it is FDA-approved and ready for clinical practice,” University of Pennsylvania Alzheimer’s researcher Jason Karlawish told STAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-novavax-s-covid-19-vaccine-finally-cleared-by-fda"&gt;Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine finally cleared by FDA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From STAT’s Helen Branswell: &lt;/i&gt;Novavax has finally &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/17/fda-approves-novavax-covid-shot-with-conditions-after-delay/"&gt;received a full license&lt;/a&gt; for its Covid-19 vaccine, though the FDA put restrictions on its use that its competitors do not face. Where Moderna and Pfizer have licenses that allow use of their Covid vaccines in anyone 12 years of age and older, the FDA has limited use of the Novavax vaccine to people 65 and older, and to people aged 12 to 64 who have a medical condition that puts them at high risk of severe illness if they contract Covid. The agency did not indicate why it was applying a different criterion to the Novavax vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple signals have emerged suggesting that leadership at HHS and FDA envisage more restricted access to Covid vaccines going forward. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/15/covid-vaccine-recommendations-rfk-jr-reportedly-reversing-for-children-pregnant-women/"&gt;has reportedly told supporters&lt;/a&gt; he plans to drop recommendations for children, teens, and pregnant people to get the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other vaccine news, it emerged late last week that Kennedy has signed off on three vaccine recommendations passed last month by the CDC’s vaccines advisory panel relating to use of chikungunya vaccines. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/16/cdc-acip-advisory-panel-recommends-expanded-rsv-and-two-new-vaccines/"&gt;Three other recommendations&lt;/a&gt; passed by the ACIP in April appear to remain in limbo. They relate to use of a new meningococcal vaccine and lowering the age for who is recommended to get adult RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diverging-perspectives-on-animal-models-in-medical-research"&gt;Diverging perspectives on animal models in medical research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FDA last month announced it would phase out animal testing, replacing it with more “human-relevant” methods — including organoids and AI-based computational models. Opining for STAT are experts with opposing viewpoints:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Animal models are’t just helpful; they’re irreplaceable,” &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/19/animal-models-research-nih-biology-medical-breakthroughs-nobel-prize/" rel=""&gt;writes Carole LaBonne&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Society for Developmental Biology. “They remain central to understanding the complexities of biology and disease, paving the way for discoveries that continually improve — and save — human lives.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum are veterinarian Ellen P. Carlin, a vice president at Pathway Policy Group, and virologist Jason Paragas, who is CEO of DVLP Medicines. They assert that testing on in vivo models “was never based on a scientific rationale that animals would provide predictive models for drug interactions with human physiology.” In addition to being ethically complex, “the process has eliminated candidates that could have been game-changers for patients. The screening mechanism is faulty.”&lt;/p&gt;

Some people can do this very well, whereas others lack this capacity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg told Fox News Digital that his team's long-term goal is to "figure out what microbes are responsible for this metabolic activity so that we can create probiotics that people can consume that will afford them the capacity to generate urolithins in their gut."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reap the health benefits, Rosenberg suggested eating about five to 10 walnuts per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A person should eat five to 10 walnuts per day to reap the health benefits.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Feldman, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of nutrition at Long Island University in New York, was not affiliated with the study but told Fox News Digital that walnuts "are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These acids "are anti-inflammatory and, generally, Americans are not getting enough of them," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Lifestyle articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:foxnews.com/lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feldman also noted that walnuts are rich in fiber, which is "another nutrient Americans are lacking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adequate fiber intake is associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although walnuts are a healthy snack, Feldman said they are considered a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-calorie food;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-calorie food&lt;/a&gt; — so consumers should be mindful of portion sizes, "typically sticking to about a handful at a time throughout the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/simple-dietary-change-could-lower-your-risk-colon-cancer-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Simple dietary change could lower your risk of colon cancer, study says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Simple dietary change could lower your risk of colon cancer, study says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 13:47:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE8wc0FDREhfZ0UtVlNpejVud0JqeEozSEwzU082OHd4UkxtMkxoM2Y4Q0VJT3NKcEdLQWwyMDlRTmVVcTB5OFlYanhKSmRDRjRNci1qZkt0QnlranpBN2V3b1pMZGJLcUNNVy1paURyNHpOaU1DdkVv</guid></item><item><title>阅读小说增强同理心，消除孤独感-神经科学新闻 | Reading Fiction Boosts Empathy and Fights Loneliness - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5JODVDcVhuMEFHbXFXRzY1akxrMnlQYUxPNU9TMzFFZy1HM0Z0S0tXLVR5T25YanBmUEpEZjd5eXFOUmIwSl9zOUp5RUY2UmFmSW9sUWNxSmVHUUZvMTZQM0FiVUh0V3hMb3J2ckYwSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;While AI companions are marketed as a fix for loneliness, research shows that reading offers far more meaningful benefits. Reading fiction can foster social connection, reduce stress, enhance empathy, and even reshape brain activity linked to social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared reading and book clubs have been shown to reduce loneliness and improve mental health, especially among young adults and older populations. Unlike digital interactions, reading activates brain regions involved in understanding others, offering a powerful, low-tech solution to modern social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Brain Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Reading fiction activates brain areas tied to empathy and connection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Aid:&lt;/strong&gt; Readers report less loneliness, better sleep, and lower stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Frequent reading is linked to a lower risk of dementia and cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loneliness has become such a widespread problem that Silicon Valley billionaires are now highlighting it to market AI companions, with Mark Zuckerberg recently stating, “the average American has fewer than three friends”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This actually echoes what the World Health Organization has called a crisis of social isolation and loneliness. They report that around 25% of older adults are socially isolated and 5%-15% of adolescents are lonely. But a variety of research – including our own – suggests reading may be a much better solution than chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110118"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a person reading and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reading-loneliness-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A number of studies have similarly shown that engaging in cognitively stimulating activities, such as reading, can slow cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human interaction is no doubt hugely important. In a study we published in 2023, we found that it only takes around five close friends &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;for children and adolescents to thrive&lt;/a&gt;, giving them better brain structure, cognition, academic performance and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having fewer than five close friends may not provide enough social contact. But larger numbers are less likely to be close friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dilemma of technology frequently means that despite some people having vast numbers of friends on social media, they are not close friends and so do not provide the social support needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, chatbots may not provide the type of face-to-face social interaction that people need to flourish. During the pandemic lockdowns, a study found that face-to-face communication was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10191089/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;far more beneficial&lt;/a&gt; for mental health than digital communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can reading help us to feel less lonely and have better wellbeing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent survey from The Queen’s Reading Room, the charity and book club of Queen Camilla, and other surveys, have found that reading fiction and other books significantly reduces feelings of loneliness and improves wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another charity, The Reader, conducted a survey of approximately 2,000 participants and found that this was especially true among young adults. Fifty-nine percent of those aged 18-34 said reading made them feel more connected to others and 56% felt less alone during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another survey, in conjunction with the University of Liverpool, of over 4,000 participants found that reading offers powerful benefits, serving as a top method for reducing stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, participants reported that reading encouraged personal growth, such as improving health, picking up hobbies and boosting empathy, with 64% of readers having a better understanding others’ feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reading and the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, scientific research looking at book clubs and shared reading back this up, finding &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38316632/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;notable emotional and social benefits&lt;/a&gt; of reading. For example, students reported greater connection (42.9%) to others, deeper understanding of others’ experiences and beliefs (61.2%) and reduced loneliness (14.3%) as a result of reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surveys above all rely on people reporting how they feel, rather than an objective measure. But there are also findings from objective measures of the brain, including neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of 11 intervention studies showed that shared reading among older adults &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/40/2/daaf036/8110077?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;improved wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; and helped alleviate loneliness and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way in which reading may help reduce loneliness is by enhancing our social cognition, which is the ability to understand and connect with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/2/215/2375122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neuroimaging study&lt;/a&gt; of young adults found that reading fiction, particularly passages with social content, activated areas of the brain involved in social behaviour and emotional understanding, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brain region was also linked to the stronger social cognition seen in frequent fiction readers, suggesting a neural pathway through which reading fosters greater social connectedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, reading may also reduce the risk of dementia. One study of 469 people aged 75 and over, with no dementia at baseline, were followed up for 5.1 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among leisure activities such as playing board games, playing musical instruments and dancing, reading was associated &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12815136/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with a 35% reduced risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of studies have similarly shown that engaging in cognitively stimulating activities, such as reading, &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/abs/10.1212/01.wnl.0000192165.99963.2a?casa_token=Ihv-keCL5qcAAAAA%3AuPNBvFyPFqvcxqrGrC3dwdbh-qZGPWIEGh6yxq9WVMekTDULJx-_N3u4WxYMOlvUCKT7VSwP5oFTndLL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;can slow cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11851541/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reduce the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our own research also showed the benefits of reading for pleasure early in life. In a large sample of over 10,000 children in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/earlyinitiated-childhood-reading-for-pleasure-associations-with-better-cognitive-performance-mental-wellbeing-and-brain-structure-in-young-adolescence/03FB342223A3896DB8C39F171659AE33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;we found that&lt;/a&gt; those children who read for pleasure early in life had better brain structure, cognition, academic achievement, longer sleep duration and better mental health – including lower symptoms of inattention, stress and depression – when adolescents.

However, little is mentioned about the kingdom &lt;em&gt;Fungi.&lt;/em&gt; Hundreds of thousands of species of fungi have been described, but that’s &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/67065410" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:likely only 10 percent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;likely only 10 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the total number of fungal species that exist on Earth. These species include everyone’s delicious favorites, but also some more dangerous species that can cause toxic infections in animals and agricultural crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, in a new study from the University of Manchester, scientists asked the question of what &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a22584056/rising-temperatures-could-lead-increased-suicide-rates/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rising global temperatures;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rising global temperatures&lt;/a&gt; could mean for the proliferation of some of these meaner mycelia.

The study showed that within 15 years, if the world still relies on mostly &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/green-tech/a32036783/gas-pump-warning/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fossil fuels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt; instead of clean energy, fungi like &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/em&gt;—a cause of agricultural rot that also produces mycotoxins that are harmful to mammals—will spread by 16 percent, which would put an additional 1 million people at risk of infection in Europe alone. This is largely because &lt;em&gt;A. flavus &lt;/em&gt;is more thermotolerant than other fungi, meaning that it can thrive in hot, humid climates where other fungi simply could not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, this proliferation is relatively tame compared to &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/em&gt;, which would increase its range by 77.5 percent and put an additional &lt;em&gt;nine million people&lt;/em&gt; in Europe at risk under this &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a248/1289281/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:worst-case scenario;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;worst-case scenario&lt;/a&gt;.

Some life-&lt;em&gt;sustaining&lt;/em&gt; fungi, responsible for breaking down plant and animal matter, may not be able to survive in some of the hottest parts of the world (especially on the African continent). It’s basically a one-two punch of bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, the study only examined the roughly 10 percent of the fungi we know about, so even more infections or health concerns could arise from surprising sources currently unknown to us.

He adds that your body’s hormonal processes can also cause hair loss. This is because it’s a process that happens in the scalp when the skin converts testosterone to active testosterone. Factors such as anabolic steroid use can raise testosterone levels and worsen this process. Other hormone imbalances, such as those caused by thyroid dysfunction or chronic stress, can contribute to different types of hair loss as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you’re worried about hair loss, there are blood tests you can take to see if it’s genetic or hormonal. “It could be due to a disease that can be managed. And, if not, it will help you gain an understanding of what you can expect over the next five, 10, 15 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Environmental factors can also speed up or slow down the process, says Sokratous. “Are you eating a diet rich in nutrients like zinc, vitamin D, iron and B vitamins? Is your body absorbing them properly? Adjusting your diet can slow things down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 13:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOVGEweUlwYmFrZFhOamk2VWFmN2JpLUpXVkcwX3I5MGxkVDNCQ19qeFpuSWZVME9MXzZIcUd2a19IZjRaYVpjRTk5eHdNazJfb0praGVlRXhTUWlvZTZYeEVLX3RXQjRPbzVXNlVQUkNYUzZuMUtFX0E2WUlQNmRhbTJRS21nV2s0VE1ESDB6Nl9XM0F5T0JTMjIySEdZTGxVX0lVdWNCNFkwdUp0eUgtSkZidVc4NV9PczJV</guid></item><item><title>尊敬的医生：德国麻疹与普通麻疹相同吗？ - OregonLive.com | Dear Doctor: Is German measles the same as regular measles? - OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JPB2L2NB6NFONF7OYJ5UBNQNGI"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I read a recent column of yours in which you said that everyone who is my age can assume we’ve had measles. I remember having measles when I was in the second grade but have a vague memory of my parents calling it German measles, which I believe is rubella. If a person has had either, do they have immunity to both types of measles? -- S.F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WRU27VH4DBCU7FBNVU64ZWRKZA"&gt;ANSWER: If you were born before 1957, you are likely (but not 100% sure) to be immune to measles (sometimes called red measles) and mumps. However, rubella (German measles) is a different disease, and immunity to one does not ensure immunity to the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K3IXO2LDD5HVFMVZHSAXWOYQAY"&gt;The biggest health concern with rubella is when a woman of childbearing age contracts it as the potential damage to her developing fetus can be severe. So, every woman who could get pregnant is tested for immunity at the earliest opportunity.

This can be done by checking blood antibody levels or giving an extra dose to those who have already been immunized (or two doses to those who have never been immunized). At the time that I write this, there is no rubella outbreak in the U.S., but if there is, the advice will be similar to demonstrate immunity to rubella as it is for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: Would you say a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in my water every morning would give me a more alkaline system? -- L.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DDXUQ6EMKRG5LDTZ3ZB2PMQGV4"&gt;ANSWER: Baking soda is basic or alkali on the pH scale. If you put a 1/2 teaspoon in a large glass of water, the pH of the resulting solution will be around 8.3 or so. However, as soon as you drink it, the acid in your stomach will overwhelm the baking soda since stomach acid is a lot stronger an acid than baking soda is a base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XMEKBDEB4BHNHLQQLVXU44FZTI"&gt;Furthermore, your body has robust systems to keep your body’s pH regulated at just around 7.4. Your kidneys and lungs will quickly act to maintain your body’s pH, whether you take in a lot of alkaline like baking soda or a whole lot of acid like lemon juice or lemonade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="22H45Q6XTNA6XHYZCWI4VEXTT4"&gt;These pH regulatory systems have evolved to keep the blood pH at a slightly alkaline level, and even small changes from this level usually represent serious illness.

A new review reveals that psychological treatments—particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)—can reduce pain through measurable changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review of multiple studies found that therapy shifts brain network activity, helping people loosen harmful thought patterns and reduce emotional stress linked to pain. These brain-based changes are associated with less pain and improved quality of life, offering new hope for accessible, non-drug treatments like CBT or even apps based on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Psychological therapy alters brain networks tied to pain and emotion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBT Works:&lt;/strong&gt; Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most supported and effective method.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Apps may offer scalable access to therapy-based pain relief.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Aarhus University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back pain, migraines, arthritis, long-term concussion symptoms, complications following cancer treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the conditions linked to chronic pain, which affects one in five adults—and for which medication is not always the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110114"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pain-therapy-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When we are in this state, a specific network in the brain known as the default mode network is active. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new review study offers insight into how specific types of psychological treatment can help relieve this pain— through physical changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research article was published today in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, one of the world’s leading medical journals. The study is led by Professor Lene Vase from the Department of Psychology at Aarhus BSS, Aarhus University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, people go to the doctor when they are in pain, and the doctor usually prescribes medication to ease the pain. But medication doesn’t always work well for chronic pain, and many doctors are looking for other treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psychological treatment is one alternative, and we are now one step closer to understanding exactly how it works,” says Lene Vase, who in addition to being a professor of psychology also holds a doctorate in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific explanation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not new that psychological treatment can relieve pain. What is new is the detailed scientific explanation behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies have shown that patients experience less pain after psychological treatment. But is this just a feeling? Does the mental processing simply distract us and help us cope with the pain? Or do physical changes in the body actually occur?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the article published today, Lene Vase and her colleagues review a number of previous studies. Each study on its own is too small and inconclusive to draw firm conclusions about physical changes in patients. However, when the researchers analyse them together, a clear pattern emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need more studies before we can pinpoint with scientific certainty exactly which elements of psychological therapy affect the brain, and how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, the analysis we’re publishing today provides clear indications of which specific elements of psychological treatment are most important, and how they are associated with changes in the way the brain and spinal cord process pain,” says Lene Vase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the brain is on autopilot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Vase highlights cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as a method that shows clear effects. This type of therapy focuses, among other things, on changing automatic thought patterns—the thoughts and feelings that occur when we are not actively thinking, and the brain is on autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we are in this state, a specific network in the brain known as the default mode network is active. This network interacts with other brain networks which are directly linked to pain and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, researchers can see—put simply—that activity in these networks changes when people shift their thought patterns and emotions through therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re in pain, it can easily take over your life. You might worry about how it will affect your job or your family, and you might avoid doing things you used to enjoy. If you are able to loosen these thoughts and emotions and return to living life as normally as possible, we can see that this is linked to visible changes in the brain, less pain and improved quality of life,” says Lene Vase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try an app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The professor believes this new knowledge can be used actively by psychologists, doctors and patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So far, what we know most about is the effect of sitting face to face with a psychologist, but unfortunately, there aren’t enough psychologists to treat everyone who suffers from pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fortunately, it seems that doctors, physiotherapists and nurses can also help guide patients towards pain-relieving ways of thinking. And some people may even be able to help themselves—perhaps by using an app,” says Lene Vase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are already more than 500 apps for psychological pain relief, the researchers write in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;. But their effectiveness hasn’t yet been fully documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we wait for solid scientific evidence, I would personally choose an app based on cognitive behavioural therapy,” says Professor Lene Vase from the Department of Psychology at Aarhus BSS, Aarhus University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent Research Fund Denmark, Lundbeck Foundation, Aarhus University Research Foundation, National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health (USA), Medical Research Council (UK), National Institute for Health and Care Research (UK), The MayDay Foundation, Versus Arthritis, Arthritis Research and Southwood Family Donation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict of interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lene Vase has received fees for courses on pain and placebo and has served on the scientific programme committee for the World Congress of Pain.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique uses tiny, gas-filled “microbubbles” propelled by focused sound waves to open the brain’s protective barrier and stunt the growth of the malformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a clear example of serendipity in science. We were looking for something else – performing long-term safety studies of focused ultrasound as a tool for drug and gene delivery to CCMs – when we noticed that CCMs exposed to just focused ultrasound with microbubbles were being stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the initial observations, we spent years doing experiments to confirm the effect was real and reproducible,” said researcher Richard J. Price, PhD, co-director of UVA Health’s Focused Ultrasound Cancer Immunotherapy Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because the focused ultrasound treatment is relatively simple and non-invasive and the necessary clinical devices are becoming more common, if proven safe in clinical trials, I am hopeful it could eventually become a real treatment option.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Cavernomas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavernomas are clusters of overgrown blood vessels that can sprout like weeds in the brain, spinal cord or other parts of the body. Most cases cause no symptoms, but they can, in some instances, cause headaches, seizures, muscle weakness and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment options for patients include brain surgery, often used when the CCM is at risk of causing a dangerous brain bleed, or stereotactic radiosurgery, which uses radiation to destroy CCMs that are difficult or impossible for a surgeon to reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UVA’s new approach could offer an alternative that avoids unwanted side effects associated with brain surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery, Price says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, traditional brain surgery comes with the risks of the surgery itself and also the possibility that the removed cavernomas could regrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price and his collaborators were shocked at how well their microbubble treatment performed in lab tests. One month after treatment, the approach had halted the growth of 94% of CCMs in lab mice. During this same time, untreated CCMs grew seven-fold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing that really stands out is the magnitude of the effect. The mouse models of CCM are much more severe than human CCMs. Mouse CCMs grow exponentially. Yet despite their aggressive nature, CCMs in mice still respond completely to treatment,” said Price, of UVA’s Department of Biomedical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some studies, we even saw that brain tissue exposed to focused ultrasound with microbubbles was less inclined to harbor new CCMs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If translated to humans, this prophylactic effect could open the door to treatments for so-called ‘familial’ patients who are genetically predisposed to acquiring multiple new CCMs throughout their lifespan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, simulated treatment plans for patients with CCMs (patients who have received stereotactic radiosurgery) revealed that the approach is already viable with existing technology, though clinical trials will be needed before the federal Food and Drug Administration would consider making it available for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One notable aspect of the approach is that it doesn’t involve the use of any drugs. Scientists at UVA and elsewhere have been exploring the potential of focused ultrasound to briefly breach the blood-brain barrier – the brain’s natural defenses – to allow the targeted delivery of medications for Alzheimer’s and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in both Alzheimer’s and now cavernomas, the use of the sound-propelled microbubbles appears to have dramatic benefits even without drugs – benefits scientists can’t fully explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promising Alzheimer’s results have already led to the launch of several clinical trials testing the approach in patients. Price hopes UVA’s pioneering research will prompt the launch of similar trials soon for CCMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are very interested in understanding what is in the ‘black box’ that somehow connects focused ultrasound to the cessation of mutant cell expansion in the CCMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are also returning to our original ideas about drug and gene delivery to CCMs. Since the baseline effect stabilizes the lesions, perhaps we can now think of eradicating them entirely with additional therapies,” Price said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This type of discovery is largely an outcome of the investments UVA has made in focused ultrasound technology over the years. There are few other institutions in the world with the critical mass of expertise and infrastructure to allow new discoveries like this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Price and his collaborator Petr Tvrdik, PhD, recently received more than $3 million from the National Institutes of Health’s National Cancer Institute to support their ongoing CCM research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings Published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price and his collaborators have described their CCM results in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team consisted of Delaney G.

&lt;p&gt;Australia is drifting northward at a rate of about &lt;strong&gt;7 centimeters (just under 3 inches)&lt;/strong&gt; per year, making it the fastest-moving &lt;strong&gt;continent&lt;/strong&gt; on the planet. This movement is caused by the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indo-Australian tectonic plate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which carries not only &lt;strong&gt;mainland Australia&lt;/strong&gt; but also&lt;strong&gt; Tasmania&lt;/strong&gt;, parts of &lt;strong&gt;New Guinea&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;New Zealand&lt;/strong&gt;, and regions of the Indian Ocean basin. By comparison, most continents move at an average rate of about 1.5 centimeters (0.6 inches) per year. This speed means Australia shifts as quickly as human hair and fingernails grow, highlighting how dynamic the &lt;strong&gt;Earth’s surface&lt;/strong&gt; truly is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Science Behind Tectonic Shifts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tectonic shift refers to the movement of the &lt;strong&gt;plates&lt;/strong&gt; that make up Earth’s crust. The planet’s surface is divided into roughly a dozen major and several minor plates, which fit together like pieces of a cracked shell. These plates rest on the hot, molten &lt;strong&gt;mantle&lt;/strong&gt; beneath, and their movement is driven by heat generated from radioactive processes deep inside the Earth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This movement causes plates to collide, pull apart, or slide past each other, reshaping the planet’s surface over millions of years. According to the&lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/tectonics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (&lt;strong&gt;NOAA&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the average movement of continents is about &lt;strong&gt;1.5 centimeters per year&lt;/strong&gt;, but certain areas like coastal California experience faster motion, explaining their frequent &lt;strong&gt;earthquakes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Australia’s Movement Affects Mapping and Technology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Australia’s steady movement has practical implications for mapping and &lt;strong&gt;location-based technology&lt;/strong&gt;. The country used coordinates based on the Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994 (&lt;strong&gt;GDA94&lt;/strong&gt;), but by 2017, this system had become out of alignment with the continent’s actual position by approximately 1.6 meters (5.2 feet). To address this, the Australian government introduced the Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 (&lt;strong&gt;GDA2020&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Minister for Resources and Northern Australia Matt Canavan announced that “Australia’s coordinates have officially moved 1.8 metres northeast,” emphasizing the importance of updating the reference frame. This change enhances the accuracy of location data used in industries such as surveying, mobile location services, and emerging intelligent transport systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Geoscience Australia’s Role in Updating the Geodetic Framework&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geoscience Australia has played a leading role in implementing the &lt;strong&gt;GDA2020&lt;/strong&gt; update. Nick Brown, the project leader for GDA2020 at&lt;a href="https://www.ga.gov.au/news/news-archive/australia-officially-moves-1.8-metres-northeast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; Geoscience Australia&lt;/a&gt;, explained that the updated coordinates reflect the projected position of the Australian continent as of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To support this transition, Geoscience Australia and the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping (&lt;strong&gt;ICSM&lt;/strong&gt;) have developed technical manuals, online software tools like AUSPOS and AUSGeoid2020, and a web service to convert spatial data from the old GDA94 system to the new GDA2020 standard. These resources aim to help government agencies and spatial organizations update their data and maintain accurate mapping and positioning services across the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Australia’s continuous northward drift serves as a clear example of how Earth’s surface is in constant motion, requiring ongoing adjustments in scientific measurement and &lt;strong&gt;technology&lt;/strong&gt; to keep pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

But Mr Larrainzar's could hold 30, according to his medical team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Patient Oscar Larrainzar had a rare form of cancer and following treatment and had lost nearly all function of his bladder – describing himself as a 'ticking time bomb'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a procedure that took eight hours Mr Larrainzar had a kidney and bladder transplant &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The world first surgery was performed by Dr Nassiri (left) and a team of doctors at University College Los Angeles Medical Centre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient had also been dialysis-dependent for seven years after both of his kidneys were subsequently removed as part of his cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To address these deficits doctors performed a combined kidney and bladder transplant, allowing the patient to immediately stop dialysis and produce urine for the first time in seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First the kidney, then the bladder, were transplanted. The new kidney was then connected to the new bladder. The entire procedure took approximately eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The kidney immediately made a large volume of urine, and the patient's kidney function improved immediately,' Dr Nassiri, who was part of the team of surgeons who performed the procedure, added. 'There was no need for any dialysis after surgery, and the urine drained properly into the new bladder.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Despite the complexity of the case, everything went according to plan and the surgery was successful,' said Dr Gill, who is chairman of the urology department at University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The patient is doing well, and we are satisfied with his clinical progress to date.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Of course, this is very, very early.

The remaining states within the country made up 1.3% of positive cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Observing positive cases in states where the disease has not yet become endemic, Jane Sykes, lead author of the UC Davis study, told &lt;a href="https://goldrushcam.com/sierrasuntimes/index.php/news/local-news/66335-uc-davis-study-finds-dogs-could-help-predict-valley-fever-spread-in-humans" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sierra Sun Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Sierra Sun Times&lt;/a&gt;, "We should be closely watching those states because there could be under-recognition of the emerging fungal disease in humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Exposure to the disease and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/valley-fever/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_symptoms-symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:occurring symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;occurring symptoms&lt;/a&gt; may vary from person to person, which include fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, rashes, and muscle or joint pain, but severe cases may cause long-term lung problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Dogs are sentinels for human infections," Sykes said, per &lt;a href="https://goldrushcam.com/sierrasuntimes/index.php/news/local-news/66335-uc-davis-study-finds-dogs-could-help-predict-valley-fever-spread-in-humans" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sierra Sun Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Sierra Sun Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Valley fever may be exacerbated by drought conditions, which can lead to dry soil that can be picked up and dispersed across the land by strong winds, as a study in the journal Environmental International, shared by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412024006524#:~:text=Wind%20serves%20as%20a%20dispersing,et%20al.%2C%202017)." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science Direct;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Science Direct&lt;/a&gt;, explained. The fungal spore particles are then airborne, posing a health risk to humans and dogs who may accidentally inhale them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Intense heavy rainfall also creates the ideal conditions for the fungal spores to thrive, which tends to lead to bigger surges in positive cases when the rain returns, per &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/dangerous-airborne-fungus-boosted-by-california-droughts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UC San Diego;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;UC San Diego&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists have found that soil moisture across the globe has been depleting over decades.

Stock image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Professor Bethany Barone Gibbs, an expert in &lt;span&gt;epidemiology and biostatistics at the School of Public Health at West Virginia University, said the new study showed the importance of even small bursts of activity.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Replacing sedentary time with light intensity activities, like tidying up the house or strolling at a slow pace, was nearly as beneficial as moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activities, like biking or doing aerobics,' she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;These findings suggest sitting less and doing anything else—like taking a walk, cooking, playing with your dog or gardening—will help you stay healthier.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise physiologist and lead author of the study Keith Diaz, of the Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, added: 'Our study indicates that one doesn’t have to start running marathons after a cardiovascular event to see benefits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sitting less and moving or sleeping a little more can make a real difference.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise, of any kind, is known to help keep the heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The heart is a muscle and, just like those in your arms and legs, it gets stronger with exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs (pictured) are easy to spot — such as severe chest pain — others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A stronger heart can pump blood around the body more efficiently keeping cholesterol and blood pressure low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Diaz added the researchers had been particularly surprised that replacing sitting with sleeping would have such an impact on health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sleep is a restorative behaviour that helps the body and mind recover, which is especially important after a serious health event,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS advises that adults should get at least seven to nine hours of sleep per night for optimum health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.124.011644"&gt;Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, the team analysed data from 609 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All patients had attended Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City with symptoms of a heart attack, such as chest pain, between 2016 and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had an average of 62 and were split almost evenly in terms of sex.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Upon discharge, patients were given a watch which tracked their activity levels for the following 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists then followed up with the patients a year after they had first reported symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the conclusion of the study nearly one in 10 patients (50) had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors didn't detail exactly what condition the deceased patients had died from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the most active participants found they, on average, undertook 144-minutes of light physical activity, like walking, 25 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity, like jogging, had eight-and-half hours of sleep and spent nearly 12 hours sedentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, the least active patients spent nearly 16 hours sedentary, only spending 82 minutes doing light physical activity, less than three minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity and only slept about six-and-a-half hours on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study had several limitations which the authors acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Firstly, demographic data such as patients' wealth or where they lived was not collected— and this could have influenced their survival outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Secondly, the watches were only worn for about 30 days meaning that changes to physical activity levels among participants after this time would not have been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart disease is one of Britain's biggest killers, killing about 160,000 people a year, with the American death toll about five times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures estimate that around 1.4million people in the UK have previously had a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help protect themselves from health problems like heart attacks the NHS advises the public to aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moderate activity includes activities like a brisk walk or gardening whereas vigorous includes those like riding a bike or swimming.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 10:37:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

&lt;p class="block"&gt;Edward Fanelli, a former contractor from Freehold, New Jersey, said he was prescribed Ozempic to manage his diabetes, but within months, his vision went dark - forcing him to give up his career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"Not even six to eight months later, I, out of nowhere, I could not see out of my right eye," he says. "I couldn't take a chance do the contracting work, worried about cutting my fingers off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Fanelli says he was diagnosed with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a sudden on-set condition with no cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;He is the first patient in New Jersey to file a lawsuit in state court against the makers of Ozempic, claiming he was never warned the blockbuster drug could lead to irreversible vision loss.

	"If they would have told me a chance I could lose my vision, I would not have taken it. Don't care - weight loss would have done on my own," he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;He’s not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="block"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long Island-based attorney Jason Goldstein, of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourlawyer.com/"&gt;Parker Waichman LLP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, represents more than a dozen clients, including Fanelli, in lawsuits that center on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the active ingredient in Ozempic and similar drugs, which has now been linked in medical literature to NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Goldstein claims the drugmakers failed to warn patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"That's the crux of this case, people are not warned about this. What did the doctor know? What did the patient know? No one knew," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Goldstein says he will be pushing for updated warning labels and compensation so future patients don't find themselves negatively impacted by a drug they thought would help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A Novo Nordisk spokesperson released the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"NAION is a very rare eye disease, and it is not an adverse drug reaction for the marketed formulations of semaglutide (Ozempic®, Rybelsus® and Wegovy®) as per the approved labels. After a thorough evaluation of studies from the University of Southern Denmark and Novo Nordisk’s internal safety assessment, Novo Nordisk is of the opinion that the benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Novo Nordisk, on its part, has conducted an analysis across randomized controlled clinical trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including a blinded ophthalmologist evaluation to confirm NAION diagnoses. These data do not suggest a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA use and NAION events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously. This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes. Any decision to start treatment with prescription-only medicines should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional who should do a benefit-risk evaluation for the patient in question, weighing up the benefits of treatment with the potential risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 - New Jersey</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 10:20:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNYWpDX1RvMkZZRGhYTURROUVFVW91Vkh4WmVGRnNMamRuOUhsMWs2a0ZOV1dDUmlLNHo2UmxKUV85d3ZuUFpibDBCVlI2TUxYZnNCLV96bzMxSG9Cd3o0UUJyVHdqX29TM1ctYWJ2WEZheC1EOEpGbm9GLXFLc0xhanpFSUF4bkRyNXVDQTFfalBRSUJLMlVVbWdidWt2V1BiZmljbzRTUFNnSVNv</guid></item><item><title>越来越多的患者声称Ozempic可能导致不可逆转的视力丧失-新闻12 -布朗克斯区 | Growing number of patients claim Ozempic can come with irreversible vision loss - News 12 - The Bronx</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOeXBDSXUtQjFycjF6UHFjUmJUTDhrN1FZZWNNT2haeVZGSE5zdGNQQlNMeDVSV1ZyUmJkYkd2WWhrNXcyeGJMT2FZbEN4TTB4MXlrODRUUmQ0NV9QTG9iUW05TjRMSDMxclcxbGZvUUtJaUJvMFRXUjIyTnFUWWgwaVk5dGxESk5VaGZGOXd5MXpjUm5FYlNvTF9aeVRVZHdlM09QeXBBMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div alignitems="normal" justifycontent="normal" direction="column" gap="1rem,1.25rem" flexwrap="nowrap" class="sc-fsYfdN hQgjIe sc-e6358465-0 dxMubp"&gt;&lt;p class="block"&gt;Weight loss drugs like Ozempic are some of the most in-demand drugs on the market - prescribed for everything from diabetes to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that young people with this condition showed stronger connectivity within a specific brain network that helps detect unexpected events. This heightened connection appeared to fade in those who recovered from the disorder over time, suggesting a potential brain-based marker linked to anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder often begins during childhood or adolescence and is marked by persistent, uncontrollable worry across many areas of life. It can interfere with academic, social, and emotional development and is associated with a greater risk for other mental health challenges later on. Despite its early onset, little is known about how this condition may affect the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generalized anxiety disorder emerges in childhood or adolescence for some individuals, but lot of what we know about brain connectivity comes from adult studies,” said study authors Sam A. Sievertsen of the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University and Jennifer Forsyth of the University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study aimed to fill that gap by exploring how the brains of youth with generalized anxiety disorder differ in terms of functional connectivity. This refers to how brain regions communicate with each other while the person is at rest. Using brain imaging data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study—a large, ongoing project following nearly 12,000 youth across the United States—the researchers compared connectivity patterns in children with generalized anxiety disorder to those without any psychiatric diagnoses. They also looked at whether these patterns changed as the children’s symptoms changed over a two-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ABCD Study offered us a unique opportunity to look at thousands of youth and assess how large-scale brain networks differ in those who meet criteria for Generalized anxiety disorder at this earlier age from those who do not,” the researchers explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on six large-scale brain networks known to be involved in attention, emotion, and self-awareness, as well as six subcortical regions deep in the brain that play important roles in motivation, memory, and emotional processing. They analyzed resting-state brain scans from 164 youth who had been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and compared them to scans from over 3,000 youth without any diagnosed mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a statistical model to examine how strongly brain areas within each network were connected and how these networks communicated with the subcortical regions. They also tested whether these connectivity patterns were different in youth with other conditions that often co-occur with generalized anxiety, such as depression or other anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest findings was that youth with generalized anxiety disorder had slightly stronger connectivity within the brain’s ventral attention network. This network is involved in automatically redirecting attention to sudden or important changes in the environment. Stronger connectivity in this network may reflect a heightened sensitivity to potentially threatening or unexpected events—a feature often reported by individuals with anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were struck by the ventral attention network being the signal most specific to youth with generalized anxiety disorder in our study,” Sievertsen and Forsyth told PsyPost. “There were other subcortical region-cortical network connectivity differences in generalized anxiety disorder, but they were less pronounced and less unique to generalized anxiety disorder compared to other diagnoses like depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this connectivity difference appeared to change with the clinical course of the disorder. Among youth who no longer met the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder two years later, the heightened ventral attention network connectivity was reduced. In contrast, those who continued to meet criteria for the disorder showed no significant change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hyperconnectivity went away in youth when their anxiety remitted, implying this pattern shifts with generalized anxiety disorder symptoms,” the researchers said. “The effects we saw were modest and based on observational data, so we can’t say that this causes or is caused by generalized anxiety disorder – but it suggests that the strength of this network’s connectivity is associated with it and should be examined further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this core finding, the researchers also observed stronger connectivity between certain cortical networks and subcortical regions in youth with generalized anxiety disorder. These included the amygdala, which plays a key role in processing emotional stimuli; the caudate and putamen, which are involved in goal-directed behavior and reward processing; and parts of the brain associated with monitoring internal states and maintaining alertness. These connections were generally stronger in the anxiety group compared to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not all connectivity differences were specific to generalized anxiety disorder. In some cases, the same connectivity patterns were seen in youth with other conditions, such as depression or separation anxiety. For example, stronger connections between the brain’s control network and the caudate or amygdala were found in multiple groups. This suggests that while some brain changes may be linked to generalized anxiety disorder in particular, others may reflect broader alterations related to mood or anxiety symptoms more generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined whether these brain differences were associated with the severity of anxiety symptoms, based on parent and youth reports. They found no strong associations between connectivity measures and symptom severity scores. This may suggest that these brain differences are more closely tied to diagnostic status than to specific levels of worry or fear. Alternatively, it could reflect limitations in how symptom severity was measured or the complexity of linking brain patterns with fluctuating emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was not designed to test treatment effects directly, but most children with generalized anxiety disorder had received some form of mental health care by the two-year follow-up. The researchers did not find strong links between treatment history and brain connectivity changes, though they note that more detailed information about the type and duration of therapy or medication would be needed to better assess this question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work has some limitations to consider. “The effect sizes in our study were modest and the clinical groups were still relatively small, so these differences should not be considered diagnostic or biomarkers by any means,” Sievertsen and Forsyth explained. “We also relied on parent-reported diagnoses because they best match clinician interviews at this age, which was helpful, but future work would benefit from using multi-informant or clinician assessments and more than two time points of data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this study represents one of the largest efforts to map brain connectivity differences in children with generalized anxiety disorder. Its findings suggest that stronger connections in the ventral attention network may play a role in the condition’s symptoms and could be explored as a potential biomarker in future research. Long-term, the researchers hope to investigate whether this pattern can help predict who develops anxiety, who recovers, and who responds best to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A key area of study now is to investigate whether the stronger connectivity we observed really forecasts who is experiencing generalized anxiety disorder, who recovers, or who benefits most from therapy – questions that growing longitudinal datasets and other clinical cohorts are poised to help test,” Sievertsen and Forsyth told PsyPost. “Future studies could pair resting scans with tasks designed to provoke worry, use diagnoses confirmed by both youth and clinicians, track children across more developmental checkpoints, and hone in on finer brain regions and brain-age models to help test the signal we observed and what it someday may mean for the clinic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We really appreciate the families and youth who participated in this research. We also hope that others will build on these findings and help move us toward more precise mental-health care for youth with generalized anxiety disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.02.005" target="_blank"&gt;Resting State Cortical Network and Subcortical Hyperconnectivity in Youth With Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the ABCD Study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sam A.

Each bird follows simple rules of interaction with its closest neighbours, yet out of these local interactions emerges a complex, coordinated dance that can respond swiftly to predators and environmental changes. This same principle of emergence – where sophisticated behaviours arise not from central control but from the interactions themselves – appears across nature and human society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how market prices emerge from countless individual trading decisions, none of which alone contains the ‘right’ price. Each trader acts on partial information and personal strategies, yet their collective interaction produces a dynamic system that integrates information from across the globe. Human language evolves through a similar process of emergence. No individual or committee decides that ‘LOL’ should enter common usage or that the meaning of ‘cool’ should expand beyond temperature (even in French-speaking countries). Instead, these changes result from millions of daily linguistic interactions, with new patterns of speech bubbling up from the collective behaviour of speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples highlight a key characteristic of highly interconnected systems: the rich interplay of constituent parts generates properties that defy reductive analysis. This principle of emergence, evident across seemingly unrelated fields, provides a powerful lens for examining one of our era’s most elusive mysteries: how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea of emergence inspired me to develop the concept I call the &lt;em&gt;entangled brain&lt;/em&gt;: the need to understand the brain as an interactionally complex system where functions emerge from distributed, overlapping networks of regions rather than being localised to specific areas. Though the framework described here is still a minority view in neuroscience, we’re witnessing a gradual paradigm transition (rather than a revolution), with increasing numbers of researchers acknowledging the limitations of more traditional ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;omplexity science is an interdisciplinary field that studies systems composed of many interacting components whose collective behaviours give rise to collective properties – phenomena that cannot be fully explained by analysing individual parts in isolation. These systems, such as ecosystems, economies or – as we will see – the brain, are characterised by nonlinear dynamics, adaptability, self-organisation, and networked interactions that span multiple spatial and temporal scales. Before exploring the ideas leading to the entangled brain framework, let’s revisit some of the historical developments of the field of neuroscience to set the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1899, Cécile and Oskar Vogt, aged 24 and 29 respectively, arrived in Berlin to establish the Neurological Centre, initially a private institution for the anatomical study of the human brain that in 1902 was expanded to the Neurobiological Laboratory, and then the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in 1914. Cécile Vogt was one of only two women in the entire institute. (In Prussia, until 1908, women were not granted access to regular university education, let alone the possibility to have a scientific career.) She obtained her doctoral degree from the University of Paris in 1900, while her husband Oskar obtained a doctorate for his thesis on the &lt;em&gt;corpus callosum&lt;/em&gt; from the University of Jena &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;in 1894.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1901, Korbinian Brodmann, who had concluded his doctorate in Leipzig in 1898, joined the group headed by the Vogts and was encouraged by them to undertake a systematic study of the cells of the cerebral cortex using tissue sections stained with a new cell-marking method. (The cortex is the outer brain surface with grooves and bulges; the subcortex comprises other cell masses that sit underneath.) The Vogts, and Brodmann working separately, were part of a first wave of anatomists trying to establish a complete map of the cerebral cortex, with the ultimate goal of understanding how brain structure and function are related. In a nutshell, where does a mental function such as an emotion reside in the brain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons – a key cell type of the nervous system – are diverse, and several cell classes can be determined based on both their shape and size. Researchers used these properties, as well as spatial differences in distribution and density, to define the boundaries between potential sectors. In this manner, Brodmann subdivided the cortex into approximately 50 regions (also called areas) per hemisphere. The Vogts, in contrast, thought that there might be more than 200 of them, each with its own distinguishing cytoarchitectonic pattern (that is, cell-related organisation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;It is an idea that comes close to being an axiom in biology: function is tied to structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brodmann’s map is the one that caught on and stuck, likely because neuroanatomists opposed too vigorous a subdivision of the cortex, and today students and researchers alike still refer to cortical parts by invoking his map. Although relatively little was known about the functions of cortical regions at the time, Brodmann believed that his partition identified ‘organs of the mind’ – he was convinced that each cortical area subserved a particular function. Indeed, when he joined the Vogts’ laboratory, they had encouraged him to try to understand the organisation of the cortex in light of their main thesis that different cytoarchitectonically defined areas are responsible for specific physiological responses and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a deep logic that the Vogts and Brodmann were following. In fact, it is an idea that comes close to being an axiom in biology: function is tied to structure. In the case at hand, parts of the cortex that are structurally different (contain different cell types, cell arrangements, cell density, and so on) carry out different functions. In this manner, they believed they could understand how function is individuated from a detailed characterisation of the underlying microanatomy. They were in search of the &lt;em&gt;functional units &lt;/em&gt;of the cortex – where the function could be sensory, motor, cognitive and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;so on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other organs of the body that have more clear-cut boundaries, the cortex’s potential subdivisions are not readily apparent at a macroscopic level. One of the central goals of many neuroanatomists in the first half of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20th century&lt;/span&gt; was to investigate such ‘organs of the mind’ (an objective that persists to this day). A corollary of this research programme was that individual brain regions – say, Brodmann’s &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;area 17&lt;/span&gt; in the back of the brain – implemented specialised mechanisms, in this case related to processing visual sensory stimuli. Therefore, it was vital to understand the operation of individual parts since the area/region was the rightful mechanistic &lt;em&gt;unit &lt;/em&gt;to understand how the nervous system works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists’ interest in brain regions was motivated by the notion that each region executes a particular function. For example, we could say that the function of the primary visual cortex is visual perception, or perhaps a more basic visual mechanism, such as detecting ‘edges’ (sharp light-to-dark transitions) in images. The same type of description can be applied to other sensory and motor areas of the brain. This exercise becomes considerably less straightforward for brain areas that are much less sensory or motor, as their workings become exceedingly difficult to determine and describe. Nevertheless, in theory, we can imagine extending the idea to all parts of the brain. The result of this endeavour would be a list of area-function pairs: &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;L &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;= {(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;), (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;), … , (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;)},&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;areas &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;implement &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;functions &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a serious problem with this endeavour. To date, no such list has been systematically generated. Indeed, current knowledge strongly suggests that this strategy will &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;yield a simple area-function list. What may start as a simple &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; pair, is gradually revised as research progresses, and eventually grows to include a &lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt; of functions, such that area &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; participates in a series of functions &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, … , &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; From a basic one-to-one &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt; → &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mapping, the picture evolves to a one-to-&lt;em&gt;many &lt;/em&gt;mapping: &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt; → {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;… , F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the mapping between structure and function is not one-to-one, then what kind of system is the brain? This is the question the entangled brain concept sets out to tackle. It’s useful to consider two types of information: anatomical and functional. Let’s start with the brain’s massive combinatorial anatomical connectivity. Neurons are constantly exchanging electrochemical signals with one another. Signalling between them is aided by physical cell extensions, called axons, that protrude beyond the cell body for distances from less than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;1 mm&lt;/span&gt; to around &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;15 mm&lt;/span&gt; in the central nervous system. Axons travelling longer distances typically bundle together along what are called white-matter tracts to distinguish them from tissue composed of neuronal cell bodies, which is called grey matter. Anatomical connectivity, then, can be viewed as a system of roads and highways that supports cell signalling in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hile most connections are local, the brain also maintains an impressive network of medium- and long-distance pathways. To give a rough sense of the dimensions involved, axonal lengths within local brain circuits (such as those within a single Brodmann area) have lengths from less than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;1 mm&lt;/span&gt; to just under &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;1 cm.&lt;/span&gt; Connections between adjacent and nearby regions can extend between 0.5 to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;4 cm,&lt;/span&gt; and connections between areas in different lobes, such as between the frontal and the occipital lobes, can reach &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;15 cm&lt;/span&gt; or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although details vary across mammalian species, there’s evidence that the brains of macaque monkeys (a species that has a brain organisation resembling that of humans) are densely interconnected. For example, when scientists looked at any two regions in the cortex, they found that about &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;60 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of the time there’s a direct connection between them (although the strength of the pathway decreases between regions that are farther apart). Notably, the cortex organises medium- and long-distance communication through special regions that act like major transportation hubs, routing and coordinating signals across the entire cortex, much like how major airports serve as central connection points in the global air transportation network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s just part of the story. Beyond the extensive interconnections found in the cortex, there are multiple ‘connectional systems’ that weave together regions even further. The entire cortex connects to deeper brain structures. We can think of the brain as having distinct sectors. Simplifying somewhat, these are the cortex, the subcortical parts that are physically beneath the cortex in humans, and the brainstem. In the 1980s, it became clear that the cortex and subcortex are part of extensive connectional loops – from cortex to subcortex back to cortex. We now know that the multiple sectors are amply interlinked. What is more, a subcortical structure such as the thalamus, viewed in the past as a relatively passive steppingstone conveying signals to the cortex, is so sweepingly interconnected with the entire cortex that it is perhaps better to think in terms of a cortical-thalamic system. Even subcortical areas believed to mainly control basic functions, like the hypothalamus, which regulates hunger and body temperature among others, have widespread connections throughout the brain. This creates an incredibly intricate connectional web where signals can travel between disparate parts through multiple routes, hence the idea of ‘combinatorial’ connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the implications of the connectional organisation of the brain? The dense nexus of pathways allows for remarkable flexibility in how the brain processes information and controls behaviour. Signals of all types can be exchanged and integrated in multiple ways. All this potential mixing strongly challenges how we traditionally think of the mind and brain in terms of simplistic labels such as ‘perception’, ‘cognition’, ‘emotion’ and ‘action’. I will return to this point later, but the standard view is further challenged by a second principle of brain organisation: highly distributed functional coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Groups of neurons that fire in a coherent fashion indicate that they are functionally interrelated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roman Empire’s roads, critical to its success, were extensive enough to circle the globe about twice over. In addition to obvious military applications, the road network supported trade, as well as cultural and administrative integration. These economic and cultural relationships and coordination between disparate parts of the empire were sustained by the incredible physical infrastructure known as the &lt;em&gt;cursus publicus&lt;/em&gt;. Likewise, in the brain we need to move beyond the anatomical domain (the roads) to functional properties (such as economic and cultural relationships between different parts of the Roman Empire), all the more because neuroscientists themselves often focus too much on anatomical features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brain, functional relationships between neuronal signals are detected across multiple spatial scales – from the local scale of neurons within a brain area to larger scales involving signals originating from the grey matter of different lobes (such as the frontal and parietal lobes, many centimetres apart). By signals, we mean the electrical activity of neurons that is directly recorded via microelectrodes inserted into grey matter (ie, neuronal tissue), measured indirectly when using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans, or possibly via other measurement techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kinds of functional relationships are detected? An important one is that signals from different sites exhibit synchronised neuronal activity. This is notable because groups of neurons that fire in a coherent fashion indicate that they are functionally interrelated, and potentially part of a common process. Different types of signal coordination are believed to reflect processes such as attention and memory, among others. Additional types of relationships are detected mathematically, too, such as whether the strength of the response in one brain area is related to the temporal evolution of signals in a disparate location. In the brain, we identify signal relationships that are indicators of joint functions between regions, much like detecting cultural exchanges between separate parts of the Roman Empire via evidence of shared artefacts or language patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When signals are measured from two sites within a local patch (say, a few millimetres across), it is not too surprising to find notable functional relationships between them (eg, their neuronal activity is correlated), as neurons likely receive similar inputs and are locally connected. Yet, we also observe functional relationships between neuronal signals from locations that are situated much farther apart and, critically, between brain parts that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; directly anatomically connected – there is no direct axonal connection between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this happen? There is evidence that signal coordination between regions depends more on the total number of possible communication routes between them than on the existence of direct connections between points A and B. For example, although regions A and B are not anatomically connected, they both connect to region C, which thus serves as a bridge between them. Even more circuitous paths can unite A and B, much like flying between two cities that have no direct flights and require multiple layovers. In such a manner, the brain creates functional partnerships that take advantage of all possible ways through its intricate pathways. This helps explain how the brain can be so remarkably flexible, sustaining different partnerships between regions depending on what we’re doing, thinking or feeling at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hen we consider the highways traversing the brain and how signals establish behaviourally relevant relationships across the central nervous system, we come to an important insight. In a highly interconnected system, to understand function, we need to shift away from thinking in terms of individual brain regions. The functional unit is not to be found at the level of the brain area, as commonly proposed. Instead, we need to consider neuronal ensembles distributed across multiple brain regions, much like the murmuration of starlings forms a single pattern from the collective behaviour of individual birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many instances of distributed neuronal ensembles. Groups of neurons extending over cortical (say, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) and subcortical (say, amygdala) regions form circuits that are important for learning what is threatening and what is safe. Such multiregion circuits are ubiquitous; fMRI studies in humans have shown that the brain is organised in terms of large-scale networks that stretch across the cortex as well as subcortical territories. For example, the so-called ‘salience network’ (suggested to be engaged when significant events are encountered) spans brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobes, among others, and can also be viewed as a neuronal ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we consider ensembles in the case of brain circuits or large-scale networks, the associated neuronal groupings should be viewed as strongly context dependent and dynamic. That is to say, they are not fixed entities but instead form dynamically to meet current situational requirements. Accordingly, they will dynamically assemble and disassemble as per behavioural needs. The implication of this view is that whereas brain regions A, B and C might generally be active together in dealing with a specific type of behaviour, in some contexts, we will also observe an ensemble that encompasses &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;region D,&lt;/span&gt; or instead the ensemble &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;{A, C, D}&lt;/span&gt; that meets slightly different requirements. In all, neuronal ensembles constitute an extremely malleable functional unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of how an orchestra works during a complex piece of music. The string section might split into different groups, with some violins joining the woodwinds for one musical phrase while others harmonise with the cellos. Later, these groupings shift completely for a different passage. The brain works in a related way: rather than recruiting fixed regions, it forms flexible aggregations that assemble and disassemble based on what we’re doing, thinking or feeling. This builds on what we learned about the brain’s extensive physical connections and the coordinated activity across regions. These features make the formation of ensembles possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Brain regions can participate in multiple networks simultaneously and shift their roles as needed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is common in science, these ideas have a long genealogy. In 1949, the Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb proposed that the brain’s ability to generate coherent thoughts derives from the spatiotemporal orchestration of neuronal activity. He hypothesised that a discrete, strongly interconnected group of active neurons called the &lt;em&gt;cell assembly&lt;/em&gt; represents a distinct mental entity, such as a thought or an emotion. Yet, these ideas have taken a long time to mature, not least due to technical limitations in measuring signals simultaneously across the brain, and the relative insularity of experimental neuroscience from other disciplines, such as computer science, mathematics and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a symphony emerges from both the individual instruments and how they play together, brain function emerges from both the regions themselves and their dynamic interactions. Scientists are finding that we can’t understand complex mental processes by studying individual brain regions in isolation, any more than we could understand a symphony by listening to each instrument separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s particularly fascinating is that these brain assemblages overlap and change over time. Just as a violin might be part of the string section in one moment and join a smaller ensemble in the next, brain regions can participate in multiple networks simultaneously and shift their roles as needed. But note that, in this view, even brain networks aren’t seen as constituted of fixed sets of regions; instead, they are dynamic coalitions that form and dissolve based on the brain’s changing needs. This flexibility helps explain how the brain can support such a wide range of complex behaviours using a limited number of regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categories such as perception, cognition, action, emotion and motivation are not only the titles of introductory textbooks, but reflect how psychologists and neuroscientists conceptualise the organisation of the mind and brain. They seek to subdivide the brain into territories that have preferences for processes that support a specific type of mental activity. Some parts handle perception, such as the back of the head and its involvement in vision, or the front of the brain and its role in cognition. And so on. The decomposition of the mind-brain adopted by many neuroscientists follows an organisation that is called modular. Modularity here refers to the idea that the brain consists of specialised, relatively independent components or modules that each handle specific mental functions, much like distinct parts in a machine that work together but perform separate operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, a modular organisation, popular as it is among neuroscientists, is inconsistent with the principles of the anatomical and functional neuroarchitecture discussed here. The brain’s massive combinatorial connectivity and highly distributed functional coordination defy clean compartmentalisation. The extensive bidirectional pathways spanning the entire brain create crisscrossing connectional systems that dissolve potential boundaries between traditional mental domains (cognition, &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;emotion, etc).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Anxiety, PTSD, depression and so on should be viewed as system-level entities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain regions dynamically affiliate with multiple networks in a context-dependent manner, forming coalitions that assemble and disassemble based on current demands. This interactional complexity means that functions aren’t localised to discrete modules but emerge from decentralised coordination across multiregion assemblies. The properties that emerge from these interactions cannot be reduced to individual components, making a strict modular framework inadequate for capturing the brain’s entangled nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the brain so entangled, and thus so unlike human-engineered systems? Brains have evolved to provide adaptive responses to challenges faced by living beings, promoting survival and reproduction – not to solve isolated cognitive or emotional problems. In this context, even the mental vocabulary of neuroscience and psychology (attention, cognitive control, fear, etc), with origins disconnected from the study of animal behaviour, provides problematic theoretical pillars. Instead, approaches inspired by evolutionary considerations provide better scaffolds to sort out the relationships between brain structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of the entangled brain are substantial for the understanding of healthy and unhealthy brain processes. It is common for scientists to seek a single, unique source of psychological distress. For example, anxiety or PTSD is the result of an overactive amygdala; depression is caused by deficient serotonin provision; drug addiction is produced by dopamine oversupply. But, according to the ideas described here, we should not expect unique determinants for psychological states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety, PTSD, depression and so on should be viewed as system-level entities. Alterations across several brain circuits, spanning multiple brain regions, are almost certainly involved. As a direct consequence, healthy or unhealthy states should not be viewed as emotional, motivational or cognitive. Such classification is superficial and neglects the intermingling that results from anatomical and functional brain organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should also not expect to find a single culprit, not even at the level of distributed neuronal ensembles. The conditions in question are too heterogeneous and varied across individuals; they won’t map to a single alteration, including at the distributed level. In fact, we should not expect a temporally constant type of disturbance, as brain processes are highly context-dependent and dynamic. Variability in the very dynamics will contribute to how mental health experiences are manifested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we need to stop seeking simple explanations for complex mind-brain processes, whether they are viewed as healthy or unhealthy. That’s perhaps the most general implication of the entangled brain view: that the functions of the brain, like the murmurations of starlings, are more complicated and more mysterious than its component parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 10:04:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPbDJobXBaTzlmT21lZ2tPLWJ3dDlVU182T3dQS29wYVZBUFJCMVgzT21fU05CTlYtcVdjVlBvdVl2eTk5dHZYSi1PV1Nxb1BKVTgtSEhSYVo3WHgybjFvUmFaQ3had3BlaHM0WDRMbUF5RnpQWEJDQ3U0TzJqWUtjbnNwWQ</guid></item><item><title>每天只需5分钟这些练习就可以随着年龄的增长磨练你的大脑-洛杉矶时报 | Just 5 minutes a day of these exercises can sharpen your brain as you age - Los Angeles Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQWmlvcmk2UFk2Z0M4T1ptVUljemE0NXI2ekFsR1RJckhLRE1fbnRFM3F3V2xQX2huTGhsUTY5YmZDX1ZPb1B6eU80REtPRzZvR0g3ZUVwbnZCUTh4S2F4bTdXN0wzOGExT3pPNks1bldCdXhfdVdHSGFiWDV0X0lnMHZad2ZGbHVoSlhfQjFaNE9pRE5xaDBzX3RfQmZJbmppNjFLcWMyOHNEeG5zUHllLVBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cmsFontBrandText font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix max-w-170 mt-7.5 mb-10 mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exercise has long been linked with stronger brains and reduced risk of dementia and other cognitive diseases. But new research suggests that older adults can significantly improve brain health with only a few minutes of daily movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the U.S.-based &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.adventhealth.com/institute/adventhealth-research-institute" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AdventHealth Research Institute&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that as few as five minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise a day correlated to significantly better cognitive performance. The study, &lt;a class="link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/4/afaf072/8106300?#511478665" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;published&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the British journal &lt;a class="link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Age &amp;amp; Ageing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in early April, examined data from hundreds of people 65 to 80 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that “huff-and-puff” movements, like running or lap swimming, were associated with better brain functions including information processing, focusing and multitasking and short-term memory. They also found that even a few minutes of moderate exercise like walking improves brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our key finding was that moving from doing zero minutes or very little moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to doing just five minutes a day — that’s where the biggest gain in cognitive function was seen,” said the study’s lead author, Maddison Mellow, a research associate at the University of South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers distinguished between moderate and vigorous exercise by applying a simple test: whether subjects could still manage to speak full sentences after moving around. Vigorous exercise makes that impossible, said Audrey Collins, a postdoctoral research scientist at AdventHealth Research Institute and the paper’s co-lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study observed 585 people, all in good health. Their physical activity was measured using accelerometers they wore on their wrists; the researchers tested cognitive functions using online and paper-based tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worth noting: This study also found a “strong relationship” between spending little to no time doing moderate to vigorous activity and poorer cognitive performance, Mellow said. One slightly surprising finding, she added, was that the cognitive performance gains from exercise don’t extend to longer-term memory and visual-spatial functions like judging distances or sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was novel in that it categorized how people divided their days into three behaviors: sleep, sedentary and active. And though &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041610225002704" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;getting enough quality sleep is important to brain health in midlife&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, the researchers said that when forced to choose between minutes spent sleeping and minutes spent exercising, reducing sleep time to spend more time moving resulted in better brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It didn’t really matter, in this sample, where time was coming from, whether from sleep, sedentary behavior or light intensity physical activity,” Mellow said. “So long as time was being increased in moderate vigorous activity, that’s where the benefits were being shown for cognitive outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, what are some moderate or vigorous bursts of exercise for older adults to do every day? We consulted experts to give you five accessible options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="1-walking" class="subhead"&gt;1. Walking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two experts I spoke with each said the easiest way to clock those five daily minutes for brain health is by walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking is No. 1, because that’s the easiest,” said E. Todd Schroeder, professor of clinical physical therapy and the director of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://sites.usc.edu/cerc/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clinical Exercise Research Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at USC. Very sedentary older adults may want to start with simple flat-ground walking at their normal pace, Schroeder says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re already a steady, regular walker, kick up the pace to elevate your heart rate into that all-important moderate category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A brisk walk is considered to be moderate activity,” said Rob Musci, an assistant professor of health and human sciences at Loyola Marymount University. On a scale of 1 to 10, moderate exercise is what you would consider being in the 4 to 6 range, Musci said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve a real huff-and-puff workout, walking or hiking briskly uphill is excellent, Schroeder said, because it also necessarily requires walking back down hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That interval-type training is good,” he said, “where your heart rate goes up for a time then comes back down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="2-swimming" class="subhead"&gt;2. Swimming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swimming is a terrific way to get a full-body workout and raise your heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s easy on the joints,” Shroeder said. “Even if you struggle with the technique of swimming, you can put on fins and get some at least moderate exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="3-cycling" class="subhead"&gt;3. Cycling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cycling can be on a stationary bike or an outdoor bike, many of which are now battery-assisted, making pedaling up hills almost too easy. One reason I like old-fashioned outdoor bikes, sans batteries, is that they also train balance and require your brain to keep you safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="4-resistance-training" class="subhead"&gt;4. Resistance training&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifting weights is one of the best ways to maintain muscle strength as we age, Musci said. Try these simple exercises you can easily do at home in fewer than three minutes.

But new research suggests that older adults can significantly improve brain health with only a few minutes of daily movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of South Australia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the U.S.-based &lt;a href="https://www.adventhealth.com/institute/adventhealth-research-institute" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AdventHealth Research Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;AdventHealth Research Institute&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that as few as five minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise a day correlated to significantly better cognitive performance. The study, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/4/afaf072/8106300?#511478665" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;published&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the British journal &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Age &amp;amp; Ageing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Age &amp;amp; Ageing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in early April, examined data from hundreds of people 65 to 80 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers found that "huff-and-puff" movements, like running or lap swimming, were associated with better brain functions including information processing, focusing and multitasking and short-term memory. They also found that even a few minutes of moderate exercise like walking improves brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our key finding was that moving from doing zero minutes or very little moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to doing just five minutes a day — that's where the biggest gain in cognitive function was seen,” said the study’s lead author, Maddison Mellow, a research associate at the University of South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers distinguished between moderate and vigorous exercise by applying a simple test: whether subjects could still manage to speak full sentences after moving around. Vigorous exercise makes that impossible, said Audrey Collins, a postdoctoral research scientist at AdventHealth Research Institute and the paper’s co-lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study observed 585 people, all in good health. Their physical activity was measured using accelerometers they wore on their wrists; the researchers tested cognitive functions using online and paper-based tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Worth noting: This study also found a “strong relationship” between spending little to no time doing moderate to vigorous activity and poorer cognitive performance, Mellow said. One slightly surprising finding, she added, was that the cognitive performance gains from exercise don’t extend to longer-term memory and visual-spatial functions like judging distances or sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study was novel in that it categorized how people divided their days into three behaviors: sleep, sedentary and active. And though &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041610225002704" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:getting enough quality sleep is important to brain health in midlife;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;getting enough quality sleep is important to brain health in midlife&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, the researchers said that when forced to choose between minutes spent sleeping and minutes spent exercising, reducing sleep time to spend more time moving resulted in better brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It didn't really matter, in this sample, where time was coming from, whether from sleep, sedentary behavior or light intensity physical activity,” Mellow said. “So long as time was being increased in moderate vigorous activity, that's where the benefits were being shown for cognitive outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With that in mind, what are some moderate or vigorous bursts of exercise for older adults to do every day? We consulted experts to give you five accessible options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;1. Walking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two experts I spoke with each said the easiest way to clock those five daily minutes for brain health is by walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Walking is No. 1, because that’s the easiest,” said E. Todd Schroeder, professor of clinical physical therapy and the director of the &lt;a href="https://sites.usc.edu/cerc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clinical Exercise Research Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clinical Exercise Research Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at USC. Very sedentary older adults may want to start with simple flat-ground walking at their normal pace, Schroeder says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re already a steady, regular walker, kick up the pace to elevate your heart rate into that all-important moderate category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A brisk walk is considered to be moderate activity,” said Rob Musci, an assistant professor of health and human sciences at Loyola Marymount University. On a scale of 1 to 10, moderate exercise is what you would consider being in the 4 to 6 range, Musci said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To achieve a real huff-and-puff workout, walking or hiking briskly uphill is excellent, Schroeder said, because it also necessarily requires walking back down hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That interval-type training is good,” he said, “where your heart rate goes up for a time then comes back down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;2. Swimming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Swimming is a terrific way to get a full-body workout and raise your heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s easy on the joints,” Shroeder said. “Even if you struggle with the technique of swimming, you can put on fins and get some at least moderate exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;3. Cycling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cycling can be on a stationary bike or an outdoor bike, many of which are now battery-assisted, making pedaling up hills almost too easy. One reason I like old-fashioned outdoor bikes, sans batteries, is that they also train balance and require your brain to keep you safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;4. Resistance training&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lifting weights is one of the best ways to maintain muscle strength as we age, Musci said. Try these simple exercises you can easily do at home in fewer than three minutes. They include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tossing a weighted ball from one hand to another (try it standing on one leg)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Squats holding a kettlebell, dumbbell, a bag of oranges or nothing at all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Weighted chest presses in boat pose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;5. Gardening and housework&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gardening can be a great way to engage core muscles, encourage flexibility and practice fine motor skills. Even basic house cleaning, like scrubbing a bathtub or mopping a floor, can qualify as moderate exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Anything that gets your heart going is what we’re looking for,” Musci said. “You hear about all these high-end interventions, fitness programs and boot camps, but in reality, it’s just movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The most important thing, he said, is “just getting off the couch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;on Zielbauer is the creator of &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://agingwithstrength.substack.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aging With Strength;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Aging With Strength&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; on Substack.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/newsletters/the-wild?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=newsletter_module&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the-wild" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up for The Wild newsletter to get weekly insider tips on the best of our beaches, trails, parks, deserts, forests and mountains.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Sign up for The Wild newsletter to get weekly insider tips on the best of our beaches, trails, parks, deserts, forests and mountains.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This story originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2025-05-19/5-minute-intense-daily-exercises-improve-brain-function-aging" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Los Angeles Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPcmdPNFA5V3NmSGFQMXR4RmVSVUtJeGRKLVhYZ25vXzFoLUwtd2x1elptTkNSLTlUbG1kS3FPblJyenZ0NnV5b1EtS0x5UGVDUUstZU54dFJVRUlCc0hiRjU1WHozUVRwcUJBZm5UcVRoRkQzYnRXQ25VNS1wb0dZbw</guid></item><item><title>“我被吓死了” |温伯利居民回忆起她家中的狐狸袭击事件- KVUE | 'I was scared to death' | Wimberley resident recalls fox attack inside her home - KVUE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNVVhJT1Q0T09lczhyY2p0b19XTE01UFhvSU9JeS1wYm9BYU8wLVo0S2xzNmg2dkgxeTlnTjVFSWh0T0V0bktVNFZXbWNhcFd5d24tUEhpeEluRkhzckFUZGlzNG82LVJWYXhOZWl6UElZalk3a05YRVVDRkZlZGZQaEQ0ODBickl1blhnOV9CSmFEZ3FadXhSaGY0WXo5Y0FraS0wckNlZDg2VzZpN1J6X1ZzeTdtVThh?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Linda Hasselberg shared her experience after a rabid fox entered her home and attacked her dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WIMBERLEY, Texas — "Freaky Friday" is how Wimberley resident Linda Hasselberg describes Friday, May 9. She said she had opened the door to let out her dogs, Chico and Mindy, when a fox entered her home. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They all ran under the bed, and all I heard then was barking and screeching and craziness. And I was hollering at the dogs to come out," Hasselberg said. "Chico was – I thought he was being eaten. I was scared to death."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasselberg called the Hays County Sheriff's Office (HCSO), but she said the fox left before help arrived. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He was screeching, you know, the way foxes – the sound that they make when they're upset. And he [was] kind of doing this lunging thing forward, and then he took off. Just trotted off," Hasselberg said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasselberg believes the fox got in through a small opening in her back fence. She later found out that a fox also&lt;a href="/article/news/health/rabid-fox-wimberley-hays-county-texas/269-0af807fd-8a8e-4cee-aad4-50a588b2c353"&gt; bit&lt;/a&gt; her neighbor the same day and that the fox tested positive for rabies. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasselberg took her dogs to the vet to get their boosters. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't even think I realized how important it is to have the rabies vaccine," she said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clint Pulpan, a lieutenant with the HCSO's Community Services division, said pet owners need to make sure their animals' vaccines are up-to-date. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slew of incidents involving &lt;a href="/article/news/health/fox-attack-rabies-san-marcos-purgatory-creek/269-7edad2bd-386a-47e1-b1ef-5aea61f38fc6"&gt;suspected rabid foxes&lt;/a&gt; also happened on May 11 in San Marcos near the Purgatory Creek Natural Area. Four people reported contact with a fox near various trails, according to San Marcos officials. Two of those people were bitten by a fox and all four received medical treatment. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulpan calls these recent incidents "concerning."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From what I was told, historically, I don't know how long ago, but there was like an outbreak of rabid foxes and then the state got that under control," Pulpan said. "And what we're concerned about now: is this coming back?"&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm just very thankful to the Lord that he didn't get any closer to me than he did and to the dogs," Hasselberg said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you or your pet have touched a rabid animal, call your local animal control agency for help. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

In a global sample we found that more than half of sleep sessions end in a snooze alarm, and users spent an average of 11 minutes in between snooze alarms each morning before waking,” said lead author Rebecca Robbins, PhD, in the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reliance upon snooze varied by day of the week, with more snooze alarm during the typical work week (Monday through Friday) with the lowest snooze alarm utilization on Saturday and Sunday mornings.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Snooze alarm utilization was lower among those sleeping five or fewer hours. According to the researchers, this could be because short sleepers are cutting sleep short due to occupational responsibilities, which would require them to wake up and start their day, leaving little time for a snooze. Heavy users of the snooze alarm (those relying on snooze alarm on more than 80% of mornings studied) spent on average 20 minutes in between snooze alarms. Heavy snooze alarm users also demonstrated more erratic sleep schedules than other categories of users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;People in the U.S., Sweden and Germany had the highest snooze button use, while those living in Japan and Australia had the lowest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Unfortunately, the snooze alarm disrupts some of the most important stages of sleep,” said Robbins. “The hours just before waking are rich in rapid eye movement sleep. Hitting the snooze alarm will interrupt these critical stages of sleep and typically only offer you light sleep in between snooze alarms. The best approach for optimizing your sleep and next day performance is to set your alarm for the latest possible time, then commit to getting out of bed when your first alarm goes off.”&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;\r\n\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Authorship: &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;In addition to Robbins, Mass General Brigham authors include Matthew D.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleep experts recommend against snoozing after a wake-up alarm, but a study led by researchers at Mass General Brigham shows the practice is common, with more than 50% of sleep sessions logged ending in a snooze alarm and users spending 11 minutes on average snoozing &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though using the snooze function on an alarm clock isn’t recommended by sleep experts, it’s a common practice, according to a new study led by researchers at Mass General Brigham. Using data from the sleep analysis app Sleep Cycle, researchers analyzed sleep data from more than 21,000 people around the world. The snooze button was pressed in close to 56% of the 3 million nights studied. Around 45% of study subjects hit the snooze button on more than 80% of mornings. These heavy users snoozed, on average, 20 minutes a day.  Results are published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99563-y" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Eating healthy sounds great, but cutting back on meat, let alone going vegetarian is way easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the road to healthy eating doesn't have to include dramatic changes or big sacrifices. You can ease your way into it. That's according to chef Dan Souza&lt;a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Souza helped &lt;em&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/em&gt;'s Leila Fadel make &lt;a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/12518-rigatoni-with-quick-mushroom-bolognese" target="_blank"&gt;rigatoni with quick mushroom Bolognese&lt;/a&gt;, one of the recipes from &lt;em&gt;Mostly Meatless: Green Up Your Plate Without Totally Ditching the Meat.&lt;/em&gt; The new cookbook was produced by &lt;a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/" target="_blank"&gt;America's Test Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, where Souza serves as chief content officer. The 200-some featured dishes are designed to whet the appetites of committed vegetarians and those who might be "veggie-curious."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's really about moving meat a little bit off from the center of the plate," Souza said. "Many of the recipes include just a small amount of meat that provides tons of flavor and texture and you don't miss out on any of the comfort."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaty taste and texture without the meat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of times when we get intense meatiness and savoriness, it's from other ingredients that are included with the meat," Souza said. He pointed out that a chicken breast, for example, is very plain on its own and actually derives its flavor from all the other ingredients with which it's cooked, like soy sauce, salt, lemon or vinegar. "So you can use those ingredients and a much smaller amount of, say, that chicken breast and you get something that is super savory, super enjoyable," he added. "It's not really about the meat in that instance."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaty taste from those sticky brown bits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sautéing meat or vegetables (or even fruit) produces brown, glazed bits at the bottom of the pan known as "fond." These bits can form the foundation of any recipe, and are a source of flavor and aroma in what's known as a Maillard reaction. "You hear a lot of chefs talk about it, but it's essentially when proteins and sugars are involved with high heat, you get like hundreds of new flavor compounds and aroma," Souza said. "Think of a loaf of bread, that browning on the outside or the browning on the edges of a steak. It's responsible for some of the most flavorful foods that we eat."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can't get no satisfaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A lot of people complain they still feel hungry five minutes after eating a mostly-vegetarian meal. Souza said the secret to satisfaction is fiber, which can provide a feeling of fullness for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Fiber and really complex carbohydrates are very slow to digest, which is really great for a number of reasons," Souza explained. "Fiber doesn't cause glucose spikes, which give you that very heavy feeling that makes it hard to go back to work after a meaty lunch."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cooking and eating mostly meatless may line up with many dietary recommendations, but "it's also a way to eat in my mind that just makes you feel really good," Souza said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/1096013390/olivia-hampton" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Olivia Hampton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; edited the radio and digital version of this story.&lt;/p&gt;

The bad news: people are finding ticks everywhere, especially on themselves and their pets. The good news: so far there aren't huge numbers of reported illnesses or diseases due to ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But that will probably change — unless people take precautions, and even then there's a chance a tick bite could lead to an infection, or even a virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Lately there's not only been a ton of calls, but field staff are collecting tons," said Lee Green, senior medical entomologist at the &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/health/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Indiana Department of Health (IDOT)&lt;/a&gt;, about this year's tick populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;At this point in the year, Green said ticks are mostly in the nymph stage, which means they are smaller than the adults and harder to spot when they're crawling on people or pets. While the infection rate for adult ticks is double that of nymphs, Green said nymphs transmit more diseases to people because they are so small and are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We see the most Lyme disease in humans during the season of nymphs," he said. "They're starting to come out now," which means the IDOH is trying to spread information about prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/21/NHEN/74173589007-ticks-and-dime-monroe-county.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=495&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/21/NHEN/74173589007-ticks-and-dime-monroe-county.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=990&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="These ticks, 4 lone star adult females, 5 lone star adult males and 57 lone star nymphs, were found in Monroe County in May 2024 by Monroe County Health Department employee Kody Clark.

Gulf Coast ticks can be found as far north as Hamilton County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They look very similar to the American dog tick," Green said. "Right now they are found in 14 counties from central Indiana to the southwestern part of the state. The more we look for (Gulf Coast ticks), the more we find it in other areas, as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Asian longhorned tick is the newest in Indiana and was the first tick "to invade the whole U.S." in the past 80 years, according to Green. So far the Asian tick has been found only in Switzerland, Ohio, Dubois and Spencer counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While Asian longhorned ticks don't usually bite people, they are a problem for livestock. Green said that in lab conditions, the ticks can transmit human pathogens but that hasn't been identified anywhere else. It does transmit a parasite that's detrimental to cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/12/NHEN/83580191007-dr-adams-1.png?width=300&amp;amp;height=420&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/12/NHEN/83580191007-dr-adams-1.png?width=600&amp;amp;height=840&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Dr. Robert Adams is an emergency medicine physician with Indiana University Health Bloomington."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Dr. Robert Adams is an emergency medicine physician with Indiana University Health Bloomington." data-c-credit="Courtesy Photo/IU Health"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. Robert Adams, emergency medicine physician with IU Health Bloomington, said Indiana has between 300 and 400 tick-related cases each year. While hundreds of cases of tick-borne illness may seem like a lot, Adams said that's a low number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lyme disease is one of the most common, with most cases in the northwest part of Indiana. After a tick with Lyme disease bites a person, they will usually develop a "target" rash that is red in the center, surrounded by a circle of white and then circle of red — similar to a target. Rocky Mountain spotted fever and ehrlichiosis are two of the most common illnesses found in southern Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Ticks can transmit viruses, and a meat allergy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A new worry for Hoosiers is that some ticks are carrying two types of virus that they can transmit to people. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bourbon-virus/about/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bourbon virus&lt;/a&gt;, named for the Kansas county were it was first found, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/about/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Powassan virus&lt;/a&gt; leave people feeling achy and feverish, with fatigue, rash and headache. For these, antibiotics won't work, Adams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It will just have to run its course," he said, adding it's not known if there are any long-lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Another malady ticks can pass on to people is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alpha-gal-syndrome/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;alpha-gal syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which is an allergy to red meat. After an infected tick bites a person, it leaves behind a sugar molecule in the bloodstream that triggers a new immune response. If that person eats food that contains a-gal (red meat and other mammalian products), they have an allergic reaction that can range from hives and an upset stomach to life-threatening anaphylaxis. There's no way of knowing who has the allergy until they develop a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adams said some people with alpha-gal can still eat chicken, but most can no longer eat beef or pork. He believes some people may actually have the allergy and not know it, suffering heartburn or hives and not realizing the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I'm finding more and more people have it," he said. The way to know for sure is to have an antibody blood test taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Green explained that alpha-gal is transmitted by lone star ticks. In Indiana there were two pockets of lone star ticks — near Lake Michigan and a larger population in southern Indiana. But those two populations are growing and coming together, becoming more common in and around Monroe County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What ticks are found in Indiana, Monroe County?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/30/PWIL/83370889007-2-blacklegged-tick-ixodes-scapularis-female.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=305&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/30/PWIL/83370889007-2-blacklegged-tick-ixodes-scapularis-female.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=610&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Microscope image of a Blacklegged tick."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Microscope image of a Blacklegged tick." data-c-credit="Provided By Delaware DNREC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Indiana has six &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/health/idepd/zoonotic-and-vectorborne-epidemiology-entomology/vector-borne-diseases/tick-borne-diseases/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ticks that spread diseases and illnesses to people&lt;/a&gt;.

The tick also transmits &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alpha-gal-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20428608" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;alpha-gal syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Asian longhorned tick&lt;/strong&gt; has only been found in four southern Indiana counties and there are no reports of any diseases transmitted to people by this tick. However, it is a concern for cattle and other livestock.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kody Clark, with the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/department/?structureid=12" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt;, said as of May 8, his agency has received reports of 20 American dog ticks and 18 lone star ticks. The reports were delivered to the health department through its Citizen Tick Reporter Web app, at &lt;a href="https://tinyurl.com/tr4ykamr" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;https://tinyurl.com/tr4ykamr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/21/NHEN/74173590007-ticks-drag-cloth-monroe-county.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/21/NHEN/74173590007-ticks-drag-cloth-monroe-county.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Kody Clark, an employee at the Monroe County Health Department, uses a drag cloth to capture ticks in Bloomington area parks in May 2024."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Kody Clark, an employee at the Monroe County Health Department, uses a drag cloth to capture ticks in Bloomington area parks in May 2024." data-c-credit="Courtesy Photo/Kody Clark"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Clark said the most common places people reported finding American dog ticks were inside their homes. Most lone star ticks were discovered on people's skin. Clark anticipated more reports through June and hopes people will use the app to report what ticks they have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While Clark hasn't seen any reports of Gulf Coast ticks in Monroe County, he believes they are present because they are established in Lawrence, Greene and Hendricks counties, according to IDOH maps. "It is just a matter of finding and identifying them," he said in an email. "The Asian longhorned tick is another one on our radar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Clark will be using drag cloths this month in Bloomington-area parks to get a better idea of which ticks are prevalent in the area. Last year, Clark found mostly lone star ticks, followed by the American dog tick and then the black-legged tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Ways to prevent tick bites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Green and Adams agree that preventing ticks from being nearby or having a chance to latch on to a person are the best ways to avoid illnesses. And now is the time to start prevention measures, with Adams stating, "We're not seeing a lot in the ER but we're being told that people are picking off ticks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/30/PWIL/83370929007-3-american-dog-tick-dermacentor-variabilis-female-dorsal.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=470&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/30/PWIL/83370929007-3-american-dog-tick-dermacentor-variabilis-female-dorsal.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=940&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Microscopic image of an American Dog tick."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Microscopic image of an American Dog tick." data-c-credit="Provided By Delaware DNREC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts that have been sprayed with .5% permethrin is the best defense when outside. Spraying exposed skin with repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-methane-diol are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Green also recommends boot gaiters soaked in permethrin for people who walk in tall grassy areas. The gaiters help keep ticks on the outside of clothes, just as tucking pants legs into socks does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Doing a check for ticks after being outside, even in your yard, is a good idea. Green said black-legged ticks (also known as deer ticks) like to "feed where they land." Sometimes that can be hard-to-see places such as the back of a person's knee. And if it's a nymph, it's even more difficult to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Keeping ticks out of your yard&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Even if a person doesn't get a disease from a tick, if it bites them, Green said there can be infections that can cause future health issues. Again, he emphasized prevention is best, adding people can do more by making modifications to their landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2023/08/03/PELM/70522968007-deertick.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=447&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="The black-legged tick, also called the deer tick or bear tick, is a carrier of Borrelia burgdorfi bacteria, which causes Lyme disease."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="The black-legged tick, also called the deer tick or bear tick, is a carrier of Borrelia burgdorfi bacteria, which causes Lyme disease." data-c-credit="Jim Gathany / Centers For Disease Control And Prevention"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ticks need high humidity because they absorb water vapor through their mouth parts. Take away the humidity and ticks will disappear. Mowed grass that has sunshine to dry it out and doing away with ground covers that hold in moisture will help. Place swing sets and play areas in sunny areas, not shade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Residences with wooded, shady areas can create areas where ticks are less likely to thrive by building a physical barrier with gravel or wood chips near play areas or patios. Green said pets and deer, and even people, can transport ticks across the gravel or wood chips, so be aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What to do after a tick bite?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you do find a tick that's attached and not just crawling on your skin, IU Health's Dr. Adams suggests removing it carefully to ensure the whole tick is removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adams advises people to take a "watch and wait approach" if they find a tick. If a tick hasn't been attached for more than 48 hours, it's unlikely it will transmit a disease. However, it can take one to two weeks before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The prevalence of tick-borne illnesses is kind-of low," he said. "The odds are that you're not going to get anything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But if symptoms (rash, fever, swelling of the bite site) do appear, Adams said it's best to go to a walk-in or urgent care clinic. Antibiotics given quickly can help lessen the impact of any transmitted diseases for most people and a blood test can be taken to identify the exact illnesses if needed, Adams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Remember, alpha-gal and the new viruses cannot be treated with antibiotics, Adams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contact Carol Kugler at ckugler@heraldt.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Herald-Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 08:54:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxQNXlJZFFNTlFpT0dQa0RsWnhXQWYtZXlVUzhnMUMxS296Qkppam9iMnhCcXhzQm1BdFIzRDd0MFR4bXBqdnBlZWxEeFdjWm1RQXc0aENLWnA4SU1PWUpfRFBKWVNkRzAzUE5DVjdsQ3ZPVXFpUTdYeDFlZG45MmxSR3dSc2pWQnYtWUZSMTZsc3dIbmJMWDhhQjRseWJ3bjBrdjBnQ21JWjdPSDhVVm4zZ21vakJ0c21mbFdKekZBeFAzUnhwWm1rc1N0WC04VnRTM0NLUklZMTh6Ti1ZSk9tOG9Bdw</guid></item><item><title>美国已有3个月没有出现人类禽流感病例。专家们想知道为什么- Medical Xpress | The US hasn't seen a human bird flu case in 3 months.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration's deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We just don't know why there haven't been cases," said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. "I think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren't being detected."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H5N1 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bird+flu/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S.—most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/infected+people/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;infected people&lt;/a&gt; had mild illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in &lt;a href="https://www.centralnevadahd.org/press-release/" target="_blank"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/ODH-News-Releases/ohio-reports-first-human-case-of-bird-flu-021225" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://health.wyo.gov/wyomings-first-human-bird-flu-case-confirmed/" target="_blank"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation's infections in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dairy+cattle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dairy cattle&lt;/a&gt;. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The possible natural reason bird flu cases are down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural—maybe temporary—decline in cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" target="_blank"&gt;limited activity&lt;/a&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New infections are still being detected in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, but not as frequently as several months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Given the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it's not surprising that human cases have declined as well," the CDC said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are government cuts affecting bird flu monitoring?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn't concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"I don't think that anybody's hiding anything," said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government's bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said "targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can't argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;h2&gt;CDC says the risk to the general public remains low&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/wild+birds/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;wild birds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pandemic-flu/php/monitoring/irat-virus-summaries.html" target="_blank"&gt;an agency assessment&lt;/a&gt; said there is a "moderate risk" that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, research is continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have had very good participation," Douphrate said. "They have been very willing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar surveillance is "urgently needed" among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/domestic+cats/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;domestic cats&lt;/a&gt; infected with the virus across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu—or whether the virus can spill over into people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coleman has been collecting &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's easy to downplay something because that's usually what humans do," she said. "But what we really need to be doing is ramping up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study after study gets spiked because it “no longer effectuates agency priorities.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the research hints at diversity, equity, or inclusion, the wording gets a little nasty, in the view of neurologist Charles DeCarli, chair in Alzheimer’s research at the University of California, Davis. His $53 million inquiry into how vascular factors contribute to dementia among white, Black, and Hispanic people was terminated in March.&lt;/p&gt;

That is a process that breaks down glucose for energy and supports cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;“This study is one of the first to show that taurine may actually help drive cancer growth,” Bajaj said. “Leukemia cells hijack taurine to fuel their survival.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Jane Liesvaeld, M.D., a Wilmot oncologist and co-author of the study, has urged caution when it comes to taurine supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;The amino acid is a common ingredient in energy drinks, protein powders, and certain foods.

Just sixty years ago, over 90% of children would have been infected by it, and of those who developed symptoms, around a quarter would be hospitalized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-1" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The United States alone had around three to four million cases annually, leading to tens of thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths each year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-2" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, in 1963, John Enders developed the first effective measles vaccine. Vaccination efforts ramped up rapidly in richer countries, and in the 1970s and 1980s, they were scaled up worldwide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In just the last fifty years, it’s estimated that measles vaccinations have prevented over ninety million deaths worldwide. Two to three million people would die from measles every year without them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-3" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; This means these vaccines are likely the most life-saving ones currently in use, as you can see in the chart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-4" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this article, I explain how measles vaccines were developed and their impact on saving lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="the-introduction-of-the-measles-vaccine-led-to-a-substantial-decline-in-cases"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The introduction of the measles vaccine led to a substantial decline in cases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#the-introduction-of-the-measles-vaccine-led-to-a-substantial-decline-in-cases"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;John Enders and his colleagues developed the first measles vaccine. Enders had previously played a key role in research for the development of polio vaccines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-5" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and in 1954, his team turned its attention to measles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They collected samples from throat swabs and blood from infected school children during an outbreak. The researchers successfully isolated the measles virus from one sample, naming it the “Edmonston strain” after the young boy it came from.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-6" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next challenge was weakening or “attenuating” the virus so it could trigger immunity without causing disease. Enders and his colleagues experimented with growing the virus in human kidney cells and then in fertilized chicken eggs, forcing it to adapt to different environments. By repeating this process many times, the virus lost its ability to cause severe disease in humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-7" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first human trials in 1960 were successful: school children given the vaccine developed strong immunity and were protected against the virus. However, the vaccine still caused fever and rash in many children. To reduce these side effects, doctors gave children “measles immune globulin” alongside the vaccine to blunt its impact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-7" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="body-3-medium-italic article-block__aside-right col-start-11 span-cols-3 span-md-cols-10 col-md-start-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles immune globulin is a concentrated preparation of antibodies against measles taken from donated blood, used to provide short-term passive immunity or soften the body’s reaction to the vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maurice Hilleman, a microbiologist who developed over 40 vaccines in his lifetime, improved the measles vaccine. In the 1960s, he further weakened the measles virus by growing it in chick embryo cells at lower temperatures, creating an even safer version. It was licensed in 1968 and became the standard measles vaccine. A few years later, in 1971, he developed the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) combination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-8" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The impact of measles vaccination was rapid and substantial. Analysis of over a hundred studies shows that the vaccines reduce the chances of developing measles twenty-fold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-9" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can see the impact of vaccination in the United States in the heatmap below. Each row is one state, and the colors represent the number of reported cases over time. In the first half of the 20th century, measles rates were high, and the years are shown in dark blue, but the number of cases rapidly dropped due to vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-block__image article-block__image--wide col-start-4 span-cols-8 col-md-start-2 span-md-cols-12"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-block__image-caption col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explore this data in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/reported-measles-case-rate-by-state-in-the-united-states" class="span-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;an interactive chart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="deaths-remained-common-in-poorer-countries-until-vaccines-became-widely-available"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deaths remained common in poorer countries until vaccines became widely available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#deaths-remained-common-in-poorer-countries-until-vaccines-became-widely-available"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other factors have also played a role in the reduction in measles deaths. In the US, deaths had already been falling in the decades before — probably due to better treatment for the secondary infectious diseases that people with measles become vulnerable to, improved sanitation and hygiene that limited the spread of those infections, and better childhood nutrition, which lowered the risk of severe illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-10" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, these improvements were not effective in reducing measles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;cases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The measles virus is airborne, so improvements in hygiene, such as clean water or better sewage systems, do not reduce its spread. Since measles is so contagious, nearly every child still got measles before vaccines were available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-11" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and the number of cases only began to decline after the vaccines arrived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet this doesn’t mean these cases were mild: before vaccines were available, there were still around 50,000 hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths in just the United States each year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-2" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In contrast, measles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;deaths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; continued to be common in poorer countries until vaccines became widely available. In the chart below, you can see that hundreds of thousands of people died from measles annually in Africa and South-East Asia between the 1980s and 2000s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s because, in low- and middle-income countries, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dod-span" data-id="case-fatality-rate" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;case fatality rate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; from measles has been much higher than in richer countries. It’s estimated that in the 1980s, 5 to 10% of children with the disease then died from it. This would have been particularly severe when widespread measles outbreaks infected most children in the population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-12" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The number of measles deaths dropped dramatically in the 2000s, particularly in Africa, as vaccination efforts scaled up, as we’ll see in the following section.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="measles-vaccination-saves-millions-of-lives-each-year"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles vaccination saves millions of lives each year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#measles-vaccination-saves-millions-of-lives-each-year"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The global rollout of measles vaccines has been one of history’s most successful public health efforts.

It shows the share of one-year-olds who have received their first dose of the measles vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1980s, coverage was very low in many parts of the world, especially in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean. In some countries, like Yemen, only 2% of children received vaccines; in Spain, only 8%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But since then, vaccination rates have increased rapidly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One reason is the scale-up of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/essential-programme-on-immunization" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Expanded Programme on Immunization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by the World Health Assembly from the 1970s, which aimed to vaccinate children against the deadliest infectious diseases, including measles. Vaccination efforts reached more than 90 million children — or 60% of all infants — by the early 2000s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But millions of children were still left behind, particularly in poorer countries.

This was not because of poor hygiene or healthcare, but because of how contagious measles is. Without immunity, each infected person would typically pass it to more than a dozen others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-14" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, making sanitation and hygiene measures alone insufficient to control its spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The breakthrough came when researchers isolated and weakened the virus, creating a safe and effective vaccine. Over the following decades, measles vaccination was scaled up globally, reaching hundreds of millions of children and preventing an estimated 90 million deaths in the last fifty years — more than any other childhood vaccine used today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles vaccination does more than prevent the disease. It preserves a child’s broader immunity and protects those most at risk, including infants, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems from health conditions or undergoing cancer treatments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also prevents the virus from spreading. When most people are immune, the virus runs into dead ends. Chains of transmission are broken before they can grow. As a result, outbreaks have become smaller, easier to contain, and increasingly rare. But keeping it this way requires high vaccination rates: the best way to stop a measles outbreak is to prevent it from ever starting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="continue-reading-on-our-world-in-data"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Continue reading on Our World in Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#continue-reading-on-our-world-in-data"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a class="article-block__prominent-link grid grid-cols-6 span-cols-6 col-start-5 span-md-cols-10 col-md-start-3 grid-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2 grid-sm-cols-12 prominent-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/measles-vaccine-effectiveness-safety"&gt;&lt;div class="col-sm-start-4 col-md-start-3 col-start-2 col-end-limit"&gt;&lt;p class="prominent-link__heading-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h3 class="h3-bold"&gt;How effective and safe are measles vaccines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-3-medium"&gt;Data from large meta-analyses show that measles vaccination is highly effective and safe, giving a 95% reduction in the risk of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="article-block__prominent-link grid grid-cols-6 span-cols-6 col-start-5 span-md-cols-10 col-md-start-3 grid-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2 grid-sm-cols-12 prominent-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccines-children-saved"&gt;&lt;div class="col-sm-start-4 col-md-start-3 col-start-2 col-end-limit"&gt;&lt;p class="prominent-link__heading-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h3 class="h3-bold"&gt;Vaccines have saved 150 million children over the last 50 years&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-3-medium"&gt;Every ten seconds, one child is saved by a vaccine against a fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="article-block__prominent-link grid grid-cols-6 span-cols-6 col-start-5 span-md-cols-10 col-md-start-3 grid-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2 grid-sm-cols-12 prominent-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/microbes-battle-science-vaccines"&gt;&lt;div class="col-sm-start-4 col-md-start-3 col-start-2 col-end-limit"&gt;&lt;p class="prominent-link__heading-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h3 class="h3-bold"&gt;Our history is a battle against the microbes: we lost terribly before science, public health, and vaccines allowed us to protect ourselves&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-3-medium"&gt;For most of our history, we were losing terribly against the microbes.

    &lt;p&gt;Last week the World Health Organisation (WHO) &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-16/papua-new-guinea-polio-outbreak-and-risk-to-australia-explained/105298232"&gt;declared a polio outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Papua New Guinea (PNG). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highly infectious virus was found in two healthy, polio-vaccinated children who were screened following detection of the virus during routine wastewater sampling in Lae, PNG’s second largest city. Wastewater samples are also positive in the capital Port Moresby, indicating the potential of spread around the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strain has been identified as circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2, similar genetically to a strain &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380438/Polio-Bulletin-2025-No-04.pdf?sequence=41"&gt;circulating in Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean? And what will happen now in PNG?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1922893663857787094"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;First, what is polio?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polio, or &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/poliomyelitis#tab=tab_1"&gt;poliomyelitis&lt;/a&gt;, is a highly contagious disease caused by the poliovirus. It primarily affects children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most infections don’t cause significant symptoms and go largely unnoticed. But &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/about-polio/the-virus/"&gt;less than 1%&lt;/a&gt; of infections result in paralysis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poliovirus &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/poliomyelitis/facts"&gt;is spread&lt;/a&gt; by person-to-person contact or the ingestion of contaminated virus from faeces. The virus multiplies in the gut of people who are infected, and they shed the virus in their stool for several weeks. In this way it can spread through a community, especially in areas with poor sanitation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39163109/"&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt; also suggested a greater role for transmission via respiratory particles than we previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild poliovirus (as distinct from vaccine-derived poliovirus, which we’ll discuss shortly) was a major public health issue prior to the rollout of vaccination in 1950s. This campaign led to the virtual elimination of the disease in rich &lt;a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/ea7684ff-753c-44db-9091-24654db8b6b1/aihw-phe-236_polio.pdf.aspx"&gt;countries such as Australia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/who-we-are/partners/"&gt;Global Polio Eradication Initiative&lt;/a&gt; was launched &lt;a href="https://nationaltraumacentre.gov.au/news/unravelling-the-legacy-of-polio-from-historical-origins-to-global-eradication-initiatives/"&gt;in 1988&lt;/a&gt;, cases have &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/about-polio/history-of-polio/"&gt;decreased by 99%&lt;/a&gt; globally. Wild poliovirus remains endemic only in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/poliomyelitis#tab=tab_1"&gt;Pakistan and Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Polio is caused by the poliovirus.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/poliovirus-rna-virus-picornaviridae-family-that-2135714785"&gt;Kateryna Kon/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Polio vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://my.klarity.health/how-does-the-poliovirus-vaccine-work-and-what-types-are-available/"&gt;two types of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; – the oral polio vaccine and the inactivated polio vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivered as two drops in the mouth at least &lt;a href="https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/EssDr/english/oral-poliomyelitis-vaccine-opv-16687789.html"&gt;four times in early childhood&lt;/a&gt;, the oral vaccine contains a live-attenuated (weakened) form of the poliovirus. It triggers a strong immune reaction in the gut that slows the replication of wild poliovirus, and reduces shedding in the stool, limiting transmission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oral vaccine does carry a small risk of the weakened vaccine strain causing paralysis. This occurs in 
roughly &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/gpei-cvdpv-factsheet-march-2017.pdf?sfvrsn=1ceef4af_2"&gt;one in 2.7 million doses&lt;/a&gt; of the oral vaccine administered, usually at the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inactivated polio vaccine (part of the routine immunisation program &lt;a href="https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/contents/vaccine-preventable-diseases/poliomyelitis#recommendations"&gt;in Australia&lt;/a&gt;) contains an inactivated or dead form of the poliovirus, which is unable to cause polio in the recipient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given as an injection, this vaccine stimulates the immune system to produce protective antibodies in the blood against poliovirus. Three doses of the inactivated vaccine are highly protective against developing symptoms and paralysis from polio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this vaccine is thought not to be as effective as the oral vaccine at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1473309923005054"&gt;preventing infection and shedding in the gut&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, it doesn’t prevent transmission.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is vaccine-derived poliovirus?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weakened poliovirus in the oral vaccine is still shed in the stool, it can spread in communities with poor sanitation. The vaccine strain can mutate to a form that can cause paralysis, like wild poliovirus. The result, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, is a problem particularly when polio immunisation rates are low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of international spread of vaccine-derived poliovirus has been assessed as high &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/10-04-2025-statement-of-the-forty-first-meeting-of-the-polio-ihr-emergency-committee"&gt;by the WHO&lt;/a&gt; and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were outbreaks &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a1.htm#:%7E:text=During%20January%202023%E2%80%93June%202024%2C%2074%20cVDPV%20outbreaks%20%28672,counts%20declined%20markedly%20compared%20with%20those%20during%202022"&gt;in 39 countries&lt;/a&gt; in 2023–24.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A novel oral polio vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/poliovirus-vaccines"&gt;nOPV2&lt;/a&gt;, which is less likely to mutate, has been used in outbreaks of vaccine-derived poliovirus since 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routine vaccination with the inactivated polio vaccine is key to preventing vaccine-derived poliovirus, and is &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/table1-summary-of-who-position-papers-recommendations-for-routine-immunization"&gt;recommended by WHO&lt;/a&gt;. The polio endgame will involve this &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8572547/"&gt;transition from the oral vaccine to the inactivated vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, all countries had &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/inactivated-polio-vaccine-now-introduced-worldwide"&gt;introduced the inactivated vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. However uptake remains low because of a lack of resources and inadequate access to health services in poor countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What happens now in PNG?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PNG government has &lt;a href="https://www.postcourier.com.pg/war-against-polio-starts/"&gt;responded swiftly&lt;/a&gt; to activate its polio emergency response plan, &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/eap/press-releases/unicef-supports-urgent-national-response-protect-every-child-life-threatening"&gt;supported by partners&lt;/a&gt; including WHO, UNICEF and the Australian government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, PNG’s vaccination rate is among the lowest in the world, with only about &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/png/stories/enhancing-routine-immunization-papua-new-guinea"&gt;50% of children&lt;/a&gt; born each year receiving the recommended childhood vaccines, including the oral polio vaccine. To induce herd immunity and prevent outbreaks of disease, coverage should be &lt;a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/what-unicef-does/childrens-health/immunization/polio#:%7E:text=Polio,%C2%A0a%20highly%20infectious%20viral%20disease"&gt;at least 95%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PNG was declared polio free &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-16/papua-new-guinea-polio-outbreak-and-risk-to-australia-explained/105298232"&gt;in 2000&lt;/a&gt;. But there was an &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/20-February-2019-polio-png-en"&gt;outbreak in 2018&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine-derived polio type 1 with 26 cases across nine provinces. The outbreak was brought under control through supplementary rounds of vaccination, enhanced surveillance, and expanded communication and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many lessons to be learned from the successful response to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/papuanewguinea/news/detail/25-03-2019-papua-new-guinea-polio-outbreak-response-report-for-2018-published"&gt;2018 polio outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. These three pillars of the response remain relevant: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mass vaccination (using nOPV2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enhanced surveillance for cases and wastewater sampling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;communication (through traditional and social media) and localised community engagement. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further research will be crucial to understand where transmission is occurring and target the response accordingly. This includes the question of potential for spread between Indonesia and PNG – a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1326020023002029"&gt;neglected health security issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;PNG previously experienced a polio outbreak in 2018.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Sam Mooy/AAP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How about the risk in Australia?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the risk of spread of polio in Australia is low, the virus does not respect borders, and we cannot become complacent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s overall coverage with the inactivated vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-16/papua-new-guinea-polio-outbreak-and-risk-to-australia-explained/105298232"&gt;is close to 95%&lt;/a&gt; but there has been a &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-16/childhood-vaccination-rates-falling-in-australia-since-covid/105296020"&gt;concerning decline in childhood immunisation&lt;/a&gt; since the COVID pandemic. Australia must address this and maintain its polio &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-11/poliovirus-detection-outbreak-response-plan-for-australia-2024.pdf"&gt;wastewater monitoring system&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting PNG and working with other countries towards global polio eradication is the best way Australia can protect itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outbreak is a timely reminder that the last mile in the global eradication of polio remains elusive. As we emerge from a pandemic, the need for international cooperation, strengthening health systems and responding swiftly to health emergencies such as polio couldn’t be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
