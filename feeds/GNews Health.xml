Researchers say positive results from around a dozen studies over the past three years suggest CAR-T-cell therapy could eventually be used treat any disease in which the immune system attacks the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAR-T-cell therapy exploits the immune system’s T cells that fight off infection: these cells are collected from a person and tweaked to produce proteins called chimeric antigen receptors. They are then reintroduced into the body to target antigens expressed by B cells, another type of immune cell. In autoimmune disorders, these B cells make antibodies that attack the body’s own healthy tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The use of the therapy for immune conditions has exploded since 2021, when a 20-year-old woman in Germany with severe lupus became the first person with an autoimmune disorder to be treated with CAR T cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Clinician–researcher David Simon, who was involved in that treatment&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, says the CAR-T therapies have since entered phase I and II clinical trials for autoimmune conditions including systemic sclerosis, myositis and rheumatoid arthritis. Phase III trials are also under way for lupus and myasthenia gravis, a condition that causes weakness in the muscles that are used to breathe, swallow and see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon, who focuses on rheumatoid arthritis at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, says people in CAR-T-cell therapy trials for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus seem to be ‘cured’. “They lose their autoantibodies which trigger the disease, and they don’t have any symptoms anymore,” he adds. “This is something totally new which we didn’t observe before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAR-T-cell therapy has become a routine treatment for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00241-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00241-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;several types of cancer&lt;/a&gt; since it was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22304" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22304" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;first approved&lt;/a&gt; to treat blood cancers in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new frontier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ulcerative colitis, a condition that affects the colon and causes stomach pain, ulcers and bloody diarrhoea, is one of the latest diseases in which CAR-T-cell therapy has shown promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, gastroenterologist Markus Neurath and his colleagues at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany, reported using CAR T cells to treat a 21-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After the treatment, she showed signs of remission that persisted for 14 weeks, no longer needed medication and could return to work. “The result was quite amazing,” adds Neurath. His team plans to test the treatment in a few more people before proceeding to a controlled clinical trial involving many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Bing Du, an immunologist at East China Normal University in Shanghai, and his team published the results of a CAR-T pilot study using immune cells from a donor to treat drug-resistant lupus&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Donor-derived cells could act like a generic version of CAR-T treatment that could be mass-produced, cutting manufacturing time and lowering costs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Last year, Du was also involved in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03209-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03209-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;world-first study&lt;/a&gt; of bioengineered and modified immune cells from a donor for the treatment of two rare and severe autoimmune diseases&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the latest study, four women with a form of lupus that affects multiple organs received chemotherapy to reduce levels of their white blood cells, followed by an infusion of donor-derived CAR T cells. After three months, the women no longer experienced symptoms such as arthritis, swelling of blood vessels and alopecia, and one was in remission and no longer needed any medication. The other three women received low-dose steroids as a maintenance therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the trial were “much better than we could imagine”, says Du, and might be due to CAR T cells triggering the total depletion of dysfunctional B cells that attack the body’s tissues. “The immune system had to reset not only B cells, but also the rest of the immune system,” he adds, potentially allowing new, healthy B cells to replace the dysfunctional cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Childhood – from birth to age nine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adolescence – from nine to 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adulthood – from 32 to 66&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early ageing – from 66 to 83&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late ageing – from 83 onwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-does-the-brain-shift-from-one-phase-to-the-next"&gt;When does the brain shift from one phase to the next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the brain adapts to new surroundings and situations between birth and old age, researchers found that four ages – nine, 32, 66 and 83 – were the most pivotal in the brain’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shifts are characterised by developments such as puberty, personality stabilisation, “reorganisation” and decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In detail, these are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4132402" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-BRAIN-PHASES-NOV26-2025-1764155777.png?quality=80" alt="INTERACTIVE - BRAIN PHASES - NOV26, 2025-1764155777" data-interactive="true" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Childhood – birth to nine years old&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this period, the grey and white matter of the brain rapidly grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to information from United States-based Johns Hopkins Medicine, while grey matter primarily processes and interprets information, white matter transmits that information to other parts of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the brain, grey matter refers to the darker, outer portion, while white matter describes the lighter, inner section underneath,” Johns Hopkins says. “In the spinal cord, this order is reversed: the white matter is on the outside, and the grey matter sits within.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors of the new study: “The first few years of life are marked by consolidation and competitive elimination of synapses [the junctions where neurons meet and communicate with each other] and rapid increases in grey and white matter volume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This age also aligns with the onset of puberty, which begins between eight and 13 years old for females and nine and 14 years old for males, marking the initiation of significant alterations in hormone expression and robust neurological changes,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also found that the shift to adolescence introduced an “increased risk” of mental health, cognitive and behavioural disorders due to changes in hormones and a “neurobiological shift”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adolescence – 9 to 32&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, it was accepted that adolescence begins with puberty and ends before the age of 20. However, the study found that while adolescence certainly begins with puberty, its ending point is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The transition to adulthood is influenced by cultural, historical and social factors, making it context-dependent rather than a purely biological shift,” the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that in Western countries (ie, the United Kingdom and United States of America), adolescent topological development extends to around 32 years old, before brain networks begin a new trajectory of topological development,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that by age 32 in Western countries, the brain experiences the “most directional changes and a large shift in trajectory” compared with other turning points in life, as this is when white matter integrity and volume in the brain are increasing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors did not suggest a reason for this being the case in Western countries, and did not elaborate on how adolescence continues in people in other regions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adulthood – 32 to 66&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that while brain development rapidly accelerates during the first two phases of life, in adulthood – the longest phase – there are no major turning points until the 60s, as the brain develops more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This period of network stability also corresponds with a plateau in intelligence and personality,” it found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early ageing – 66 to 83&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the brain does not show any abrupt signs of decline during this phase, shifts in the patterns of connection in the brain do occur due to a decrease in white matter integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain now works more independently in separate regions, coordinating less as a single whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early 60s mark an important shift in health and cognition, with the onset of dementia and elevated blood pressure for many, both of which can accelerate brain ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Late ageing – 83 onwards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is less data on this era of the brain’s progression than the other phases due to a low sample size, the study’s findings correlated with a declining trend in brain connectivity, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, this could reflect a true weakening relationship between age and structural brain topology in late life,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-this-significant"&gt;Why is this significant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research into the period of adolescence is the most significant finding from the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, adolescence ranges from 10 to 19 years of age. In 2018, a report in The Lancet medical journal found that adolescence ended in the 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at Cambridge University in England and one of the authors of the study, told The Independent newspaper that the new report helps us better understand the brain’s vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 11:33:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNR0lXWW94U29PM0pjcUllbVJLaTNjeTZYMlpFRXhKR0l2NVZPRzdGUVpNRUlESU0tRFMweXF6alpIVy1rSDZyODRCUndaYXJocmk0M2d2QmhyQkhYNjRmN0dHUlFqY3c3Z1VXalJ2a0ltWEtOMDJaOU1VT21oZ1JDbXBLTnV2Zkt6VG5Qbm9rSVRIekktUUZmaG5QS0g3cy1mc0VVa1R4ZUVFN0U</guid></item><item><title>青春期会持续到32岁吗？科学家解锁大脑的五个时代-半岛电视台</title><link>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/26/does-adolescence-last-until-32-scientists-unlock-brains-five-eras</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that adolescence can continue until the age of 32, as humans hit four major “turning points” in brain development at the ages of about nine, 32, 66 and 83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published on Tuesday in the journal, Nature Communications, the study examined nearly 4,000 scans of the brains of participants ranging in age up to 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers mapped out the brain’s development using this data and discovered that humans go through five “brain phases” – and within them, four significant life turning points as they grow, mature and decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, they discovered, it is not until age 32 that human personality and intelligence “plateau” and stabilise following changes in early adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-five-phases"&gt;What are the five phases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, brain development and ageing undergo five separate phases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="spaced-bullet-spacing"&gt;

In 2018, a report in The Lancet medical journal found that adolescence ended in the 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at Cambridge University in England and one of the authors of the study, told The Independent newspaper that the new report helps us better understand the brain’s vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 11:33:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNR0lXWW94U29PM0pjcUllbVJLaTNjeTZYMlpFRXhKR0l2NVZPRzdGUVpNRUlESU0tRFMweXF6alpIVy1rSDZyODRCUndaYXJocmk0M2d2QmhyQkhYNjRmN0dHUlFqY3c3Z1VXalJ2a0ltWEtOMDJaOU1VT21oZ1JDbXBLTnV2Zkt6VG5Qbm9rSVRIekktUUZmaG5QS0g3cy1mc0VVa1R4ZUVFN0XSAbABQVVfeXFMTU5GaFZmODZBSDR0TDNWNWV5S1FzdzVOQ3hDeWEwT3ZqMU5JeUp1M3dKc0llRHlCX2MzUXp3dVBzVjJ5YUZHcEVQSC1pT1ZVSXAzeVdkMXEzSGhGeVc0X1JJYXVFUUw4bnoycW9FNHdXS1RjLVR1RVpnREFvdzJMM2FIdElUM2xPT1Zrd0ZzMTNZeHU5MzlZOFBUVmdrRG9nLVZ5NlVqZEZrcno2c0w5ZFE</guid></item><item><title>“微生物组有点像森林” ：阴道中的细菌如何改善健康- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251125-how-bacteria-in-the-vagina-can-improve-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's also a good idea to follow a healthy diet.

			&lt;p&gt;A build-up of sticky proteins in the brain is a key hallmark of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, thought to be closely linked to the disease's progression. Now scientists have found a new way to clear these harmful clumps in the brains of mice and the eyes of fruit flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This potentially promising  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="182889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; treatment involves an oral dose of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"&gt;arginine&lt;/a&gt;, an amino acid already used as a medication for conditions including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-may-now-have-hypertension"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was made by a team from Kindai University and Japan's National Institute of Neuroscience, who focused on the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;amyloid-beta plaques&lt;/a&gt; seen in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the same results can be achieved in human brains, we may have another avenue for potentially tackling a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-new-compound-reverses-alzheimers-symptoms-in-rats"&gt;key molecular symptom&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's – in a safe and easily applied way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-now-know-why-alzheimers-erases-memories-of-our-loved-ones"&gt;We May Now Know Why Alzheimer's Erases Memories of Our Loved Ones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrates that arginine can suppress amyloid-beta aggregation both in vitro and in vivo," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Yoshitaka Nagai, from Kindai University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What makes this finding exciting is that arginine is already known to be clinically safe and inexpensive, making it a highly promising candidate for repositioning as a therapeutic option for Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182892" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182892" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/FlyModel.jpg" alt="Fly model diagram" class="wp-image-182892 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/FlyModel.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/FlyModel-600x477.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182892" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Arginine reduced amyloid-beta clumping (in green) in fruit fly models. (Fujii et al., &lt;em&gt;Neurochem. Int.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers bred male mice with Alzheimer's-like aggregations of amyloid-beta, then added arginine to the animals' drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arginine significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-new-compound-reverses-alzheimers-symptoms-in-rats"&gt;reduced the protein build-up&lt;/a&gt; in the animals' brains and alleviated some of the related toxic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice given arginine also showed reduced behavioral abnormalities during tests and had less active neuroinflammatory genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the treatment may not be just scrubbing away the protein plaques; it could be reversing some of the harm being done to the brain, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments in fruit flies and test tubes added to the evidence that arginine could possibly clear out amyloid-beta clumps and stop them from forming in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists already knew that arginine can act as a kind of chemical chaperone, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa115"&gt;preventing the abnormal misfolding&lt;/a&gt; and clumping of proteins, like those seen in Alzheimer's disease. Animal studies also show arginine can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0305318"&gt;cross the blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt;, which is key for treating brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given its excellent safety profile and low cost, arginine could be rapidly translated to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer's and potentially other related disorders," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nagai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get ahead of ourselves here, it's important to note that the researchers used a relatively high dose of arginine in their animal tests, and more work needs to be done to figure out a safe treatment dose for humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while mouse and fruit fly models are often good substitutes for human diseases, there's no guarantee that these findings are going to carry over. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/animal-testing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73085" data-postid="182889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;animal testing&lt;/a&gt; has produced encouraging results, and clinical trials can now be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;remains some uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; that clearing away amyloid-beta plaques can actually work as a way of treating Alzheimer's. These clumps are definitely &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-where-alzheimer-s-plaques-might-really-come-from"&gt;harmful to neurons&lt;/a&gt;, but it's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-test-accurately-predicts-alzheimers-years-ahead-of-first-symptoms"&gt;still unclear&lt;/a&gt; whether they're helping to drive Alzheimer's to begin with, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt;signs of other mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxic-tiny-rna-molecules-identified-as-culprit-in-alzheimers-neuron-death"&gt;at work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with those caveats though, it's another encouraging step forward in our understanding of how Alzheimer's works and how we might be able to tackle it – another promising treatment option to add &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-drugs-show-alzheimers-promise-in-mice"&gt;to an ever-growing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open up new possibilities for developing arginine-based strategies for neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding and aggregation," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nagai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2025.106082"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurochemistry International&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Taking a photo of a friend? You've probably got their face centered and focused. Driving down a highway? Eyes on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for millions of adults with age-related macular degeneration, that crucial, central field of sight is blurred beyond recognition. &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/promising-new-treatments-amd"&gt;Current treatments&lt;/a&gt; can only slow its progression or augment vision, but the blur will usually continue to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; of a treatment based on  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; transplants has found the procedure may be able to safely reverse the cumulative damage to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-fruit-could-reduce-chances-of-eye-disease-macular-degeneration"&gt;hard-working macula&lt;/a&gt; – that part of the retina &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration"&gt;responsible for all you see directly in front of you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gold-injections-in-the-eye-may-be-the-future-of-vision-preservation"&gt;Gold Injections in The Eye May Be The Future of Vision Preservation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the first time this particular stem cell treatment has been tested in humans, and as a phase 1/2a clinical trial, the main focus of the investigation was safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of the treatment compared with existing therapies won't be known until at least the end of phase 3, but the preliminary results were positive enough that trials are proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier testing in the lab showed the transplant process was safe enough to proceed with in-human trials: the transplanted  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; retained their retinal identity, and no tumours or toxicity were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening 18 potentially eligible patients, the researchers enrolled six volunteers aged 71 to 86 who had been diagnosed with dry age-related macular degeneration (&lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration"&gt;the most common type, making up around 80 percent of all macular degeneration cases&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the participants had worse vision in general, with visual acuity scores ranging from 20/200 to 20/800 (which means they could only see the first, biggest letter on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"&gt;Snellen chart&lt;/a&gt;, at best). The other three had scores between 20/70 and 20/200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the less common and more rapid 'wet' macular degeneration, the 'dry' form of the condition is a gradual loss of vision caused by tiny deposits of fats and proteins destroying the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"&gt;retinal pigment epithelial cells&lt;/a&gt; (RPEs) that support the eye's light-sensitive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183119" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642.jpg" alt="diagram of macular degeneration" class="wp-image-183119 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642-600x280.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183119" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram showing early stages of dry macular degeneration, caused by deposits of fats and proteins known as drusen beneath the RPE.

The cells were inserted under the retina of the superior temporal macula in the patients' most-impaired eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the trial showed the treatment is safe, with no sign of the immune problems or tumors that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-stem-cell-test-may-reduce-tumour-risk-14932"&gt;can sometimes arise&lt;/a&gt; in stem cell transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No adverse events were related to the stem cells themselves, though there were a few of the typical complications seen in this kind of eye surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, each patient experienced an improvement in vision in the eye that received the transplant that was not apparent in the other, suggesting the stem cells were doing exactly what scientists had hoped they would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year after the treatment, the three participants who had the worst vision were able to see an average of 21 more letters on an eye chart than they had at the start of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although we were pleased with the safety data, the exciting part was that their vision was also improving," &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/adult-stem-cells-show-therapeutic-promise-treating-vision-loss-macular-degeneration"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Rajesh Rao, a physician-scientist and ophthalmologist at Michigan Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised by the magnitude of vision gain in the most severely affected patients who received the adult stem cell-derived RPE transplants. This level of vision gain has not been seen in this group of patients with advanced dry AMD."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is continuing to monitor patients who received higher doses (150,000 and 250,000 cells). If those doses are also deemed safe, it will help determine whether Rao and team can scale up human testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2025.08.012"&gt;Cell Stem Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"The three new cases are all unvaccinated Wasatch County high school students."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department suspects that people inside the high school during its normal hours may have been exposed to the virus on Nov. 14, 17 and 18, and at a school play on Nov. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A letter with notification and guidance was sent to Wasatch High School families to inform them of the situation," a press release issued by the health department reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonelle Fitzgerald, the health department's director, said a wastewater test taken on Nov. 6 showed the presence of the virus within the community, "and with cases existing in other parts of the state, we weren't surprised to see cases here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent rise in cases in Wasatch County comes as the state's total number of cases hits triple digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Utah Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; data dashboard shows 102 measles infections across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southwest Utah Health District leads the state's infections with 74 measles cases, followed by Utah County, with nine cases, and Wasatch County's eight infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four people have been diagnosed with measles over the last three weeks, the dashboard reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a major holiday marks a time for gatherings among family and loved ones, health officials warn that measles is highly contagious and spreads easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms, which typically appear within one to three weeks after exposure, can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that starts on the face and spreads downward&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wasatch County Health Department said it advises anyone experiencing symptoms to call their health care provider immediately, especially those who are unvaccinated or who have been exposed to a known case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials encourage residents to get both doses of the MMR vaccine, as they say it is 97% effective in preventing the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

                Dr. Ralph Abraham spoke at a Trump re-election rally in Lake Charles, La., on Oct. 11, 2019. At the time, Abraham was a Republican congressman running for governor of Louisiana. He lost that race, but was named the state's first surgeon general in 2024.

   &lt;p&gt;The second-highest ranking official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be Dr. Ralph Abraham, the head of Louisiana's health department.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;He has questioned the safety of the COVID vaccine and forbidden his department from promoting vaccines to the public.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Abraham will join the agency as principal deputy director, according to an official for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who was not authorized to speak to the media about a personnel matter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A former Republican congressman and a physician with a practice in Richland Parish, &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/office-of-the-surgeon-general" target="_blank"&gt;Abraham&lt;/a&gt; has been a vocal supporter of Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html" target="_blank"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, and shares some of his views on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Abraham, 71, has called COVID vaccines "&lt;a href="https://x.com/la_surgeon/status/1966237494627983445" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt;." During a Sept. 2024 state legislative meeting, Abraham said he would support investigating the debunked link between &lt;a href="https://www.healthcarejournalbr.com/journal/november-december-2024" target="_blank"&gt;vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The position has been vacant since &lt;a href="https://farmington.edu/about/news/umf-proudly-announces-dr-nirav-dinesh-shah-former-principal-deputy-director-of-the-u-s-cdc-as-the-2025-umf-commencement-speaker/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nirav Shah&lt;/a&gt;, who served under the Biden administration, stepped down in February.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shah called Abraham's appointment "atrocious."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Kennedy. The CDC's current acting director is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5522036/cdc-rfk-hhs-monarez-jim-oneill-leadership" target="_blank"&gt;Jim O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;, who most recently worked as an investor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because neither Kennedy nor O'Neill is a doctor or scientist, Abraham's medical degree is useful to help further their views, Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"With the addition of Dr. Abraham, they now have a scientific gloss that they can put on their anti-vaccine theories," Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He gives Secretary Kennedy some scientific and medical cover for their odious and unscientific beliefs," he added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Abraham was named Louisiana's first Surgeon General in 2024, under Republican Governor &lt;a href="https://gov.louisiana.gov/page/meet-the-governor" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Landry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soon after, Abraham moved to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/20/nx-s1-5223440/louisiana-ban-public-health-promoting-covid-flu-mpox-vaccines-landry-rfk-jr-anti-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;ban the promotion of COVID, flu and mpox vaccines&lt;/a&gt; by the state health department. He then &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-02-17/louisiana-medical-organizations-criticize-states-ban-on-vaccine-promotion" target="_blank"&gt;banned all vaccine promotion and events&lt;/a&gt; by the health department in February, hours after Kennedy was confirmed as health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late 2024, cases of whooping cough in Louisiana began to climb, eventually growing to &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/232491" target="_blank"&gt;387 cases&lt;/a&gt;, the worst outbreak of whooping cough in the state in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Early in the outbreak, two infants died from the disease. Infants are not eligible for their first pertussis vaccine until they're &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;2 months old&lt;/a&gt;, but they can acquire immunity if their mother was immunized while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After the infant deaths, Abraham's health department &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5576494/louisiana-whooping-cough-pertussis-infant-deaths" target="_blank"&gt;waited three months&lt;/a&gt; before issuing an official alert to physicians and warning the public in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Dr. Abraham's record shows that when an emergency in public health materializes, his instinct is to sweep it under the rug," Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the event of the next pandemic, "that could mean the difference between controlling a major outbreak versus letting it fester and explode," he added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The principal deputy director is the second in command at the CDC, said &lt;a href="https://www.ncicp.org/staff-member/anne-schuchat-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Anne Schuchat&lt;/a&gt;, who worked there for 33 years, including as principal deputy director from 2015 to 2021. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most appointees are CDC employees who've worked at the agency for many years, and have experience in crisis management and emergency response to public health threats, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities can run from overseeing every aspect of CDC's work within the U.S., to coordinating emergency responses to outbreaks around the world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schuchat called Abraham's appointment "scary."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This appears to be one more step away from health and towards danger," Schuchat said. "We know that vaccinations are saving lives and protecting health and preventing outbreaks, and ideology should not outweigh the evidence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the Louisiana legislature, Abraham supported bills to &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/politics/2025-04-23/bill-banning-fluoride-in-louisianas-public-water-systems-clears-senate-committee" target="_blank"&gt;ban fluoride in public water systems&lt;/a&gt;, and to expand access to &lt;a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2025/04/30/louisiana-surgeon-general-recommends-ivermectin-as-covid-for-his-patients-and-backs-deregulation/83362570007/" target="_blank"&gt;ivermectin to treat COVID&lt;/a&gt;, despite &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/30/1089809588/ivermectin-covid-treatment-brazil-study" target="_blank"&gt;evidence that it is not effective against COVID&lt;/a&gt;. The fluoride bill failed, but the ivermectin bill passed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Picking Abraham for this position was an "irresponsible choice," said &lt;a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lawrence-o-gostin/" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence Gostin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Dr. Abraham has little trust in science and he is likely to further erode the credibility of the CDC," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;HHS has not said when Abraham will start his new role.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's partnership with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WWNO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Progress in cutting the global toll of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="183081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; remains painfully slow, but a new blood test has sparked unusual levels of hope. Researchers say it could one day make routine screening far more effective by catching cancers earlier, when treatment has the best chance of saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galleri blood test, developed by US firm Grail, is the latest entrant to attract worldwide attention, after early trial results were described as "exciting" by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://grail.com/press-releases/grail-pathfinder-2-results-show-galleri-multi-cancer-early-detection-blood-test-increased-cancer-detection-more-than-seven-fold-when-added-to-uspstf-a-and-b-recommended-screenings/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; claims the test, currently being trialled by the NHS, can detect signals from 50 cancers and correctly identify the disease in 62 per cent of people who receive a positive result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-7-warning-signs-of-brain-cancer-you-might-easily-miss"&gt;The 7 Warning Signs of Brain Cancer You Might Easily Miss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also appears to be highly accurate at ruling cancer out, with a reported 99.6 percent success rate among those who were disease-free. At first glance, these headline figures appear to represent a significant step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before we reach for the champagne, it's worth looking more closely at what these numbers really mean. Early promise does not always translate into real-world performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183094" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cancer_cell_illo_642.jpg" alt="cancer cells illustration" class="wp-image-183094 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cancer_cell_illo_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cancer_cell_illo_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183094" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;New cancer blood test aims to identify cancers of varying types.

Of the 216 participants who tested positive, 133 were later found to have cancer, giving the "positive predictive value" (PPV) of 62 percent that has been &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c205g21n1zzo"&gt;so&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/05/galleri-early-cancer-detection-blood-test/87009742007/"&gt;widely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/10/18/cancer-blood-test-seven-times-more-effective-than-current/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That metric answers a crucial question: "If I test positive, what's the chance I actually have cancer?" It also means, however, that 38 percent of positive results were false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specificity – how often a test avoids falsely diagnosing cancer – is equally important, given the anxiety and medical follow-up triggered by an incorrect result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the test performed well: 99.6 percent of people without cancer received a correct negative result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even this strong number has implications. If everyone aged over 50 in the UK were tested – more than 26 million people – the same rate would still generate over 100,000 false positives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has been less widely discussed is sensitivity, the measure of how many true cancer cases the test actually detects. On this measure, the result was 40.4 percent, meaning the test missed around three in every five cancers that appeared over the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galleri test results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A chart showing how many cancer cases the Galleri test would correctly identify." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=511&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=511&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=511&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=642&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=642&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=642&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Galleri cancer test in numbers.

It also raises the risk that patients could be falsely reassured by a negative result, potentially delaying a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statisticians caution that the reported PPV, specificity, and sensitivity are estimates rather than fixed values, and each comes with uncertainty. They also note that tests often perform less well outside carefully controlled trials, meaning real-world accuracy could be lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, where does this leave the Galleri test? It may well become a useful addition to future screening programmes, provided that negative results are not viewed as definitive by patients or doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the low sensitivity means many cancers would still be missed in its current form. The test is also expensive – US$949 (£723) in the US – and no evidence yet shows that widely using it reduces cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early data is encouraging, but perhaps the excitement deserves to be tempered. This technology may be a step forward, but it is not a solution on its own.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270438/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

It is familiar, versatile and woven into so many everyday meals, whether it is paneer in a curry, cheddar in a sandwich or mozzarella on a Friday night pizza. Most of us think about cheese in terms of flavour and convenience, not long term health. Yet researchers have begun looking at whether small dietary choices, such as how often you eat cheese, might relate to your future brain health. The idea sounds almost too simple, but sometimes lifestyle habits that seem insignificant can form quiet patterns over time. As conversations around dementia risk grow, even a food as ordinary as cheese has found its way into scientific discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major peer reviewed study titled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/21/3363" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cheese Consumption and Incidence of Dementia in Community Dwelling Older Japanese Adults: The JAGES 2019–2022 Cohort Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; followed more than 7,900 adults aged 65 and older for three years and found that weekly cheese consumption was linked with a lower incidence of dementia. This does not mean cheese prevents dementia, but the association is strong enough to merit attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Sleepless in middle age: A risky link to dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How your weekly cheese consumption may be linked to lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study compared adults who ate cheese at least once a week with those who did not eat cheese at all. Among weekly cheese eaters, around 3.4 per cent developed dementia during the follow-up period, compared with about 4.5 per cent in non-cheese eaters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After accounting for factors such as age, income, physical activity and existing health conditions, the cheese eating group still showed a hazard ratio of 0.76, which translates to roughly a 24 per cent relative reduction in dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absolute difference remains small, but when viewed at a population level, especially in countries where cheese is not regularly consumed, even small nutritional habits may add up. The study’s strength lies in its large sample size and careful adjustment of lifestyle factors, which helps rule out some of the common confounders that often appear in nutrition research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the research says about &lt;keyword id="31003993" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="cheese-consumption-and-dementia-risk" source="keywords"&gt;cheese consumption and dementia risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study did not prove a direct cause, it offered several theories for why cheese might be linked with better cognitive outcomes. Cheese contains high-quality proteins, essential fatty acids and vitamin K2, all of which support vascular and neurological health. Since the health of blood vessels is closely tied to cognitive function, foods that promote vascular wellbeing could indirectly influence dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory relates to the gut microbiome. Many cheeses, particularly fermented varieties, contain beneficial bacterial cultures and bioactive peptides that may support a healthier gut environment. Research over recent years has shown a strong connection between gut health and the ageing brain, although this particular study did not differentiate types of cheese. Still, the idea that fermented dairy foods can influence long-term cognitive outcomes has become an active area of scientific interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that people who eat cheese tend to have more diverse or nutrient-rich diets overall. The study found that non-cheese eaters often had generally poorer dietary patterns. Therefore, cheese consumption might act as a marker for a healthier eating style rather than being the single protective factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why cheese might support brain health according to emerging science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the nutrient profile, researchers believe cheese may align with dietary patterns that support better brain ageing. Diets rich in whole foods, moderate in healthy fats and balanced in protein are often associated with reduced dementia risk. When cheese is consumed in moderation, it can contribute to this balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese also provides satiety, which may indirectly improve diet quality by limiting excessive snacking or reducing reliance on highly processed foods. While this is not explicitly measured in the study, nutritional habits tend to work as a network of behaviours rather than isolated choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to understand the limits of the evidence. The study did not measure biomarkers or track the effects of different cheese varieties. Nor did it explore portion sizes, meaning the results apply only to frequency, not quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can your own diet take from the cheese and dementia risk findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings do not suggest that increasing cheese intake alone will meaningfully change your dementia risk. Instead, they highlight the value of a well-rounded diet where cheese can play a part. Eating cheese once or twice a week fits comfortably within most healthy eating patterns, especially when combined with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and omega-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy cheese already, the research offers a gentle reassurance that your weekly habit may align with positive long-term patterns. If you avoid dairy because of intolerance or preference, there is no need to add cheese solely for brain health. Plenty of foods such as leafy greens, berries, legumes and oily fish also support cognitive wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study means for long term brain health and everyday eating&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection between cheese consumption and dementia risk adds a thoughtful angle to our understanding of diet and ageing. It is an association, not a prescription, but it invites a broader discussion about the small consistent choices that support brain health across decades. Cheese can be part of this picture, but it remains just one element among sleep, exercise, social engagement, mental stimulation and overall diet quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything, the study reminds us that brain health is shaped by a mosaic of everyday habits. Your weekly cheese habit might be one of them, offering not a magic solution but a small, meaningful piece of the larger puzzle of healthy ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Of the 308 who benefited from tirzepatide, 254 (82 percent) regained at least 25 percent of the weight they had lost on the drug by week 88. Further, 177 (57 percent) regained at least 50 percent, and 74 (24 percent) regained at least 75 percent. Generally, the more weight people regained, the more their cardiovascular and metabolic health improvements reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data gaps and potential off-ramps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there were 54 participants of the 308 (17.5 percent) that didn’t regain a significant amount of weight (less than 25 percent.) This group saw some of their health metrics worsen on withdrawal of the drug, but not all— blood pressure increased a bit, but cholesterol didn’t go up significantly overall. About a dozen participants (4 percent of the 308) continued to lose weight after stopping the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers couldn’t figure out why these 54 participants fared so well; there were “no apparent differences” in demographic or clinical characteristics, they reported. It’s clear the topic requires further study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, overall, the study offers a gloomy outlook for patients hoping to avoid needing to take anti-obesity drugs for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oczypok and Anderson highlight that the study involved an abrupt withdrawal from the drug. In contrast, many patients may be interested in slowly weaning off the drugs, stepping down dosage levels over time. So far, data on this strategy and the protocols to pull it off have little data behind them. It also might not be an option for patients who abruptly lose access or insurance coverage of the drugs. Other strategies for weaning off the drugs could involve ramping up physical activity or calorie restriction in anticipation of dropping the drugs, the experts note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to more data on potential GLP-1 off-ramps, the pair calls for more data on the effects of weight fluctuations from people going on and off the treatment. At least one study has found that the regained weight after intentional weight loss may end up being proportionally higher in fat mass, which could be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Oczypok and Anderson say doctors should be cautious about talking with patients about these drugs and what the future could hold. “These results add to the body of evidence that clinicians and patients should approach starting [anti-obesity medications] as long-term therapies, just as they would medications for other chronic diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;An 11-year-old boy in England died in front of his mother and grandmother at home ... just hours after complaining to his doctor about a sore throat and being told it was nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

    &lt;section id="cb-0f4054c3d63bfff2af23fe3a902a563f" class="canvas-block canvas-block-permalink canvas-text-block canvas-text-block-permalink canvas-text-block--default  " data-context='{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}'&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frankie-Rae Law&lt;/strong&gt; went to see a doctor on Nov. 14 in England, but he was told his sore throat was "just a virus," and he was sent home and died ... according to the South West News Service.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The boy's mother, &lt;strong&gt;Keleigh Law&lt;/strong&gt;, says her son's condition got worse in a hurry later that night ... she says he was laughing and playing around like usual when all of a sudden, he started having trouble breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;a id="continued" class="continued-anchor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Keleigh says her son came to the living room, gasping for air, and his face expressed "absolute sheer horror." She says they went to the bathroom, and within moments, he was unconscious, slumped over the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;She says his lips were gray, and his eyes were glazed ... and his grandma performed CPR for 30 minutes, but he only opened his eyes for a couple of seconds and spat up some saliva before knocking out again.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Keleigh called paramedics, and her son was rushed to a hospital, where doctors put him on a ventilator and told her the chance of survival was "very thin." She says she was told he would have brain damage if he survived, and she ultimately pulled the plug.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Frankie-Rae's cause of death is unclear ... his mom says she has no clue what was wrong with him and feels like she "failed him."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

Abraham’s appointment was confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/25/cdc-new-deputy-vaccine-ralph-abraham/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;to the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; by an HHS spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Abraham’s appointment is certain to cause renewed anxiety among health experts as rifts deepen over US vaccine policy under the leadership of the health secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, who is reconstituting leadership at US federal health agencies in ways that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/cdc-director-susan-monarez-key-takeaways" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prioritize vaccine skepticism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d8a3fe59-44f3-4c13-909d-91902064b7dc" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"RFK Jr’s anti-vaccine fight and US fear for public health: key moments from ousted CDC director’s testimony","elementId":"d8a3fe59-44f3-4c13-909d-91902064b7dc","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/cdc-director-susan-monarez-key-takeaways"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As Louisiana’s surgeon general since 2024, Abraham drew criticism for directing state health agencies to stop promoting mass vaccination as a public health strategy, and for criticizing “blanket government mandates” for immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Earlier this year, Abraham wrote that “missteps” during the Covid-19 pandemic had caused a loss of trust in government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Government should admit the limitations of its role in people’s lives and pull back its tentacles from the practice of medicine,” &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/7478" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;, adding that “restoring this trust requires returning medical decisions to the doctor-patient relationship, where informed, personalized care is guided by compassion and expertise rather than blanket government mandates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Notably, after Abraham left a congressional seat he had held from 2015 to 2021, his elected successor was his chief of staff, Luke Letlow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Letlow, who received Abraham’s support while running for Congress, then died from Covid-19 in December 2020 – days before he was due to be sworn in – at a time when protective vaccines against the virus were not widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Letlow’s widow, Julia Letlow, was subsequently elected to her late husband’s seat, with constituents who live in an area with a history of generally low vaccination rates. In April 2021, Julia Letlow told CBS News: “I would’ve given anything – I would’ve given everything – for that shot to be available for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Looking back now, and for someone to turn it away, it’s heartbreaking to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC currently has no permanent director following the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-ousted" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ousting of Susan Monarez&lt;/a&gt; over the summer. The HHS deputy secretary, Jim O’Neill, is serving as acting CDC director, making Abraham effectively No 1 at the institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The agency, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, was rocked when a gunman &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/atlanta-cdc-shooting" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;opened fire&lt;/a&gt; there. One of the suspect’s neighbors &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/2025/08/active-shooter-reported-on-emory-university-campus/?postId-9997223" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/a&gt;: “He very deeply believed that vaccines hurt him and were hurting other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Abraham’s elevation adds to the vaccine skeptics working at the CDC under Kennedy, who has previously cut funding to vaccine research programs and purged pro-vaccine members from the CDC’s federal vaccine advisory board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Abraham’s position on vaccines has previously brought him into conflict with the Louisiana US senator Bill Cassidy, a pro-vaccination physician, when Abraham &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-vaccination-surgeon-general-8e2eecde047648e6fb62c4b44edd6566" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;canceled the state’s mass&lt;/a&gt; vaccination program. The state is now in the midst of its worst &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5576494/louisiana-whooping-cough-pertussis-infant-deaths" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;whooping cough outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nonetheless, on the same day that Abraham canceled Louisiana’s mass vaccination program, Cassidy &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/16/louisiana-vaccines-rfk-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;voted to confirm&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy as HHS secretary. And Kennedy has now appointed Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Asked by CNN last weekend if Kennedy’s vaccine positions could cause harm to Americans, the senator responded that “anything that undermines the understanding, the correct understanding, the absolute scientifically based understanding that vaccines are safe and that, if you don’t take them, you’re putting your child or yourself in greater danger, anything that undermines that message is a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNZi0zTlhMcXhOcXlLUTc0REU5bFVnWGo5MzZGZmQwYktEdm5rUm1wUnpYRUJWLXlYcUFPYWNvUTZwWXRBeHlDcE13VWJkTWlQT0F5WTdkWnFXU3c5azZkcUtnZGJ5TnNjaVBmUl9HUjZfVTZtZnRwUk9wRUFmYkpHRExVbXhvWTlC</guid></item><item><title>研究绘制了成人8种长COVID症状模式- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/study-maps-8-long-covid-symptom-patterns-adults</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A large, prospective US &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65239-4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; has identified eight distinct long-COVID trajectories, highlighting the diverse manifestations of the condition and laying the groundwork for future studies to evaluate risk factors and biomarkers that could explain variations in symptoms and identify therapeutic targets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study, led by a team at Massachusetts General Hospital, followed 3,659 participants (69% female) from the National Institutes of Health Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Adult Cohort. The National Institutes of Health established RECOVER to address COVID as a global health priority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers tracked participants from 3 to 15 months after their first COVID infection. Almost all participants (99.6%) were infected with the Omicron variant. The enrollment period spanned October 29, 2021, to June 27, 2023. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall, 10.3% of participants met the criteria for long COVID at three months, and 81% of them continued to report persistent or fluctuating symptoms more than a year later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings were published last week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;14% of participants experienced worsening symptoms over time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eight symptom trajectories emerged. About 5% of the infected cohort had “persistent, high” symptom burden across the entire 15-month period, while 12% experienced “intermittently high” symptoms. Another 10% showed moderate symptoms that gradually improved, and 9% experienced low-level symptoms that largely resolved by month six. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notably, 14% followed worsening or delayed-worsening trajectories, including a group whose symptoms remained minimal until spiking at month 15.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study compared infected participants with an uninfected cohort over the same period. While persistent and improving symptoms were less common among uninfected adults, some worsening patterns appeared in both groups, raising the possibility that not all symptom increases reflect long COVID.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The authors note several study limitations, including reliance on symptom surveys collected every three months (which may not have captured more granular, day-to-day changes), and the inability to capture trajectories beyond 15 months. Still, the large sample size, representative population, detailed symptom questionnaire, standardized long-COVID index, and minimal loss to follow up provide a clearer picture of long COVID’s different trajectories. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a Mass General Brigham (MGB) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/insights-into-long-covid-trajectories-in-adults"&gt;&lt;span&gt;press release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, corresponding author Bruce Levy, MD, of the MGB Department of Medicine, said, “Our findings will help determine what resources are needed for clinical and public health support of individuals with long COVID and will also inform efforts to understand long COVID’s biological basis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;Over the summer, a government website that helped Americans find vaccines got a MAHA makeover. Then it stopped working altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration removed language from &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="http://vaccines.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccines.gov&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that said “Vaccines can help you stay healthy” on June 24, according to a NOTUS analysis of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250624010930/https://www.vaccines.gov/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previous&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250624202844/https://www.vaccines.gov/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;versions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the site cached by &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="http://web.archive.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;web.archive.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It also cut the site’s FAQ section explaining “The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones is to get the vaccines recommended for you” and — most critically — changed the search tool that allowed users to enter their ZIP code to find vaccination sites in their area.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        

    
&lt;p&gt;Now, the ZIP code search doesn’t work. A site banner on the page states: “The functionality of this website may be impacted while it is being updated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.notus.org/health-science/robert-f-kennedy-changes-to-cdc-website-vaccine-language" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; linking vaccines to rising autism rates drew &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.notus.org/health-science/sen-bill-cassidy-cdc-anti-vaccine-language-change-rfk-jr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;widespread criticism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when they were made last week. But it appears that the agency has been quietly pulling back its online vaccination resources for much longer. The CDC did not give NOTUS a timeline for when Vaccines.gov would function again — nor did it answer repeated inquiries about the stated updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;As publicly stated on the website banner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the functionality of this website may be impacted while it is being updated,” a CDC spokesperson told NOTUS via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes to Vaccines.gov were made at a tumultuous moment for the CDC and U.S. vaccine policy. One day after the Trump administration removed information from the site, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — made up of a cadre of vaccine skeptics &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.notus.org/health-science/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-recommendation-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hand-selected&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by Health Secretary Robert F.

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines.gov was originally launched by the Biden administration in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/30/fact-sheet-biden-administration-launches-covid-gov-a-new-one-stop-shop-website-for-vaccines-tests-treatments-masks-and-the-latest-covid-19-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2021&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.usds.gov/projects/vaccines-dot-gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;grew&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; out of a collaboration between the CDC and researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital, who had previously collaborated to develop the vaccination search engine &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="http://vaccinefinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;VaccineFinder.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. That site remains active, but it’s unclear if its team is still receiving government funds. The website &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119044644/https://www.vaccinefinder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no longer sports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the CDC’s logo.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        

    
&lt;p&gt;John Brownstein, whose team at Boston Children’s ran Vaccinefinder.org, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/business/vaccine-finder-org.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the New York Times in 2021 that the project received around $1 million per year from the federal government to maintain the site, first from HHS, then from CDC directly beginning in 2017. He said at the time that they also received over $8 million to expand to include COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent record of government funding for Vaccines.gov NOTUS was able to locate was a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/2997179c770f471aa9903b4bf49ca396/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 grant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Vaccinefinder.org told NOTUS via email that their organization ran Vaccines.gov until their funding contract ended in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are not aware of who at CDC maintains the website now,” the spokesperson said. They did not immediately respond to questions about whether the contract was canceled or not renewed. Brownstein and Boston Children’s Hospital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One former CDC official who requested anonymity to speak candidly said Vaccines.gov was formerly under the jurisdiction of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, but currently, “decisions are being made by CDC leadership/HHS leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it’s down, it would be because IRD was directed to take it down,” the official said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        

    
&lt;p&gt;Former NCIRD director Demetre Daskalakis confirmed that Vaccines.gov was a “CDC asset” that HHS “took over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have heard that they are planning to ‘update it’ and shudder to think what that will mean,” Daskalakis told NOTUS via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal, state and local health organizations have continued to refer to Vaccines.gov as a resource for people searching for vaccines — despite the fact that the website is a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can locate a vaccine site at &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.vaccines.gov/search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://www.vaccines.gov/search/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” the Department of Veterans Affairs website says on a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.va.gov/long-beach-health-care/programs/seasonal-vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that was updated this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Visit Vaccines.gov to: Find vaccination locations near you from your health department or pharmacies,” says a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.usa.gov/covid-tests-vaccinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;page on USA.gov&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that was updated last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even HHS still &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/get-vaccinated/where/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;advertises&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; its own broken website on a page about where to get vaccinated against COVID-19, along with a texting service and number to call to find vaccination sites, both of which also appear to no longer be active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has already made changes to other Biden-era health websites, including &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="http://covid.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Covid.gov&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="http://covidtests.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Covidtests.gov&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which used to host information about treatment, testing and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now they are about the controversial theory that the COVID-19 pandemic started in a Chinese lab.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TWIN FALLS, Idaho — The South Central Public Health District in Idaho has reported a "steep increase" in HIV and HIV-3, commonly known as AIDS, in several Idaho counties. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Central Public &lt;a href="/article/news/local/maternity-desert-oregon-county-fights-to-restore-labor-and-delivery-care-with-federal-funding/277-9b41be07-e924-4276-93b8-49bf91643258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; District (SCPHD) oversees eight counties in Idaho, including Blaine, Camas, Cassia, Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, Minidoka, and Twin Falls. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those eight counties, new cases of HIV and HIV-3 in 2025 have "far outpaced total case numbers from 2024," a news release announced. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to numbers provided by SCPHD, there were five cases of HIV reported last year. However, in 2025, there were 15 cases reported. For HIV-3 cases, or AIDS cases, there was only one reported case in 2024. There have been nine reported cases this year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCPHD is now urging residents of these counties, and all Idahoans, to practice vigilance. SCPHD asks that residents reduce their risk of contracting HIV by using condoms and obtaining up-to-date HIV and STI testing following sexual acts with a new partner. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“HIV is now a manageable condition with proper treatment; however, cases that are undiagnosed or go untreated remain a serious concern," SCPHD Epidemiologist Jacob Ward said in a news release. "When HIV is not treated, it can progress to AIDS. This severely weakens the immune system and increases the risk of life-threatening infections and illnesses. Early testing and consistent treatment are so important to protecting long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World AIDS Day is set to be held on Monday, Dec. 1. To honor the day, SCPHD will be offering free HIV screenings all day on selected dates at its Twin Falls and Jerome locations. SCPHD is doing so to support community health and early detection, a news release said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk-in testing at the SCPHD Twin Falls office is scheduled for Thursday, Dec. 4. At the Jerome office, walk-in testing is available on Tuesday, Dec. 9, between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Valerie's yummy 4-ingredient anti-inflammatory dessert is chia pudding. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She uses a flavored protein shake as her liquid, plus blackberries and gut-healthy yogurt on top. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds have omega-3 fatty acids that may help lower inflammation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If there's anyone we trust to give us a classic recipe that they've been enjoying for years, it's Valerie Bertinelli.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bertinelli shared an easy dessert that only takes four ingredients to make. It's customizable, tasty and may even help reduce inflammation. Here's what she had to say about her go-to cold dessert.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I made chia pudding for my treat for the day," Bertinelli said. "And it's really easy: you take 2 tablespoons of chia seeds and a half a cup of liquid."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; have plant-based omega-3 fatty acids, fiber and protein. They can help reduce inflammation, lower cholesterol and can help promote weight loss, if that is your goal. Chia pudding is a great way to incorporate the healthy seeds into your diet in a delicious way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, the liquid that Bertinelli added was Core Power's Strawberry Banana High-Protein Shake. We named Core Power as one of our favorite protein shakes on the market in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7964007/best-protein-shakes-protein-powders/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EatingWell's&lt;/em&gt; protein shake taste test&lt;/a&gt;, so we definitely approve of this option!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I stirred it up, put it in the fridge, let it sit for about four hours," Bertinelli explained. "Overnight's better, but I forgot to make it last night. And then I put a little bit of vanilla yogurt on top and some fresh blackberries."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-valerie-fights-inflammation-with-dessert"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Valerie Fights Inflammation with Dessert &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Topping off the pudding with blackberries and yogurt adds an extra &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory punch&lt;/a&gt; to this recipe. Adding these foods into your eating pattern can contribute to reducing inflammation, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7669105/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;combat symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like joint stiffness, mental fog and digestive issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That's all it takes! Just four ingredients for a fruity and satisfying bite. Bertinelli's recipe is very similar to our own &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia pudding formula&lt;/a&gt; that we absolutely swear by. It's completely customizable and so easy to make ahead of time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's so nutritious that you could actually eat it for breakfast and be fueled to take on the rest of the morning.

&lt;/p&gt;

As second in command, Abraham would be in a position to act as a key adviser on a variety of public health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8e988" class="body-graf"&gt;A three-term Louisiana congressman, Abraham practiced for 10 years as a veterinarian before going to medical school. According to his &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/docs/Secretary/OfficialDocs/Official-Bio_Ralph-Abraham.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;biography on the Louisiana Department of Health website&lt;/a&gt;, Abraham was a “practicing family medicine physician” when he was appointed as state surgeon general in 2024. He described himself as a “&lt;a href="https://pro.stateaffairs.com/la/health-care/ralph-abraham-maha-robert-kennedy-jeff-landry" target="_blank"&gt;country doctor&lt;/a&gt;” in an essay published in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82eac5" class="body-graf"&gt;While Abraham is licensed to practice medicine in Louisiana, the &lt;a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/02/18/abraham-board/" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana Illustrator reported&lt;/a&gt; in February that he did not appear to be board-certified in the specialty of family medicine. A search for Abraham on the &lt;a href="https://portfolio.theabfm.org/diplomate/find.aspx?ts=638996677" target="_blank"&gt;American Board of Family Medicine’s website&lt;/a&gt; yielded no results. A separate search on the &lt;a href="https://online.lasbme.org/#/verifylicense" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiner’s site&lt;/a&gt; lists Abraham as a general practitioner but not a family medicine doctor. (Board certification isn’t required to practice any particular specialty, but it’s viewed as an extra layer to ensure a doctor’s credentials, experience and expertise, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.abpsus.org/physician-board-certified-specialties/" target="_blank"&gt;American Board of Physician Specialties&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-597546" class="body-graf"&gt;Abraham’s new position makes him the most senior scientist at CDC. The current acting director, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/separate-measles-mumps-rubella-vaccine-acting-cdc-director-rcna235971" target="_blank"&gt;Jim O’Neill, is not a medical doctor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c2a62" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Richard Besser, who served as an acting director of the CDC in 2009 under the Obama administration, said he is “greatly concerned” that Abraham’s appointment will serve as an extension of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s well-established distrust of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-12c622" class="body-graf"&gt;“Dr. Abraham, rather than being someone who will push back on that, I think, will further the Secretary’s agenda,” said Besser, a pediatrician and president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said. “I would expect that Dr. Abraham will have a lot of authority over what takes place within the agency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8e3d8" class="body-graf"&gt;Abraham has been vocal in his opposition of Covid vaccines. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/louisiana-surgeon-general-says-covid-160350442.html" target="_blank"&gt;he told the Shreveport Times&lt;/a&gt; that he “sees Covid vaccine injuries every day.” There was no explanation of the kind of injuries he was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e105c" class="body-graf"&gt;In February, The &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-vaccination-surgeon-general-8e2eecde047648e6fb62c4b44edd6566" target="_blank"&gt;Associated Press reported&lt;/a&gt; that Abraham directed the Louisiana Department of Health, in an internal memo, to “no longer promote mass vaccination” through media campaigns like those for flu shots typically seen at the beginning of the winter respiratory virus season. The AP obtained the memo signed by Abraham. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a54cd1" class="body-graf"&gt;Abraham’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b3f3c" class="body-graf"&gt;While flu activity is low so far this season, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-46.html" target="_blank"&gt; CDC’s latest flu report&lt;/a&gt;, Louisiana is reporting the highest levels of flu-like illnesses in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c076ad" class="body-graf"&gt;In the past year, with Abraham at the helm, the state’s Department of Health waited several months after two babies died of whooping cough before&lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-CP/HANs/2025/HAN-25_2-Statewide-Increase-in-Pertussis-Cases.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; formally alerting the public&lt;/a&gt; about a rise in cases across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1def2b" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/la_surgeon/status/1990813242055114835" target="_blank"&gt;On X&lt;/a&gt;, Abraham &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-acetaminophen-fda-pregnancy-autism-cause-rcna232909" target="_blank"&gt;touted a drug called leucovorin&lt;/a&gt; as a promising treatment for some children with autism.

It's a common concern, so we consulted an expert to find out how you can enjoy your favorite drinks while keeping your pearly whites nice and bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;According to Dr. Anjali Rajpal, a board-certified dentist at &lt;a data-id="21ff9cfb-d62d-42d2-a2e2-f0acc1ba011e" href="https://bhdentalarts.com/" target="_self"&gt;Beverly Hills Dental Arts&lt;/a&gt;, there are different techniques you can use to prevent teeth staining while still getting to enjoy your favorite beverage. Plus, if your teeth have already been stained, Rajpal offers advice on how to brighten your pearly whites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="e73c270c-bc57-4195-b0c6-3678087461b1" data-ng-block="{"&gt;Why do coffee and wine stain your teeth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is a combination of chromogens (a substance that can be colorless but can be converted into a colored compound, often through a chemical reaction), tannins and acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Coffee and red wine stain teeth because they contain dark pigments called chromogens that stick to enamel. Tannins in these drinks help the pigments bind more strongly to the teeth. Their acidity also weakens enamel, making it easier for stains to set in," Rajpal told CNET. She explains that darker roasts and concentrated coffees, such as espresso, tend to stain teeth more than lighter brews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, red wine stains more than white, especially darker, tannin-rich varieties like cabernet sauvignon and malbec. "The longer these drinks stay in contact with your teeth, the more likely they are to cause staining," Rajpal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="d0ab6dfb-7584-4bb3-b456-3635e0baa530" data-ng-block="{"&gt;Do certain types of coffee or wine stain your teeth more than others?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that, yes, some &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/home/kitchen-and-household/this-coffee-expert-tested-40-k-cups-here-are-the-5-id-put-in-my-keurig/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;types of coffee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and wine can stain your teeth more. "Darker roasts and concentrated coffee like espresso tend to stain teeth more than lighter brews. Red wine stains more than white, especially darker, tannin-rich varieties like cabernet sauvignon and malbec," Rajpal explains. She also mentions that the longer these drinks stay in contact with your teeth, the more likely they are to cause staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of coffee and wine isn't the only thing you should consider when trying to keep your teeth white. The temperature of a drink can influence how much it can stain your teeth. Hot beverages are more likely to cause stains than iced ones. "Heat can slightly expand enamel, making it more porous and allowing pigments to penetrate more easily," Rajpal said. "While iced drinks may have less impact due to quicker consumption and lower enamel exposure, the type and frequency of the drink matter more overall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain types of coffee can stain your teeth more than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Boy_Anupong/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9a262815-f7ba-4301-bedc-74aac512a505" data-ng-block="{"&gt;Expert dental tips to keep your teeth white without giving up your favorite drinks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting your teeth from stains doesn't mean you have to give up your morning cup of Joe.

Sip your drink through a straw&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Straws help the liquid bypass your front teeth, minimizing the contact that leads to visible staining.

Drink your coffee or wine in one sitting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the worst things you can do is sip your coffee or wine slowly for hours. "Sipping slowly throughout the day constantly exposes your enamel to staining compounds and gives your teeth less time to recover, making stains more likely to build up over time," Rajpal says. Try to enjoy your drink over a 15- to 30-minute period, then rinse with water after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="2ebdcf23-1095-4ec0-b2f8-cc6bf37bb025" data-ng-block="{"&gt;3. Rinse, don't brush, right after&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this one seems counterintuitive, but brushing your teeth right after you have coffee or wine can actually do more harm. "Avoid brushing immediately after drinking, as acids can soften enamel and make it more vulnerable," Rajpal recommends. "Wait at least 30 minutes before brushing to protect softened enamel, and give a break between snacking or eating to boost natural cleansing by saliva."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="8a374af1-4de1-4ce9-9443-d8642596648e" data-ng-block="{"&gt;4. Pair your drink with enamel-friendly foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain foods can help neutralize acid and reduce the length of time pigments stay on teeth. Rajpal recommends crunchy foods like apples, carrots and celery, which gently scrub teeth and boost saliva, which helps wash away pigments. Cheese and leafy greens create a protective layer on enamel, while strawberries contain natural acids that can mildly brighten teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are foods you can eat to give your smile a boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;kiboka/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="bb968052-2165-404b-8525-00333a97470b" data-ng-block="{"&gt;5.

Unlike conventional treatments, which target cancer after it develops, the vaccine aims to train the immune system to recognise early abnormal lung cells and eliminate them before they form tumours. By intervening at the earliest stages, researchers hope LungVax could significantly reduce the incidence of lung cancer and improve survival rates. This historic trial has the potential to transform approaches to one of the world’s deadliest cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding early lung cancer and the LungVax phase I trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer remains one of the most lethal forms of cancer, with survival rates stubbornly low despite decades of research. In the UK alone, around 48,500 people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, and approximately 72% of these cases are linked to smoking, the largest preventable cause of cancer globally. Researchers have now pinpointed the biological mechanisms behind the early formation of lung cancer in smokers, identifying abnormal proteins called neoantigens and tumour-associated antigens that appear on the surface of lung cells at the earliest stages of cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding these early cellular changes, scientists are now able to develop vaccines that teach the immune system to recognise and attack abnormal cells before they progress into malignant tumours. The LungVax clinical trial has been awarded up to £2.06 million in funding from Cancer Research UK, with additional support from the CRIS Cancer Foundation. This funding will support a four-year Phase I trial, designed to establish both the safety and the optimal dosing of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase I trials are primarily concerned with safety, side effects, and identifying the appropriate dosage. In this trial, researchers will carefully monitor how participants respond to LungVax, documenting any adverse effects and observing the immune system’s response to the vaccine. Subject to regulatory approvals, the trial is expected to begin in summer 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How LungVax works&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike conventional cancer therapies, which often target tumours after they have developed, LungVax is a preventative vaccine. Lung cancer cells differ from healthy cells in that they display unique ‘red flag’ proteins on their surface, produced by mutations in the cell’s DNA. These proteins are called neoantigens and tumour-associated antigens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LungVax vaccine contains genetic instructions that teach the immune system to recognise these abnormal proteins. Once trained, the immune system can identify and destroy early-stage cancer cells before they form full tumours. The vaccine builds on mRNA technology first refined during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling safe and effective delivery of these instructions to the body’s immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Sarah Blagden, co-founder of LungVax from the University of Oxford, explains that this is a unique opportunity to actively prevent lung cancer. “Years of research into the biology of cancer, understanding the earliest cellular changes, will now be put to the test. Our hope is that LungVax will allow people to receive preventative protection against this lethal disease,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Target groups for the initial trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phase I trial will initially focus on two groups of participants:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer who have had the tumour surgically removed but remain at risk of recurrence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People undergoing routine lung cancer screening under the NHS Lung Cancer Screening Programme in England, who may be at high risk of developing the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the trial demonstrates safety and promising immune responses, the vaccine could progress to larger clinical trials, ultimately reaching a wider population at risk of lung cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While smoking cessation remains the most effective strategy to reduce lung cancer risk, vaccines like LungVax offer a complementary approach. By targeting cancer at its earliest stage, these interventions could significantly improve survival rates and reduce the burden of lung cancer worldwide. With the launch of this historic trial, the medical community is taking its first step towards a future in which lung cancer prevention is not just a possibility but a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 18:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>大脑中的细菌碎片会影响您的睡眠吗？这就是《科学》。- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/could-pieces-of-bacteria-in-your-brain-affect-your-sleep-heres-the-science</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Sleep is one of the essential physiological needs for human survival, alongside food, water, and air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sleep is socially driven, influenced by environmental and personal factors, and a recent study suggests it may be affected by fragments from bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, scientists have thought it unlikely that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/gut-microbes-23988"&gt;gut microbes&lt;/a&gt; affect physiological sleep regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1608302/full"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, indicated bacterial cell wall components (peptidoglycan) have been found in areas of the brain called the brainstem, olfactory bulb, and hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fragments-of-bacteria-in-our-gut-may-lull-our-brains-to-sleep-at-night"&gt;Fragments of Bacteria in Our Gut May Lull Our Brains to Sleep at Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peptidoglycan, also known as murein in scientific lore, is a strong, mesh-like layer outside the plasma membrane of most bacterial cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps contain the bacteria's shape and rigidity. Without peptidoglycan, bacteria would just be little water balloons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182944" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182944" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/bacterial_cell_sleeping_642.jpg" alt="bacterial cells" class="wp-image-182944 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/bacterial_cell_sleeping_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/bacterial_cell_sleeping_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182944" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bacterial walls are rigid, made of a material called peptidoglycan. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAG04vPHQko/"&gt;TrueCreatives/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent study suggested that the concentration of peptidoglycan seems to increase in periods of sleep deprivation or changes in sleeping patterns. This is a sign that the gut microbiota might play a role in sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was carried out on nine male mice which were housed in a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Measurements were taken over 48 hours to map brain activity cycles during sleep and rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards the mice were euthanised. Different areas of the brain were separated immediately so isolated areas could be measured independently for peptidoglycan levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been conducted and designed in a rigorous fashion. But the study exclusively used adult male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although animal models can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4283646/"&gt;translated to humans&lt;/a&gt;, the crossover in microbiota research is weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal research into microbiota can only tell us so much about what is happening in our guts because the environment in which humans and mice live is vastly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17183312/"&gt;breakthrough paper in 2006&lt;/a&gt; raised mice without any microorganisms in their bodies, known as germ-free mice, and then transplanted some of them with the gut microbiota from obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found the mice who had the gut microbiota transplant gained more body fat than germ-free mice colonised with microbiota from lean mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough research suggested that the gut microbiota might contribute to weight gain and a knock-on effect obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But follow-up studies using &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774355#247496527"&gt;fecal microbiota transplantation&lt;/a&gt; from lean humans into obese adolescents did not lead to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings in mice can suggest mechanisms but not necessarily predict outcomes in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the recent sleep research on mice has ignored the other 49% of the population, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10731147/"&gt;females&lt;/a&gt;. It's a gap that risks leaving half the world in the dark about sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to understanding the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-00974-4"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;, does it really matter what organisms are found in the gastrointestinal tract of rodents and how this might interfere with their sleep patterns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-of-over-400000-people-links-gut-bacteria-with-insomnia-risk"&gt;Study of Over 400,000 People Links Gut Bacteria With Insomnia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brain is traditionally considered sterile and protected by the blood-brain barrier. This tight system blocks microbes and molecules from entering the brain in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence to suggest that there is a brain microbiome, unlike within the digestive system and on our skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, previous studies have shown &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/8/4235"&gt;fragments&lt;/a&gt; that relate to bacteria, such as peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides, can be detected within the brain. This is probably because the fragments are smaller than bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier and intestinal wall are more permeable in conditions like sleep deprivation, inflammation, ageing or even after strenuous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182950" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_brain_barrier_sleeping_642.jpg" alt="brain model" class="wp-image-182950 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_brain_barrier_sleeping_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_brain_barrier_sleeping_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182950" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood vessels in the brain are surrounded by a barrier that prevents microbes from entering.

    &lt;p&gt;Celebrity chefs &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/jamie-oliver-6971"&gt;Jamie Oliver&lt;/a&gt;, Hugh Fearnley‑Whittingstall and Tom Kerridge have backed a new campaign that is putting the spotlight on beans. The &lt;a href="https://foodfoundation.org.uk/sites/default/files/2025-09/Bean%20project%20overview_2025.pdf"&gt;Bang In Some Beans&lt;/a&gt; campaign is a bid to double the UK’s intake of beans, legumes and pulses by 2028.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a campaign is long overdue. Despite beans on toast being a British favourite, beans, pulses and legumes remain under-consumed in the UK. According to data from &lt;a href="https://foodfoundation.org.uk/sites/default/files/2025-10/TFF_Beans%20Facts_DIGITAL.pdf"&gt;the Food Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, two-thirds of the UK population eat less than one portion of beans a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beans are one of the most affordable and nutritious foods out there. With food costs continuing to rise and poor nutrition contributing to a growing number of diseases, beans may offer a solution to both problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging greater bean consumption could also help close the UK’s fibre gap, as most of the UK population &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey-2019-to-2023/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey-2019-to-2023-report"&gt;do not meet&lt;/a&gt; the recommended 30g of fibre per day. Beans are one of the simplest, most achievable ways to bridge that gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still aren’t convinced, here are just a few of the health benefits beans can provide: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. They can help you manage your weight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beans are a great source of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2011.596639"&gt;protein, fibre and micronutrients&lt;/a&gt; such as iron, magnesium and potassium. Increasing bean intake could improve your health and reduce &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2011.596639"&gt;chronic disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020519"&gt;Research also shows&lt;/a&gt; that people who consume higher amounts of beans have lower body weight, smaller waist circumference and lower blood pressure. These are all associated with reduced risk of multiple chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119776802.ch19"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are beans low in calories, their high fibre and protein content can help increase satiety (the feeling of fullness), which is a key factor in appetite regulation and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12937-024-00937-1"&gt;long-term weight management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. They’re good for your heart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An abundance of research links eating beans to a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020519"&gt;healthy heart&lt;/a&gt;. Diets rich in beans can significantly lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, improve blood pressure and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/C0FO00080A"&gt;fibre&lt;/a&gt; in beans binds cholesterol in the gut so it can be excreted from the body. Their potassium and magnesium content supports vascular function, which is essential for a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmz003"&gt;healthy heart&lt;/a&gt;. This is why, for those managing cardiovascular diseases or hyperlipidaemia, beans should be a cornerstone of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpt155"&gt;heart healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. They’re good for blood sugar levels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beans have a low glycaemic index. This means they release energy slowly, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.1044427"&gt;reduces blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;. Their fibre and protein content also helps slow carbohydrate absorption, which promotes better blood sugar control. Both factors are important for &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/2013.jamainternmed.70"&gt;preventing or managing type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2020.1762162"&gt;Evidence from clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; shows incorporating beans into meals also benefits other aspects of blood sugar in people with, or at risk of, type 2 diabetes – such as improving fasting blood sugar and insulin levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2014.228"&gt;randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; of over 100 people with type 2 diabetes found that those who consumed at least one cup of legumes daily for three months not only had better blood sugar control, they also had a significant decrease in body weight, waist circumference, cholesterol levels and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. They can benefit gut health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13113701"&gt;Beans support gut health&lt;/a&gt; by providing both soluble and insoluble fibre. These act as prebiotics, feeding &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3920/BM2020.0028"&gt;beneficial gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fermentation of these fibres in the gut also produces short-chain fatty acids, prebiotics which have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.117.156265"&gt;anti-inflammatory effects&lt;/a&gt; and support the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu5041417"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt;. Regular consumption contributes to improved digestion and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cofs.2017.01.005"&gt;bowel regularity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/young-female-shopper-chooses-beans-jar-2541740017"&gt;BearFotos/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Boosting your bean consumption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to make any sorts of dramatic dietary changes in order to incorporate more beans in your diet. Here are a few simple ways to eat more beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Start gradually.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begin with small portions (about half a cup of cooked beans) a few times a week, increasing this as your digestive system adjusts and to avoid &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15194121"&gt;flatulance and bloating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Mix up varieties.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rotate between beans such as chickpeas, kidney beans, lentils, black beans and cannellini beans. Diversity &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/app142210215"&gt;boosts nutrient variety&lt;/a&gt; and keeps meals interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Add beans to familiar dishes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stir beans or other legumes into soups, stews, curries, salads or pasta sauces. Even a handful can make a meaningful difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Choose canned beans.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just as nutritious as dried or fresh beans – just ensure you rinse them well to reduce the sodium content. If you do use dried beans, ensure you soak them overnight and cook them thoroughly to neutralise anti-nutrients such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102929"&gt;phytates&lt;/a&gt; (which can reduce absorption of other nutrients) and improve their digestibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutritionally speaking, chickpeas and lentils are good choices, as they’re high in fibre and protein. Black beans &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.124"&gt;contain antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; – compounds which have been linked to lower risk of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.3217"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the best beans are the ones you can integrate into your diet and will eat regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are some groups of people who should be mindful when increasing their bean intake, as some of the compounds they contain can have a negative impact on health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs-140564"&gt;IBS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/ibd-18679"&gt;IBD&lt;/a&gt; or digestive sensitivities may struggle with bloating or gastric discomfort if they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjae190.1144"&gt;consume large amounts of beans&lt;/a&gt;. Beans should be introduced into the diet gradually based on how well your body tolerates them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with kidney disease may want to be careful due to the &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/kidney360/fulltext/2020/01000/potassium_homeostasis,_chronic_kidney_disease,_and.14.aspx"&gt;high potassium content in beans&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, it’s important to consult with a doctor before consuming diets rich in beans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who suffer from low iron or zinc levels may also want to be careful with how they prepare beans. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.992169"&gt;anti-nutrient compounds&lt;/a&gt; in beans can disrupt the absorption of minerals, which is why it’s so important to soak beans and cook them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beans are a nutritional powerhouse. High in fibre, protein and key micronutrients, they support heart, metabolic and gut health while being both affordable and environmentally friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

This is likely due to the complexity of the risk-based criteria and stigma associated with smoking and lung cancer, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Health Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here For More Health Stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To test an alternative, the researchers modeled a different approach: screening everyone between the ages of 40 and 85, regardless of smoking history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Under that universal, age-based model, about 94% of the cancers in their cohort would have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal screening procedures could save lives and hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Such a change could prevent roughly 26,000 U.S. deaths each year, at a cost of about $101,000 per life saved, according to their estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study emphasized that this would be far more cost-effective than current screening programs for breast or &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/colorectal-cancer-diagnoses-soar-among-younger-adults-one-key-reason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colorectal cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, which cost between $890,000 and $920,000 per life saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Herrera noted the many challenges in the adoption of lung cancer screening, from lack of awareness to some providers not recommending the screening test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, he added, "The cost of screening is covered by most health insurance plans and many institutions also offer discounts for patients who don’t have insurance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lung cancer remains the deadliest cancer in the country, killing more people each year than colon, prostate and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/breast-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:breast cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; combined. But because of the narrow eligibility criteria based on smoking history, millions at risk never get screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Northwestern Medicine researchers argue that expanding screening to include all adults within an age range could help close those gaps, especially for groups often underdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers argue that expanding screening to include all adults could help catch the missing cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study was conducted at a single academic center, which means the patient population may not represent the wider U.S. population.

            National Geographic fellow and best-selling author Dan Buettner knows this as well as anyone, and he has tips you can use — even for holiday feasts﻿. For two decades, he has been studying “blue zones,” places around the globe where people live the longest and healthiest lives. Diet is one of the major reasons why these folks have an edge.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000k3b6ndfkbk13z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/29/health/longevity-blue-zone-meals-wellness"&gt;People in blue zones&lt;/a&gt;, including Okinawa, Japan, and the island of Sardinia in Italy, eat plant-based diets that prioritize whole foods. “These simple peasant foods taste maniacally delicious,” Buettner told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life. “That’s the word I like to use.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000l3b6nxca2vat1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Buettner’s latest cookbook, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Zones-Kitchen-One-Meals/dp/1426224125/" target="_blank"&gt;The Blue Zones Kitchen One Pot Meals&lt;/a&gt;: 100 Recipes to Live to 100,” puts a spin on the healthy ingredients people use in these far-flung places so that they&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;appeal to the American palate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000m3b6nlvxol83p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Buettner collaborated with &lt;a href="https://jeichstaedt.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Eichstaedt&lt;/a&gt;, who directs Stanford University’s Computational Psychology and Well-Being Lab, using artificial intelligence to analyze 675,000 recipes from popular websites including Food Network and Allrecipes.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“We found that most of the most popular recipes in America followed one of seven different patterns,” Buettner explained. “And then we kind of reverse engineered deliciousness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000o3b6np4fm3ak3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the recipes have other virtues to overcome common concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000p3b6npx22i4bs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you have the competition from fast food and processed food, one of the biggest objections you’re going to get is, ‘I don’t have time. No. 2, ‘I can’t afford it.’ No. 3, ‘I don’t know how to do it.’ No. 4, ‘I don’t think it’ll be delicious,’” he explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To develop a cookbook of one-pot recipes, Buettner said, “I started with these criteria: that every recipe had to take less than 20 minutes to combine, it had to cost less than three bucks a serving, and it had to be maniacally delicious.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

            Thanksgiving apparently did not get the longevity-promoting memo, since many of the dishes Americans typically love to devour during the feast are a few sticks of butter in excess of being health-promoting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00133b6n5u4pbucv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that doesn’t mean you have to toss the turkey out with the gravy. Small tweaks can help you align your holiday meal with blue-zone eating patterns. Here are Buettner’s five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00143b6npl29y98k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/2022/11/the-true-first-thanksgiving/" target="_blank"&gt;original Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; staples — beans, corn and squash — are also three of the most longevity-boosting foods on the planet, Buettner said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00153b6n7a1iputd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He noted that versions of this nutrient-packed trio are not just part of traditional Native American diets, but also those of people living in the blue zones  of Costa Rica’s Nicoya region and the island of Icaria in Greece.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00163b6n4s51f03h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Build your menu around these, and you’re already eating like centenarians.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001e3b6ntfu7s341@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Add a longevity-boosting salad or vegetable-forward side dish (or two) to the feast, Buettner suggested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001f3b6nba7z93x8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Blue-zone tables are full of leafy greens: mustard greens, collards, wild arugula, fennel fronds,” he said. “A simple, herb-heavy salad or roasted seasonal vegetables can lighten a traditionally heavy meal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001g3b6nodx7ojil@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s a side dish recipe from “One Pot Meals” to try:

            &lt;strong&gt;For the glaze&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;For the carrots&lt;/strong&gt;

            12 ounces carrots, peeled (about 5 medium carrots)
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;

      &lt;li data-editable="items.8.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            ¼ cup carrot greens or fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            In a ramekin or small bowl, whisk together the glaze ingredients until the honey is dissolved, then set aside.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Cut the carrots lengthwise in half or quarters so that the widest ends are about ¼ inch thick.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Toss the carrots in the oil to coat evenly, then add the salt and spices and toss again.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Spread the carrots in a single layer on a13-x-9-inch sheet pan, with curved sides facing up.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.5.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Roast the carrots for 30 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven. Drizzle the glaze over the carrots, and return to the oven for 5 more minutes.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.6.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Garnish with the chopped greens before serving.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            In accompaniments calling for refined grains, swap in whole-grain alternatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001n3b6n6nb2zvu6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Instead of white rolls or refined stuffing, try whole-grain sourdough, barley or wild rice,” Buettner said. “These keep blood sugar stable and keep you fuller with fewer calories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001o3b6nugbks8mu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even if you go with your favorites, you can tweak them to be healthier, as Buettner does in his take on whipped potatoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Trim any dark spots off the potatoes, then halve or quarter the potatoes so all the pieces are roughly the same size, about 2 inches across.

            Instead of piling up your plate with every dessert on offer, try to reframe the way you think about the course.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “You don’t need to ban dessert, just change the equation,” Buettner said. “In Sardinia, people enjoy a single simple sweet after meals, not an avalanche of pies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Another option: Try naturally sweet foods like baked apples, roasted squash or dates, he suggested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Strengthen ties with family and friends
&lt;/h2&gt;

            Make the holiday social, active and purposeful. “A blue-zone Thanksgiving doesn’t end at the table,” Buettner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002h3b6n1of245hu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nor does it start there. “Play a game, ask everyone to share a gratitude story or include elders in the cooking,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002i3b6nl7tf2s8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And, post-meal, head outside for a stroll, not to the couch — at least not right away!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002j3b6nqukqy1ij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Longevity isn’t just about what’s on the plate,” he said. “It’s the whole web of connection around it.”

Maybe you’re mentally wiped after socializing all day, or your brain is fried from hours of work. If you got up early, it could simply be that you’d rather crawl under a blanket and watch Netflix than interact with other people—all of these are legitimate reasons to feel cranky during this time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But in people with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62854242/how-to-improve-brain-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62854242/how-to-improve-brain-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dementia" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;—which is an umbrella term for mental decline and can be related to a number of diseases such as Alzheimer's—there’s a phenomenon known as “sundowning,” where symptoms (such as being agitated or anxious) ramp up later in the day and evening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;As you head into the holiday season, you’re likely spending more time than usual with older loved ones. With that, it’s worth it for any adult to better understand how sundowning presents, and what it might mean for the cognitive health of your loved one. We tapped two health care providers who treat older adults for more information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="body-tip css-mtq1aa emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="4.0"&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/shannel-elhelou/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/shannel-elhelou/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shannel Kassis Elhelou" data-node-id="4.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Shannel Kassis Elhelou&lt;/a&gt;, PsyD, is a geropsychology and neuropsychology fellow at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Brain Wellness and Lifestyle Programs at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" target="_blank" title="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fred Kobylarz" data-node-id="4.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Fred Kobylarz&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is co-director of the Center for Healthy Aging at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="sundowning-is-a-term-that-refers-to-behavior-changes-in-people-with-dementia-that-occur-at-a-particular-time-of-day" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="5.0"&gt;‘Sundowning’ is a term that refers to behavior changes in people with dementia that occur at a particular time of day.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Also known as “sundowner’s syndrome,” sundowning is a set of symptoms or behaviors that can be seen in some people with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/sleep-issues-sundowning" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/sleep-issues-sundowning" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer’s Association" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“This usually happens as the dementia progresses,” says &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" target="_blank" title="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/fred-kobylarz" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fred Kobylarz" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Fred Kobylarz&lt;/a&gt;, MD, co-director of the Center for Healthy Aging at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. “It is not a disease, but a symptom of dementia.” Unfortunately, doctors “don’t really know the cause of this,” he adds. It's possible that sundowning in dementia patients is caused by a combination of hormonal changes, brain deterioration or damage that has occurred, environmental factors, disruption to a person's circadian rhythm, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="8" class="body-h4 css-ijdjx3 emevuu60"&gt;Symptoms of sundowning can vary by person, but they &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/sleep-issues-sundowning" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alz.org/help-support/caregiving/stages-behaviors/sleep-issues-sundowning" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="can include" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;can include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="9" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.0"&gt;     Anxiety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.1"&gt;     Agitation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.2"&gt;     Pacing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.3"&gt;     Disorientation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.4"&gt;     Hallucinations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="9.5"&gt;     Trouble sleeping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Sundowning “typically occurs in the late afternoon and evening in individuals diagnosed with dementia,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/shannel-elhelou/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/shannel-elhelou/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shannel Kassis Elhelou" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Shannel Kassis Elhelou&lt;/a&gt;, PsyD, a geropsychology and neuropsychology fellow at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Brain Wellness and Lifestyle Programs at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. However, Dr. Kobylarz notes it can start as early as 1 p.m. for some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-sundowning-looks-like" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;What Sundowning Looks Like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There’s a difference between being totally over your day and sundowning. In addition to the symptoms listed above, sundowning can include verbal or even physical outbursts, Elhelou says. That may mean lashing out when dinner isn’t what they thought it would be or getting frustrated when they can’t find something. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Some people may even want to be physically closer than usual to loved ones, following them closely “for reassurance,” Elhelou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;For others, sundowning can show up as confusion. “They will not remember conversations from earlier in the day or what they ate,” Dr. Kobylarz says. That can including wanting to eat dinner again right after finishing a meal they don't remember. People also may not remember where their home is or the loved ones who take care of them, Dr. Kobylarz  says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“You can see [the person with dementia] change at a certain time of the day and almost become another person,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-sundowning-be-a--sign-of-early-dementia" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Can Sundowning Be A Sign Of Early Dementia? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Sundowning is often a symptom that happens &lt;em data-node-id="17.1"&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; someone is diagnosed with dementia or a dementia-related disease, but it can also be an early sign of mental decline itself. “There are changes taking place in the brain,” Dr. Kobylarz explains, that lead to the onset of dementia and continue as it progresses. So, it is possible for someone to exhibit sundowning behaviors who has not yet been diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="18" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;“While sundowning is more common in dementia, it is not exclusive to it.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Elhelou stresses that if you notice a loved one showing signs of sundowning, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee that they have dementia. “While sundowning is more common in dementia, it is not exclusive to it,” she notes. “Similar symptoms can occasionally be seen in older adults &lt;em data-node-id="19.1"&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; dementia, particularly when they are ill or experiencing delirium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-distinguish-sundowning-from-typical-aging" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;How To Distinguish Sundowning From Typical Aging &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Again, it’s completely normal to feel like you’re not the best version of yourself when it’s later in the day, especially for older adults. That goes double over the holidays, when everyone is stressed and overstimulated. But sundowning has some unique signs that make it stand out from just being tired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Fatigue can occur at all times of the day.  Sundowning is truly confusion,” Dr. Kobylarz says. “If you have fatigue, you can take a catnap and feel refreshed. With sundowning, they are not usually fatigued, and they are ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Sundowning also tends to happen consistently around the same time of day, Elhelou says. “It often includes cognitive effects such as significant disorientation or impaired judgement,” she says. If someone is experiencing actual sundowning, they’re also likely to still display symptoms even after they rest, Elhelou points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-help-a-loved-one-manage-sundowning" data-node-id="25" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="25.0"&gt;How To Help A Loved One Manage Sundowning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Managing sundowning means trying to figure out your loved one’s new rhythm. “Managing sundowning should include a regular routine with scheduling and caregiving—essentially knowing their best time of day,” Dr. Kobylarz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While Elhelou says it can be “challenging” to manage sundowning, she recommends creating a calm environment and routine as best you can. “Start by maintaining a consistent daily routine to reduce confusion and fatigue,” she says. “Encourage activities and exposure to natural light during the day to support healthy sleep-wake cycles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It's also crucial to try to avoid overstimulation in the evenings by limiting loud noises, bright screens, or large gatherings. “Address physical needs, such as hunger, thirst, or discomfort to ensure they feel secure,” Elhelou says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Again, showing symptoms of sundowning doesn’t automatically mean that your loved one has dementia—but it is something to get checked out. “As soon as you suspect sundowning changes in your loved one, bring this this up with [their] doctor,” Dr. Kobylarz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The doctor can look for potential underlying causes, including dementia, medication effects, or environmental factors, Elhelou says. From there, they can suggest effective ways to help you manage the behavioral changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

          &lt;p&gt;ProPublica has &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/bird-flu-airborne-usda-pandemic" target="_blank"&gt;More evidence that bird flu spreads by air&lt;/a&gt; from farm to farm, but the government stubbornly adheres to the tracked-in hypothesis, despite the utter failure of such biosecurity measures to stop the spread.  Flu spreads from animal to animal via droplets, why is this such an argument?&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the precarious state of public health agencies under the Orange Menace, it is my hope that the information &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; can be infectious, spread widely to all your contacts, in the hope of promoting self-defense from disease. Knowledge is the best inoculation against misinformation!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Neuroscientists at the University of Cambridge have suggested he may have slightly overestimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When it comes to the brain, research suggests there are actually five distinct ages — including an adolescent phase that extends into your thirties and a period of stable high performance that ends in your mid-sixties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar who led the research, said: “We know the brain’s wiring is crucial to our development, but we lack a big picture of how it changes across our lives and why. This study is the first to identify major phases of &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/get-britain-reading/article/how-bedtime-stories-synchronise-your-childs-brain-with-yours-vc3b2mfp8" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;brain wiring&lt;/a&gt; across a&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; human lifespan.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Her team analysed MRI scans from more than 3,800 people, ranging from infants to individuals in their nineties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The results, published in Nature Communications, revealed four pivotal turning points — around the ages of 9, 32, 66 and 83 — that divide a human life into five “epochs” of brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;During the first, from birth to about the age of nine, the connections between separate areas of the brain become less efficient. It takes more effort to send information between distant regions. If the brain were a city, its roads would be more convoluted, taking longer to travel from one neighbourhood to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/brain-fog-after-poor-sleep-uncovered-research-0j2wzj0zd" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brain fog in the morning? Scientists now know why&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, within each neighbourhood, the brain is getting better at specialised tasks. Clusters of neurones start building stronger, tighter bonds — a process known as local segregation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The first significant shift, at the age of nine, coincides with a surge in cognitive skills but also rising vulnerability to mental health disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The connections linking separate regions start to work more effectively. Communication between disparate brain areas becomes much more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This period, which lasts until 32, has been described by the researchers as a surprisingly lengthy adolescent phase. It builds to a moment of peak performance, most commonly in a person’s early thirties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Next comes a plateau, stretching from about 32 to 66, during which measures of intelligence and personality traits tend to remain stable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/human-mind-peak-age-fb58z2mr2" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forget youthful brilliance — the human mind actually peaks at 60&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The next structural shift, at about the age of 66 is marked by the start of a subtle deterioration in the brain’s white matter — the network of fibre-like cables that allow different regions to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The final turning point, at 83, ushers in a phase where different brain neighbourhoods become more isolated. Direct connections between regions break down. There’s an increased reliance on local networks — a neurological echo, perhaps, of Shakespeare’s “second childishness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Duncan Astle, a professor of neuroinformatics at Cambridge, who is senior author of the study, said: “Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Many neuro-developmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory and a whole host of different behaviours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He added: “Understanding that the brain’s structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 15:47:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPd1g3Y1NOVVRQZjFGWjhVbzZSSi1DeWZJLUMyZVJMUXF2YVlNdl9iV01mSXNkUThxWFlzY0J5OWNJVHVNOU1jNFFIb3FCYURkVlRNcUxlWC1fTXdJQXN6VkVDVGFwb0E1R2tHWjlyWGdKZXJTRFVCOWRkaTNoR182UHFoVy1jMzBFSE84UzhmVmJ1YWVYU2c</guid></item></channel></rss>
