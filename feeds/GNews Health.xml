              &lt;p&gt;Your next tattoo might be riskier than currently assumed, recent research suggests. Scientists found evidence of a potential link between tattoo ink and a higher risk of certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) conducted the study, published this January in BMC Public Health. They compared twins, finding that those who got tattoos had a significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with skin cancer and lymphoma. More research is needed to understand whether this connection is causal and the reasons behind it if so, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tattoos have become increasingly popular. According to a 2023 Pew survey, one-third of Americans &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/15/32-of-americans-have-a-tattoo-including-22-who-have-more-than-one/"&gt;currently sport a tat&lt;/a&gt;, with 22% having more than one. Given that, it’s important to know the potential long-term effects of tattoos, and the researchers say that not enough work has been done to understand whether tattoo ink could be carcinogenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To bridge this gap, they analyzed data from the Danish Twin Tattoo Cohort (DTTC). The DTTC was created in 2021 by SDU scientists to survey twin pairs about their tattoo history, with volunteers solicited from the long-running Danish Twin Registry, also &lt;a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/dtr"&gt;maintained&lt;/a&gt; at SDU. This allowed the researchers to know a person’s tattoo status and to track whether they later developed cancer. They specifically looked for cancer cases in parts of the body where particles of tattoo ink are known to deposit, such as the skin and lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All told, the researchers had information on nearly 6,000 adult twins, which they used to conduct two different types of studies that compared the cancer-related outcomes of tattooed and non-tattooed twins. In both designs, twins with tattoos were noticeably more likely to develop skin cancer and lymphoma than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The exact added risk associated with tattooing differed depending on the type of cancer, the characteristics of the tattoo, and other relevant factors like age. But the largest associated risk was seen with tattoos larger than the size of a palm—people with these tattoos had a risk two to three times higher of these cancers than people without tattoos at all. That’s key, because it’s a possible sign of a dose-response effect, which would strengthen the case for there being a real association here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are concerned that tattoo ink interacting with surrounding cells may have severe consequences,” the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This sort of research alone can’t be used to confirm a cause-and-effect relationship between tattoos and cancer. But twin studies in general do allow scientists to avoid many of the limitations of similar research (because twins are so genetically and often environmentally alike, there’s less noise in the data to worry about). There have also been at least four other studies in recent years examining this issue. Three of these &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00228-1/fulltext"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, two of &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cam4.70260"&gt;which&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/abstract/2020/05000/cosmetic_tattooing_and_early_onset_basal_cell.20.aspx"&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; at U.S. residents, have suggested a possible link, while one &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/29/10/2093/124436/Tattoos-and-Hematologic-Malignancies-in-British?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to find any relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, there could still be other explanations. People who get tattoos may be more likely to engage in other cancer-linked behaviors like smoking and drinking. So having a tattoo may simply be an indirect marker of increased cancer risk generally, not a cause of it. Tattoos might also lessen the chances of someone noticing their skin cancer early,, which could then lead to worse outcomes (in this scenario, tattoos wouldn’t be causing cancers, but would be making them more dangerous).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another lingering question, assuming this connection is genuine, is exactly what’s behind it. It’s possible that tattoo ink can agitate our body’s cells in a particular way, causing inflammation or other changes that could fuel cancer formation. Some research has also found that ingredients found in certain ink colors, such as black or red, are more harmful or allergy-inducing than others. The researchers didn’t find clear evidence of a color effect in their study but aren’t yet discounting that it could be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In any case, the team says that more research is needed to get to the bottom of this potential issue. “Studies that pinpoint the etiological pathway of tattoo ink-induced carcinogenesis are recommended,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

For the first time in five years, I feel confident, I feel the difference. Making a change is possible, it can happen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What he didn't realize was that his rapid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-28216040-040c-11f0-96bb-71ecf3495362"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; was silently causing devastating health effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The father-of-four now claims in a lawsuit against the doctor who treated him, that he has so much pain in his joints, muscles and stomach after taking Ozempic that he spends up to 18 hours a day in bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fatty tissue in his ears have also deteriorated at such a rate that he is plagued by 'severe equilibrium and imbalance issues, making it hard for him to stand and walk, especially up and down steps'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple affidavits in connection with the lawsuit claim that he can also no longer communicate, he suffers from memory loss, and experiences quadruple vision at times. Weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy have been linked to a rare eye condition that can cause vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts and his wife Stacey are suing Dr Tony Puopolo, who prescribed him the weight &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14507013/Pharmacist-warns-rise-painful-digestive-disease-jabs-Mounjaro.html"&gt;loss drugs via LifeMD, for medical malpractice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being resigned to being obese, Brad Roberts couldn't believe it when he lost 24lbs in a month on weight loss drugs. However, in a shocking turn of events, the 44-year-old father-of-four and his wife Stacey are suing the doctor who prescribed him the weight loss drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family, who are seeking damages of $35.8 million, claim in court records that during November 2022 and 2023 the doctor over-prescribed a combination of 'overlapping', and sometimes unapproved, drugs to speed up his weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point the complaint reveals that Roberts, a former high-flying chief operating officer, was losing up to 3.5lbs a week, which exceeds the recommended weight loss rates of around 1 to 2lbs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brent Wilkerson, who has treated Roberts since 2023 for his hearing issues, adds in the suit that because the fat surrounding his ear tubes shrank so fast, he is no longer able to hear property and 'everything sounds muffled as if he were underwater, all while constantly experiencing tinnitus (ringing in the ears)'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his assessment of Roberts' condition, he continues in court documents: 'Loud noises make the tinnitus worse, causing severe piercing pain, pressure and migraine headaches. He wears wool caps over his ears in an attempt to muffle loud sounds.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudden and rapid weight-loss can cause the fatty tissue surrounding the Eustachian tubes, which connect your ears to the back of your throat, to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause the tubes to stay open when they should be shut, and ultimately result in hearing issues that are rarely but increasingly being reported by those on Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts has undergone at least six surgeries to try and remedy his hearing problems but he says with no success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another one of the court documents obtained by the Daily Mail, Dr Yadira Lockard, a psychologist who has served as Roberts' therapist since January 2015, describes his deterioration after he was allegedly 'dangerously' overmedicated with weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Off the back of his transformation Roberts landed a role in a commercial advertising the drugs for his employer at the time, the telehealth giant LifeMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roberts and his wife Stacey are suing Dr Tony Puopolo, who prescribed him the weight loss drugs via LifeMD, for medical malpractice &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She states: 'Roberts does not have the mental capacity to make life decision of any particular consequence to himself or on behalf of his family.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lockard says in the suit she noticed a rapid decline with Roberts around December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, she says that she treated him regularly for mental health matters and 'issues in the ordinary course including generalized anxiety' and nothing led her to question his 'capacity to make financial or personal decisions'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was an active and involved father and husband,' she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, around December 2023, a year into his weight loss, Dr Lockard claims in the suit she started noticing a concerning change in Roberts' behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-bf7c2f60-0371-11f0-bf40-edd94db96d4c" class=""&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;: 'Roberts began to complain to me that his medical ailments had impacted his ability to function normally and had rendered it impossible for him to follow and / or understand his email correspondence, transmit email correspondence, read and understand correspondence that he received and focus and / or concentrate on any communication (whether oral or written).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts allegedly complained, according to the suit, that he could not bank, drive more than a few minutes at a time or engage in intimate acts with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York-based Dr Robert Cooper, who has specialized in diabetes for more than 25 years, warns that the overuse of GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic can have devastating consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one of the affidavits, he notes: &lt;span&gt;'If GLP-1s are sufficiently overprescribed, whether it is in the same medication or the same class of medication, it will result in adverse effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, pancreatitis, biliary pathology, hypoglycemia, and even death.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As noted by Dr Wilkerson, Roberts' therapist Dr Lockard says in her statement that she also found Roberts 'complained (and continues to complain) of excruciating pain in both ears'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on some of the other complaints he relayed to her during therapy sessions, Dr Lockard reveals: 'His teeth are constantly in pain and feel soft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At one point he said he was losing up to 3.5lbs a week on weight loss drugs, which exceeds the recommended weight loss of around 1 to 2lbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The roof of his mouth is almost constantly burning, but at other times his whole mouth feels ice cold. His tongue feels swollen and he cannot eat anything that is firm. He relies on soft foods and protein shakes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although there is not much research around the effect of weight loss medications on oral health Dr Fatima Khan, a dentist and co-founder of Riven Oral Care in Maryland, says that some of the things she has heard of include acidic tastes in the mouth, enamel erosion, sensitive teeth and tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because some weight loss drugs, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic and Wegovy, can cause acid reflux or heartburn as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with his physical health being impacted, Dr Lockard says in the suit that Roberts is also suffering from neurocognitive deficits with 'holes in his memory that never previously existed' and 'limited short-term memories'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms Dr Lockard says she has observed include tremors, slurred speech, brain fog, and dizziness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concludes in one of the court documents: 'Regrettably, none of the ailments described have abated and, in my professional opinion, have grown worse and appear unlikely to abate in the future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts alleges in the suit that his weight loss medications were prescribed after a video consultation with Dr Puopolo via LifeMD and no follow-up appointments were scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also claims he was not warned about the potential side effects or of other treatments available.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York-based Dr Robert Cooper, who has specialized in diabetes for more than 25 years, says in the suit that from the evidence he has seen, that he believes Dr Puopolo was negligent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He concludes: 'If GLP-1s are sufficiently overprescribed, whether it is in the same medication or the same class of medication, it will result in adverse effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, pancreatitis, biliary pathology, hypoglycemia, and even death.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No trial date has been set to resolve the case. In response to the allegations against Dr Puopolo, who was working through the platform LifeMD at the time, a spokesperson told the Daily Mail: 'As we have explained in our court filings, the allegations in the case are meritless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have already made a motion to the court to have the case dismissed as a matter of law, and we look forward to the court's decision on that motion.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic was originally developed to treat type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-a55ab3d0-034f-11f0-bf40-edd94db96d4c" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; by lowering blood sugar levels. Diabetes can be genetic – known as type 1 diabetes, but around three quarters of the 38.4 million cases in the US are type 2 and caused by poor diet and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After studies revealed that the drug, which falls into the category of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist (GLP-1s) injections, was a highly effective appetite-suppressant, the weekly injections were repurposed to treat weight-loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, 92 percent of new Ozempic users had been diagnosed with diabetes. By 2021, this had fallen to 77 percent and continues to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some experts said there is no solid evidence to support Ozempic-induced tinnitus or hearing loss and claim the incidents are very rare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests patients taking Ozempic, which contains an active ingredient called semaglutide, can lose up to 15 per cent of their body weight within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those taking another GLP-1 drug called Mounjaro lose as much as a fifth of their body weight over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around a fifth of people who take weight-loss injections suffer from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. For most, these issues fade after several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of greater concern are reports of pancreatitis. This causes inflammation of the pancreas, an organ in the abdomen which produces digestive hormones. In some cases, pancreatitis can be life-threatening and trigger organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, a study carried out by researchers at Harvard University last year concluded that taking Ozempic doubles the risk of a rare condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This medical emergency occurs when blood flow to the nerves of the eye becomes blocked, causing vision loss. But despite the increased risk, the condition is still thought to only occur in one in every 4,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are not any official warnings about hearing problems associated with Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But like Robers, patients in online support groups are increasingly raising the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Daily Mail has reached out to Novo Nordisk (the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and Eli Lilly and Company (the maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) for comment on Roberts' case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies write job postings carefully in hopes of attracting the ideal candidate. However, they may unknowingly attract &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-021-04761-z"&gt;and select&lt;/a&gt; narcissistic candidates whose goals and ethics might not align with a company’s values or long-term success. Research shows that narcissistic employees are more likely &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-51276"&gt;to behave unethically&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-012-1528-7"&gt;legal consequences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While narcissistic traits can lead to negative outcomes, we aren’t saying that companies should avoid attracting narcissistic applicants altogether. Consider a company hiring a salesperson. A firm can benefit from a salesperson who is persuasive, who “thinks outside the box,” and who is “results-oriented.” In contrast, a company hiring an accountant or compliance officer would likely benefit from someone who “thinks methodically” and “communicates in a straightforward and accurate manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bending the rules is of particular concern in accounting. A significant amount of research examines how accounting managers sometimes bend rules or massage the numbers to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacceco.2005.01.002"&gt;achieve earnings targets&lt;/a&gt;. This “earnings management” can misrepresent the company’s true financial position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, my co-author &lt;a href="https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/nick-seybert"&gt;Nick Seybert&lt;/a&gt; is currently &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5135440"&gt;working on a paper&lt;/a&gt; whose data suggests rule-bender language in accounting job postings predicts rule-bending in financial reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current findings shed light on the importance of carefully crafting job posting language. Recruiting professionals may instinctively use rule-bender language to try to attract someone who seems like a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1996.tb01790.x"&gt;good fit&lt;/a&gt;. If companies are concerned about hiring narcissists, they may want to clearly communicate their ethical values and needs while crafting a job posting, or avoid rule-bender language entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What still isn’t known&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we find that professional recruiters are using language that attracts narcissists, it is unclear whether this is intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we are unsure what really drives rule-bending in a company. Rule-bending could happen due to attracting and hiring more narcissistic candidates, or it could be because of a company’s culture—or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231"&gt;Research Brief&lt;/a&gt; is a short take on interesting academic work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A paper looking at &lt;a href="/policy-and-politics/2020/1/17/21046874/netherlands-universal-health-insurance-private"&gt;Dutch patients&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26150550/"&gt;detected higher mortality rates&lt;/a&gt; after one month for patients who had Friday surgeries compared to Monday. This appears to be a phenomenon no matter the country, as prior &lt;a href="https://oce.ovid.com/article/00007719-201508000-00026"&gt;US-based research&lt;/a&gt; also attests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The new study covered all surgery specialties — including orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery, and obstetrics — and followed patients’ outcomes at 30 days, 90 days and one year.

&lt;p&gt;What if, alongside a little Ultherapy for a saggy neck and a few zaps of Clear + Brilliant laser for loathsome sun spots, you could boost your mood and zap brain fog on the same office visit? Courtesy of a new magnetic-field treatment dubbed &lt;a href="https://bodybybtl.com/solutions/exomind/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Exomind&lt;/a&gt;, patients of Manhattan dermatologist Dr. &lt;a href="https://pfrankmd.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Paul Jarrod Frank&lt;/a&gt; can do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And no one sounds more excited about Exomind than Frank himself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I actually went to medical school to become a psychiatrist, and I feel that I use my skills and background in psychology every day,” Frank says. “With the overwhelming demand and advancements in functional and longevity medicine, beauty, health, and wellness no longer sit on opposite ends of the cafeteria. They are all integrally woven into helping people achieve the best version of themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That level of self-actualization doesn’t come cheap; at Frank’s practice, the recommended six-session course of treatment clocks in at $4,800. And while the skin doc assures that lasting effects kick-in after the third session, most partakers can expect occasional maintenance visits to stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created by Prague-based medical device purveyor BTL, Exomind is a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment designed to improve mental and emotional well-being and is FDA-approved for the treatment of depression. In Canada, it also gets the green light for helping to tackle anxiety, OCD and issues with compulsive eating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Frank, who deploys multiple BTL-crafted devices at his practice, including Emsculpt for body contouring and Emsella for treating postpartum incontinence, Exomind is based on well-established technology called TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation). To drill down the science, magnetic fields are used to boost neuron activity in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the portion of the brain that regulates mood and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The problem with the older versions of TMS technology is that they were very time-consuming, requiring multiple consecutive days for hours at a time,” says Frank. “It wasn’t realistic for patients unless they had severe emotional and mental disease states.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Frank isn’t expecting his own patient population to seek out Exomind for the treatment of major mental illness, they may be looking for help with dealing with digital distraction and the stress and anxiety of city life. And for many, the hope of getting off prescription meds via soothing, 30-minute Exomind sessions is enough of a lure to give them a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City-based media buyer Olivia Kessler, who completed her sixth Exomind session at the PFrankMD Upper East Side office in February, found the treatments so chill she even fell asleep during one of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having already tried Emsculpt, Kessler was familiar with the technology and trusted Frank’s suggestion that Exomind might be another tool in her kit to help with mood swings generated by her longstanding PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A “naturally stressed” city dweller who says she feels the need to be hypervigilant at all times, Kessler was also seeking an alternative to the generic version of Prozac her doctor prescribed for dealing with her pre-menstrual emotional rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only has Exomind helped with mood regulation, it’s also curbed any tendency Kessler had toward procrastination. “I feel like I have a pep in my step,” she says, “a little extra energy that I didn’t have before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Kessler, parking herself on Frank’s office couch with an electro-magnetic skullcap for half an hour at a pop has been worth the time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I have to tell you, as a parent, something I think about a lot is how to have real, authentic conversations with my three teenage daughters. It can be hard sometimes. I realize that things are different for their generation. They have smartphones and screens and influencers. There is news that is constantly blaring everywhere. It's a different time. And a lot has changed right down to our biology. Take, for instance, puberty. It's one of the most awkward and yet important stages of growing up. But even that has changed. The average start of puberty in the United States now begins at eight years old for girls and nine for boys. Some kids are going through puberty even earlier than that. It also last much longer than it did before. For some people, puberty can last for up to a decade. Just think about that. All of this might come as a surprise to you.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:00:58
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              People know a lot about the puberty they went through, but it is not the same now.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:01:05
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's doctor Cara Natterson. She's a pediatrician and she's a parent. She's author of the New York Times bestselling series for girls called The Care and Keeping of You. She also has a sequel for boys called Guy stuff. She's an expert on puberty, so I decided to sit down to talk to her and try and learn. Why are kids going through puberty earlier, and is that early puberty really the new norm? I think most importantly for me, as a dad of three teenage girls, what do parents need to know about how to help their children navigate it? I'm Doctor Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, and this is chasing life. So if you're a parent and I'm just guessing we're around the same age because I know you have two college athletes who are teenagers still, I think, or maybe early 20s, and I have three teenagers. So right around that same age, the way that we think about puberty is parents. But even I think as physicians may be totally different than than what our kids are going through. You're a pediatrician, so you obviously have updated knowledge, but for me, as just a dad, it's a totally different thing compared to 30, 40, 50 years ago.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:25
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Even up until the late 1990s, we were all taught in medical school that puberty begins around 11 or 11.5 and it takes about two, three, four years. It's a sprint and you get through it and it's super awkward and your body changes and then you're done. That was sort of the teaching and the medical school more detailed teaching was not a whole lot more detailed. It was that the path through puberty were these stages called the Tanner stages. And Tanner looked at breast development. He looked at penile and testicular growth, and he looked at hair growth. And he did these studies in the 1940s and 50s and 60s. In an orphanage outside of London. And that's where he collected all of his data. So five stages, Tanner one. Nothing's happening. You're not in it. Tanner five, you're totally done. And two, three and four. That's puberty. Girls go into puberty around age 11. They're earlier kids or later kids. But that was about it. And boys around 11.5 now. And we started to get this knowledge in the late 1990s, when a study was published by a doctor of public health named Marsha Herman Giddens. She published a study, 17,000 girls, that showed, nope, it's not 11 anymore. It's ten. And in fact, if you looked at kids according to their race, kids who are black. Their average age of pubertal onset was even earlier, and we could talk about that study and what that did, but that really rocked the world. And that was more than 25 years ago, by the way. And then more data came out. And Louise Greenspan, with others, published data in 2010 that looked to confirm that original data. And it didn't just confirm it, it moved the starting point even further. So starting in 2010, right, 14 years ago, we knew that the average age of breast development for a girl fell somewhere between 8 and 9 in this country. And for boys, the start of puberty looks like testicular and penile growth, which frankly, most parents have no idea is happening. I did not know it was happening in my own house, because it's when boys tend to get private, but that average age is between 9 and 10. So that's different. That's two years different from when we were growing up.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:04:57
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So 11, 11.5 was what the onset of puberty. That's the age that we all sort of learned, at least when we were in medical school. And now it's become younger, maybe even as young as eight. Is that normal puberty now or is that considered early onset puberty or early puberty? How do you refer to it?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:18
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I love this question because I think definition of terms is the most important starting place. Right. So 8 to 9 is an average. Normal can be earlier than eight for some groups of girls. So as a pediatrician, when I was starting in practice in the year 2000, if a kid had secondary sex characteristics, if their bodies were starting to change, usually it meant breast development. And it happened before age eight. They would come into my office to see me. That was considered atypical or abnormal. Now that post has moved back to seven. So if a kid is younger than seven, they'll come see a pediatrician. But if they're over seven. Most advice is that is within the normal range. Oh, and by the way, if they're 12 and nothing has happened, that is also normal. So now wrap your brain around a 5 or 6 year spread of normal onset of body changes. That's really hard for everyone to manage. And I'll add one more term that's really important. So puberty in its narrowest definition means the path to sexual maturation. So when you start puberty. You cannot be part of a baby making equation, and when you finish puberty, you can potentially be part of making a baby. That's the definition of puberty very narrowly. The broader definition, as we talked about earlier, is all the other downstream shifts from all of those sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen and progesterone floating around the body in the brain? Mood swings, friendships shifts, shifts in the way kids make decisions.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:21
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think the point is puberty isn't always straightforward. Things that seem like puberty, using that narrow definition might technically not be puberty.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:32
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              There's this thing called adrenarche that is caused when the adrenal glands release their hormones, DHEA and DHEA s, and these hormones are cousins of estrogen and testosterone. Nostrum. And when the adrenal glands release these hormones, these hormones tell the body to make more sweat and in certain places to make it with greasier thicker proteins and to sprout more hair. Some places it's new hair, some places the hair texture and color changes that sweat hair. You can imagine how body odor and pimples are related. Right? That is not puberty. That's called adrenarche. It happens around the same time as puberty. But in some kids it can happen much earlier. So a five year old can have pubic hair and they're not in puberty. Or a 15 year old can be well through puberty and have no body odor, no greasiness, and no pubic hair growth. It's confusing.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:08:47
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Adrenarche and puberty can be totally disparate in terms of is there a relationship at all between. Yes. I mean.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:08:53
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, because the hormones are all cousins and they can convert forms. So DHEA and DHEAS can convert into testosterone and forms of estrogen. I should add, people always ask about where body weight fits in. And the answer to that is in many bodies that carry extra weight, they have what what's called peripheral conversion of these hormones. So DHEA and DHEAS when they're floating around, the body can convert more easily into the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone when there's more body fat, which is one of the bridges that connects this, which is one of the reasons why kids who carry extra body weight tip into puberty, typically a little earlier.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:09:45
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This is fascinating. And I mean, the question I think a lot of people will ask which are which are addressing here is, is why over the last 30, 40 or 50 years, has puberty become something that is happening younger and younger? I, you know, again, this is just me, me talking here. I had heard about high body weight being a concern because of, as you say, what the added fat might do. I had also heard about potential environmental factors playing a role here, and I'm curious what what your thoughts are on that. But this idea of stress hormones, you know, I think of stress hormones as sort of short acting hormones. The idea that sort of a persistent exposure to high levels, for example, of cortisol, could also be a culprit in tipping people into puberty earlier. I had not considered that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:10:37
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. So the cortisol is for sure a short acting hormone. But when your adrenal glands are pumping it out 24 over seven. Because you're on social media reacting to what you're seeing, or because you're living in a stressful environment where you're expected to be an academic achiever or an athletic achiever, or if you're living in a stressful environment because you don't know where your next meal is coming from, or you don't know where you're going to sleep that night. So all of these things are what we call stressors. And by the way, there's no value judgment to be placed on which stressor is more or less important. But now you can see why every kid is exposed to stress, quote unquote stress, right? We love to throw around that term. What does it mean? It means anything that tells your adrenal glands to pump out cortisol. And the stressors are there all the time. They're there all the time. When we went to school, we came home at the end of the day, and any dynamic that happened at school was left at school. Maybe someone called us on the corded phone and maybe one of our siblings. Let us take the call. Otherwise they were busy on the corded phone. Right now there is round the clock. Social dynamics. Romantic dynamics. Right. But I don't want to demonize this either. I think it's really, really important to be level about all this. I mean, social media, for instance. For sure. There's a connection here. But social media has also been shown to save lives, to build community for people who are marginalized and don't have it. It's too easy to be black and white about this. And so I think it's very important for us to recognize the role of stress and stressors, but also to recognize that some of the things we call stressors have huge upsides and huge positive benefits. I would never argue that the aces, the adverse childhood experiences that cause stress like food insecurity, financial insecurity, housing insecurity, witnessing violence, living in a traumatic situation. There is no upside to any of those stressors, but a lot of these sort of stressors in lives that are less challenged by ACS have positives and negatives.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Stress in and of itself is not the enemy. It's the relentless nature of stress, I guess, is what I'm hearing you say.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But I don't want to send people, you know, sort of screaming for the hills and stressed out because it is not a switch which goes from 0 to 100. With puberty. When we were growing up, the path for puberty was fast. Today, even though it's starting earlier, it is actually happening more slowly. So it's not like an eight year old wakes up one morning in the body of an 18 year old. It is not what's happening. What is happening is eight year olds. If their girls might be developing breast buds, they might just have breast buds for a while. It is not like they are going to have their full adult breast size immediately. And this is another thing that is layering sort of the confusion and the, the, the sense of I don't know how to help the kid in my life. Parents don't know how seriously to take any of this. And there's worry. I mean, it's just it's a mess. It's a mess of information that is so easily remedied with just some simple facts. So fact one puberty is starting earlier. Fact two it's going slower. It's going slower. Girls are getting their period a little bit earlier than they used to, but not three years earlier. It's more like somewhere between 3 and 6 months.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:14:42
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              What about the racial divide? So when you take all these factors that could potentially be causing puberty to happen sooner. Why? Why racial divide?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:14:51
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Every researcher that I trust is landing at the same conclusion, which it's going to turn out not to be race. It's going to turn out to be zip code. So if you take this explanation of cortisol being at the heart of everything that's going on, and you look at the way this country sets up and the socioeconomic divide and the racial divide, it's you can't argue that the two are not completely overlapped. It's a very, very hard to look at the sociological data and say, oh, yes, we can account for racial shifts in puberty separate from zip code, socioeconomic shifts and puberty. So it's kids who are more stressed and more under-resourced, who are entering puberty the soonest. Now everyone's entering sooner. On average, the trend line is down because of something you mentioned earlier, which is these amorphous environmental causes. So the way I would describe that bucket is everything we put into and onto our body is impacting our body. Right? So it's everything from the toiletries, the cosmetics that we use, the shampoos and cleansers and moisturizers. Many, many, many of them contain chemicals in them that disrupt the hormones in our body. They change the way hormones signal. Likewise, the pollution in the air that we breathe impacts the way our bodies work, right? Everything. The water we're drinking, depending upon what's in the food we're eating, what's, you know, antibiotics that are pumped into animals that then end up on grocery shelves. There's tons of data that shows that those antibiotics shift the way our body's immune system works are inflammatory cascade. We have inflammation as a result that has impacts on the sex hormones. So it's a lot of things coming at us. But it's a reminder that there are some really incredible scientists out there who are trying to figure out what are these lowest common denominator chemicals that are showing up in these various environmental insults. We call them insults, right, that are changing the way the hormones work in our body so that we can get rid of them. And that's really important. And right now, the foods that don't have antibiotics are the toiletries Cosmetics that don't have a whole list of chemical ingredients tend to be more expensive. Right? So right. We're back to zip code. We're back to the socioeconomic drivers of puberty. So it's complicated.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              If you look at the data around the world, do you see differences geographically, by country or culture?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes. So net net puberty everywhere is starting earlier. And we've known this for a long time. And even in very remote areas we know that puberty is starting earlier. So that's that sort of global phenomenon of what people are putting into an onto their bodies and how chemicals are shifting the path through puberty. But it looks different from country to country and region to region. And the data is kind of all over the map. And in the US we tend to be a little bit on the earlier side. So the data shows our average start of puberty has been consistently at or below the average for the world.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:18:29
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So puberty happening earlier isn't just a thing happening in the United States. This is a global phenomenon. But I think the real question then is just how worried should we be about kids starting to develop earlier in life? And if we are worried, when then should we as parents get involved? We'll be right back. When we talk about blue zones and things like that, places where people live better, they live longer lives, they have more social connection. You can see the benefit, and the benefit usually is something like longevity. You live longer, you have a higher health span, things like that. The question that I really sort of struggle with when it comes to puberty is, is puberty starting earlier a bad thing?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:21
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We have no idea. I mean, because we have no data, right? So people ask this all the time, and the answer is we only have about 25,  26 years of evidence that puberty is really started to march earlier. And so the oldest of those kids are just in middle age now, right, entering middle age. So we don't know. But what we do know is there have been trends through history of when puberty has started earlier, when puberty has started later. We are so sure that earlier puberty is bad. And yet really, if you look back through the lens of history in cultures or in societies where there was no food available, what did those kids bodies do? Their bodies slowed down their development and puberty happened much later, and it makes great evolutionary sense. The whole point of puberty is to be able to be part of a baby making equation. If your body, if you are a female and your body cannot carry a fetus because you're so nutritionally deprived. You don't have the food you need. You don't have the nutritional resources. Well, then why would the body try to develop and get itself there in order to reproduce quickly? There's no rush. So there are times where you look through historical records, and the average age of pubertal onset is 16. And that's because in those societies there was a famine. And so I'm not saying earlier puberty is good. I think we have to put everything in context.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:02
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But just in terms of mental health risks. I've been reading some about this and how girls starting puberty earlier might come with added mental health risks. Is there evidence of that then? And do we know anything for boys as well?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:15
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So for girls, the data is pretty clear and it tethers to this early data about earlier puberty, earlier body changes, more sexualization, earlier risk for predation. If your body is changing. No one's talking to you about it, or the world thinks it's happening to you. Too young. So you're not getting informed in a certain way. But then the world is sexualizing you and expects for you to either think like you're older because you look like you're older, or to behave like you're older because you look like you're older. The set up for mental health issues is tremendous, right? Also, the sex hormones, whether they are estrogen and progesterone, which govern female puberty, or testosterone, which governs male puberty, they circle around the brain. They change the way the neurons fire. They change the way moods are expressed. You know, Louise Greenspan says the first sign of puberty is not breast development or penile and testicular growth. It is a slamming door. I love that line. It is absolutely true. And that is where third and fourth grade parents are like, wow, my kid is in puberty. They are slamming the door. I mean, that is all those hormones rising and falling and and coursing through the brain and changing the way the brain feels and the way it reacts. It has to be a set up for mental health issues if we are not talking about it. I will add for boys, there has been no study that looks at testosterone and quiet, but I am 100% convinced that when someone finally studies it, we will see that testosterone surges and drops are what cause the silence of tween and teen boys. We know testosterone causes rage, but the other side of that pendulum swing is silence. And it's not that they don't talk, but they talk less. And then they are rewarded for talking less or. Today's generation of parents goes well that was what I did. And I just shut my door for three years and my parents didn't say anything and was totally fine. And I emerged out the other end, and I'm okay. And that the truth is that was then. This is now that sign that you see in boys where they just become monosyllabic or grunts. It is painful for parents, it is hormonal and there are ways through it. There are conversations you can have with your boys. There are ways to pull them out of their shell. They do emerge out the other side, but they do want to be talked to. I swear. They tell us all the time, just because they're not talking a lot, doesn't mean that they don't want to be included in the conversation.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:24:06
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This is so fascinating. I mean, I think anyone listening, myself included, is thinking about those teens in their life, whether their own kids or kids friends. And it tracks. It's so interesting. I mean, it's fascinating. Let me ask you this. So if parents come to you and say that my kid seems to be going through puberty very early. What is the conversation that you'd have with parents?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:24:29
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So let's start with this thing. Any adult who thinks the kid in their life is going into puberty and they have a question or a concern, reach out to a health care provider. This is really important. What they need to do is they need to have a conversation, and then they need to do a physical exam, and they need to actually look at your kid. I am a pediatrician. I did not examine my own child. I did not know when my son went into puberty, but it was not my job to be his pediatrician and to examine him and to determine that. So I would take him in for his annual checkup, and if there were any concerns in between, I would take him in. And it was the pediatrician who had the conversation with him and examined him, and then I could pick up the conversation from their. Pediatricians are trained to ask parents to leave the room. By the time a kid is about somewhere 11, 12, 13, 14, they're going to kick the parent out at some point. That's totally appropriate. Then call him up, ask him, or at the end of the visit, pull him aside. Hey, is my kid in puberty or do I need to worry about anything? There are so many ways into the conversation, but hopefully the theme here is coming through that talking about it is the most important thing.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:25:54
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Puberty can on average starts around 8 or 9, but it can be 6 or 7, you said. So I have a kid. I think they may be going through puberty at a very young age. Should I be worried about that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:26:07
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So before age seven, for a girl, before age eight for a boy, I would say you would want to bring in medical advice. You start seeing changes in the body. You want to bring in a medical finger, but you noticed I'm not using the word concerned or worried because there are a lot of red herrings here. There are a lot of things that can look like puberty that aren't puberty.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:26:33
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But if it is happening before that age, what would the pediatrician be thinking?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:26:37
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              They're looking for what's called precocious puberty. And precocious puberty is puberty that's happening sooner than it should. And one of the causes of precocious puberty, which is not common, but it's always on the list for every pediatrician, is a tumor that is growing in the brain, that is telling the brain to secrete the hormones called LA and FSH, that tip the body into starting puberty. That's the main thing that people are looking for. It's a tumor that is causing the hormones to release early. But I hesitate to go down that road because more often than not, the concerns turn out to be not a worry, but a great opportunity for conversation with the pediatrician, right? So, for instance, if you have a kid who's carrying extra body weight and you think they're developing breasts and actually it's just fat tissue, and a doctor can examine them and show that it's just fat tissue and there's no breast tissue, it's still a great opportunity for a conversation about nutritional wellness.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right? Right. But what what are some of the approaches that you've implemented as a parent, with all you've known when it comes to talking about puberty?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:27:53
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              The best tip I have is what I did with my son, so that my oldest is her daughter, who is just a talker. But my son was not a talker. And when he went through puberty, he became really not a talker. And that was very hard for me. So the first thing I learned how to do was to sit on the other side of a closed door. So I would sit on the other side of my son's door and I would knock on the door and I would say, hey, buddy, I'm actually just sitting on the other side of the door, and I would really love to hear what's going on, and I'm going to be here for about 5 or 10 minutes. And if you want to talk, I'm just happy to sit here and talk. And it's so funny we did. My partner Vanessa and I did a podcast episode with our two sons who were going off to college this month, and there's a part of the podcast where I talk about this with my son, and I'm like, do you remember this? And he's of course, I remember it because it worked. We didn't have to look at each other. We didn't have to. There was no vulnerability. I wasn't there was no worry, you know? He was so aware of me being worried about everything right then. And there was none of that with a closed door between us. And then eventually the door opened. And then my strategy became. And it is still to this day, my strategy. Knock on the door. Always knock. Go in. He was almost invariably sitting at his desk in his chair, and I would go lay down on his bed and look straight up at the ceiling, and I'd be like, hey, then how you doing? And he'd start talking. No eye contact, but my laying on his bed and him sitting in his desk, at his desk, with his back to me, was a place and a way that we could get into some of our best conversations. That is a way of communicating with a kid that works. Everyone says do it in the car. Car is great on a walk. On a walk is great. You're just not making eye contact. So that's what worked for me, and I hope that other people can take that advice, because the parents who taught me that I'm forever grateful.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:30:03
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I get to tell you another piece of crucial advice is to just start having these conversations. Just start talking. Have the conversations. The big ones, the small ones, the silly ones, the serious ones. Because you gotta know this. In this day and age, our kids are exposed to a lot early, and some of what they're exposed to, like it or not, is not what any parent would want.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:30:26
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              The average age of first porn viewing in this country is 12. Really? Yeah. Wow. And 15% of ten year olds have seen it. So if you're not having conversations like this about all of this smells and feelings and sex and all of it, if you're not having those conversations with the kids in your lives, someone else is. So it's time to get over the awkwardness. Educate yourself. Find your own trusted adult. We always tell kids to find a trusted adult. Adult find your own trusted adult, you know, bounce things off of them, but start having these conversations. They can be short. You can have many of them over many years. You will mess them up, I promise you. That's okay. Take a do over. Come back and say to your kid, you know what? I said that wrong. I want to try again. But it's really, really critical to know that there are information resources out there for them that compete with you. And if you want to be the source of information, it's up to you to do it.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:31:39
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's up to you to do it. I think that's a really important point. If you're not having the conversation lightly, someone else is in some way, shape or form. Better that you do it, that you be the source because we owe it to our kids and to ourselves to do better. When talking about things like their bodies, the way they're changing what's on their minds. And yes, it might be uncomfortable. It might be awkward even, but it's okay. That's what chasing life is all about doing our best every day, even when it's not easy. But in the hope and the belief that it will make a difference. Because it really does. Chasing life is a production of CNN audio.

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;With its measles outbreak spreading to two additional states, Texas is on track to becoming the cause of a national epidemic if it doesn’t start vaccinating more people, according to public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Measles, a highly contagious disease that was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, has made a resurgence in West Texas communities, jumping hundreds of miles to the northern border of the Panhandle and East Texas, and invading bordering states of New Mexico and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Based on the rapid spread of cases statewide — more than 200 over 50 days — public health officials predict that it could take Texas a year to contain the spread. With cases continuously rising and the rest of the country’s unvaccinated population at the outbreak’s mercy, Texas must create stricter quarantine requirements, increase the vaccine rate, and improve contact tracing to address this measles epidemic before it becomes a nationwide problem, warn infectious disease experts and officials in other states.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“This demonstrates that this (vaccine exemption) policy puts the community, the county, and surrounding states at risk because of how contagious this disease is,” said Glenn Fennelly, a &lt;a href="https://ttpelpaso.com/providers/Glenn_Fennelly.aspx"&gt;specialist&lt;/a&gt; in pediatric infectious diseases and chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Texas Tech University. “We are running the risk of threatening global stability.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/article&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The measles outbreak — the largest in the state in 30 years — has spread from two cases in late January to more than 270 cases and now includes 11 counties, most of them in the rural South Plains region.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;So far this year, there have been more than 300 cases of measles confirmed across 15 states, as of March 13. The Texas outbreak, which makes up the bulk of those cases, is only linked to cases in New Mexico and Oklahoma, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;where state officials&lt;/a&gt; said this month that someone associated with the Texas outbreak was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Last month, Texas officials reported that an unvaccinated, otherwise healthy school-aged child died from measles, the first death from the virus in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;This month, New Mexico officials said an unvaccinated adult in Lea County, about 50 miles away from the outbreak’s epicenter of Gaines County, who died had tested positive for measles. Officials are still confirming whether the cause of death was measles, according to the New Mexico Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“This is a very multi-jurisdictional outbreak with three states involved and about seven or eight different local health departments, in addition to some areas where the state serves as the local health department. There are a lot of moving parts,” said Katherine Wells, director of public health for the City of Lubbock, during a Tuesday meeting of the Big Cities Health Coalition, a national organization for large metropolitan health departments.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Most of Texas’ measles cases are in unvaccinated school-aged children and are concentrated in the Mennonite community in Gaines County, which traditionally has low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Wells said efforts to increase the vaccination rates in Gaines County, which is about 70 miles from Lubbock, and the surrounding region have been slow as trust in the government has seemingly reached an all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We are seeing, just like the rest of Americans, this community has seen a lot of stories about vaccines causing autism, and that is leading to a lot of this vaccine hesitancy, not religion,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/18/texas-covid-pandemic-readiness/"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; led to the politicization of vaccines and overall weariness to health mandates like quarantines and masks. Public health officials are now battling misinformation and public resistance to measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Wells said because the state can’t stop people from traveling, she fully expects this outbreak to last a year, and the surrounding states and the nation should prepare themselves for a potential spread.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Measles is going to find those pockets of unvaccinated individuals, and with the number of cases and ability for people to travel, there is that risk of it entering other unvaccinated pockets anywhere in the United States right now,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="fe694c3c-564d-4104-a4e7-fe40f473f343" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Fennelly was living in New York in the 1990s when pamphlets started getting passed around the Hebrew community warning against the unfound dangers of the measles vaccine. Soon, the vaccine refusal rate began to climb, and an outbreak started filling hospitals with sick infants.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Now, decades later, Fennelly is watching the same series of events play out in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“This could have been predicted. There have been steady rates of increased personal belief exemptions over the last several years leading to pockets of under-vaccination across the state,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In the West Texas region, misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials, and fear of government authority overruling family autonomy have reigned supreme, creating the pockets that measles infiltrated this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;However, this is not just a South Plains problem but a statewide issue as vaccine exemptions continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have several pockets of population that have high unvaccinated groups. We sent out a letter to public and private school districts with low vaccination rates explaining the situation and asking them to update their children’s shots,” said Phil Huang, director and health authority for Dallas County Health and Human Services, during the Big Cities Health Coalition meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/school"&gt;requires children and students to obtain vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to attend schools, child care centers, and college. However, individuals can claim they are exempt if they are in the military, have a religious or personal belief that goes against getting immunized, or if a health provider determines it is not safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Since 2018, the number of requests to the Texas Department of State Health Services for an exemption form has doubled from 45,900 to more than 93,000 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7245a2.htm"&gt;Data&lt;/a&gt; suggests that vaccine exemptions and those living in areas with higher vaccine exemption rates for measles and pertussis are at increased risk of contracting these diseases. The authors of this data collection concluded that “geographic pockets of vaccine exemptions pose a risk to the whole community.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Fennelly said the hurdles to obtaining exemptions are easy to clear, leading to an increasing number of people refusing the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State lawmakers this session have filed more than a &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/27/texas-legislature-vaccine-mandate-bills/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20those%20who%20want%20to,must%20get%20the%20affidavit%20notarized."&gt;dozen bills&lt;/a&gt; that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We don’t have the capacity in Texas to deal with so many sick children if this continues to spread. We are already at our limit with seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Our doctors are at their limit,” Fennelly said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Simbo Ige, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, had to deal with a &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/may/cdph-press-release-05-30-2024.html"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in her city a year ago, with 64 individuals testing positive, 57 of whom were associated with a shelter. She said the quickest way they controlled the outbreak was quickly administering more than 30,000 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A Chicago Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7319a2.htm?s_cid=mm7319a2_w"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; projected a high probability of an outbreak of more than 100 cases without the city’s rapid intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It required a lot of education and messaging because people wanted the answer to why I need to get vaccinated. We started listing out the reasons — parents won’t be able to go to work, kids can’t go to school, and even worse, kids can get sick and die,” Ige said. “It’s 2025. We shouldn’t be having children dying from measles in this day and age. We have the tools. We just have to amplify the message.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;New Mexico’s public health officials started spreading awareness of vaccinations immediately after they learned Texas had its first measles case and before New Mexico got its first case.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We started setting up clinics and getting the ball rolling,” Jimmy Masters, the southeast region director for the New Mexico Department of Health, said. “Let's see what we can do to get people in the doors and vaccinated beforehand.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Nearly 9,000 New Mexicans have received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine shots between Feb. 1 and March 10. During that same time period last year, officials vaccinated 5,342 people.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas has held multiple vaccination clinics in the outbreak area, but according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, only 350 doses have been administered.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;New Mexico has also emphasized its &lt;a href="https://vaxview.doh.nm.gov/"&gt;Vaxview&lt;/a&gt; website that keeps track of residents' immunizations, allowing concerned people to check within seconds if they need a shot. Texas has a vaccine tracking program known as ImmTrac2, but it’s an opt-in program that doesn’t have most adult records. If someone doesn’t opt in by age 26, their records will not be retained.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We told people to contact us to ensure their vaccine status is up to date,” Masters said. “If they aren’t sure, just call the health office so we can find out for them. And if they don’t have their records updated for the vaccine, then we can ask them to come in and take advantage of the clinics or come in as walk-ins.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Because of this, most of Lea County is considered immunized, Masters said, so public health officials in New Mexico don’t view the outbreak as rapidly evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Back in Texas, the opposite is playing out. Advice from public health officials is seemingly ignored, and vaccine efforts are struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We need to have a consistent message from all levels. We need to reinforce the message that vaccines are safe and vaccines are how you prevent this, and we have concerns when other messages dilute this message,” Huang said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services officials are also encouraging people to vaccinate, but whether people will listen is out of the agency’s control.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The only way to stop the virus from spreading is to get more people immunized. We are …providing education about the severe complications associated with measles infection, and directing them to locations where they can get vaccinated,” said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the state health agency.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Fennelly said the main difference between Lea County and Gaines County is the public acceptance of the vaccine and public health in general. He said if Texas wants to improve, there should be studies on why people are so hesitant to accept vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We need to be asking why Gaines County? What are the concerns, and how do we, the health profession and public health officials, most effectively confront and allay those fears,” he said. “People shouldn’t be more afraid of the vaccine than the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="cc2eec3a-9c95-4a5c-93e5-7164b52bc116" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Obstacles to quarantining and contact tracing &lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A person with measles visits a friend, another visits kids at a college, and the other has friends over. Public health departments in West Texas are trying to trace the spread of measles, since other than strongly suggesting people quarantine, there’s nothing more local officials can do to prevent infected individuals from traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We shouldn’t be surprised in this kind of environment that we will have more cases,” said David Lakey, the vice chancellor for health affairs and the chief medical officer at the University of Texas System. “I think we need to work with individuals to ensure they stay home during an event like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State lawmakers have stripped control from cities and counties from implementing mandates, such as closing businesses and schools. While some of these laws apply only to COVID-19, public health experts say it has created an environment where state health officials can only offer suggestions to Texans with little enforcement, allowing measles to continue to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The state of Texas is taking it seriously and trying to balance how they approach this while respecting the laws of the state and also people’s freedoms,” Lakey said. “They are doing it while also making sure that we are doing everything it can to identify people, provide vaccines, isolate individuals, and take all the other steps to address an event like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;With young children particularly vulnerable to the disease, Lakey said hospitals must screen people entering hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Wells said there have been a couple of women who gave birth at a Lubbock hospital who were infected with measles or were recently exposed to it, and babies six months old or younger have needed treatment with immunoglobulin because of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“That’s really why measles is so scary. It’s so communicable, and it’s so easy to enter some of the very vulnerable areas where babies don’t have those vaccinations yet,” she said. “That’s going to be day cares, schools, hospitals, pediatricians offices, and we’re seeing those cases more and more as this outbreak continues.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;This potential spread makes contact tracing necessary, but Wells said it is one of their region's most significant challenges besides testing. While a laboratory set up in Lubbock has cut down wait times for tests results from 72 hours to one day, Wells said rural Texas doesn’t have the staff to track the travel of more than 270 people.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases, both because we’re still seeing spread and also because we have increased testing capacity, so more people are getting tested,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;New Mexico has a lead investigator for contact tracing who interviews the patients, gathers medical records, establishes a point of contact, and organizes vaccinations for those who were potentially exposed to prevent spread.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While West Texas officials try to follow the same policies, the health care system is decentralized, meaning the contact tracing is done by the local health authority first, and then, if necessary, the state gets involved and possibly, assistance from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Chris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said while the state is not necessarily struggling to contact trace, he acknowledges the extra manpower it requires.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“That also depends on the individuals talking with us and sharing that information. So that can be difficult, particularly when dealing with a more insular community. It can be difficult to make inroads, and that is why the local process is important,” Van Deusen said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Experts say that as travel season ramps up and if Texas can’t seem to stop the spread, states nationwide should prepare themselves for what may come.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The message to health departments is be ready, and schools need to think about this and government officials because this really does have the potential to grow beyond these three states,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

It took them all day to dig the holes, then cart over all the chicken carcasses in a skid steer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They buried all the bodies, along with thousands of dollars of feed and eggs, as the USDA had instructed them to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;MariKate wept inside her N-95 mask.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1551-7d4a3d.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1551-7d4a3d.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1551-7d4a3d.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1551-7d4a3d.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1551-7d4a3d.jpg" alt="Bird flu farm."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Marty Thomas in a barn on his farm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Jim Vondruska for NBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That day, a car had pulled up to the farm, and one of their regular customers got out, hoping to pick up fresh eggs. Still dressed in her hazmat suit, MariKate explained what had happened. He immediately handed her all the cash in his wallet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Then the messages started pouring in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Praying for you guys in this time of struggle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“All your dental friends are rooting for this to be all fixed up as quickly as possible!!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Donations to their GoFundMe campaign have swelled since word got out — as have orders for their online farmers market, the main source of their remaining revenue. They've been moved by the outpouring of support from their customers and community. But Kakadoodle Farm is still in financial peril. They’re considering applying for a private loan to keep the farm afloat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re at the bottom of our barrel,” Marty said. “If this doesn’t work, we’re out our entire life savings.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1552-d3924b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1552-d3924b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1552-d3924b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1552-d3924b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-bird-flu-ch-1552-d3924b.jpg" alt="Bird flu farm."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Egg cartons and shipping materials sit in a warehouse at Kakadoodle farm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Jim Vondruska for NBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What they keep telling themselves: They’ve weathered other disasters on the farm  — and somehow found a way to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There was the barn that burned down because of a faulty extension cord. The bacterial infection that tore through their flock, cratering egg production. There were endless mishaps and mistakes they made as they expanded their operation, battling mites and frozen water lines and the aftermath of tornados, scouring YouTube and turning to more seasoned farmers for answers.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s happened again and again and again,” Marty said. “This is crazy, what we’re doing. Like — we don’t know this world at all.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;And the next time, he and MariKate will be better prepared. They want to renovate their coops to keep wild birds out of the feed, while still giving the chickens space to roam. They’ll make sure to keep their farm shoes on the farm, to help reduce the spread of disease.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Because bird flu isn’t leaving America any time soon. Just three weeks ago, Marty and MariKate got a call from another local farmer who suspected he had a bird flu outbreak. He agonized over whether to call the USDA. His father begged him not to, warning that the agency would come and slaughter all of their birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“All I can tell you is what we did,” MariKate told him before she hung up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The farmer made the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNbURsTTY5UWdHLTdRa1FlMU9EV3pRdV9ITGNHeEp5a3Rpb3d0RXNyWF91REhtWXlaeE1ZRkxyNFdNNE1iTnBmcVFCRzllMWpJSEVWanBuMEtmb0pxMVNMN1BBQl8tVy1FcXlDUTl0dVFub2ZpY1dzTXppcWZqdkNoXzVzQQ</guid></item><item><title>I didn't think I was well enough to do daily yoga until I tried this app that's designed with people like me in mind - Fit and Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTFBRRTBBQXYwZFkyMTdaaTdQcVZsaTJYRnpjZDRXNks4VUdYaXZmLVlZUFd2RzFpQUFrdWNMcWNzVFZIcEJHcWpnWklKTDd6M3hqUUVZdUxVUE4tb29TOXRGLWVfczlncHBveUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health professionals often recommend yoga to help with chronic pain, poor mental health and limited mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve had an on-and-off relationship with yoga, enjoying it when I had the time but struggling to commit to a daily practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when I was diagnosed with an energy-limiting illness last year and my usual exercise routine became impossible to maintain, I found myself craving some sort of gentle movement that could help to lift my spirits without depleting my energy levels for days or weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter, yoga teacher Sophia Drozd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drozd is the founder of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Yoga for Pain (Y4P) app&lt;/a&gt; ($9.99/£7.99 a month, seven-day free trial available) and is on a mission to make the practice more accessible for people with chronic illness. Drozd herself has multiple chronic pain conditions, which means that she appreciates first-hand just how tough it can be to get up and move some days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've actually lived with pain for about 15 years,” she says. “I was a yoga teacher already, and I had extensive knowledge of yoga of poses within different styles and breathwork techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through those years, yoga has been a big tool for me in managing pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-UAyrECxxnnuVRTngMHs2vF" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-UAyrECxxnnuVRTngMHs2vF slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite that experience, Drozd explains that it can be difficult to practice traditional yoga when you are living with a disability, but wanted to share how she had used it to help her so it could do the same for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yoga can help to build strength as well as flexibility, which can release tension in muscles and joints” says Drozd. “It can then help to reduce stress which can make you more accepting of your condition. It can help regulate your mood, help to reduce inflammation through movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga requires a degree of focus, which can feel a lot when you experience brain fog, but this can help to improve brain function which subsequently can help us to manage continued pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The breathwork of yoga can help us to regulate the sensations of pain and improve our sleep quality encouraging our bodies to find a sense of calmness and relaxation,” adds Drozd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then meditation, which is another one of the eight limbs of yoga, can contribute to the cognitive reframing abilities helping us to observe and accept our pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After chatting with Drozd, I promised her I would commit to a daily practice. Here's what I found using the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-s-easy-to-find-something-that-suits-your-situation"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s easy to find something that suits your situation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app is laid out in a way that helps you locate what will work for you. In the yoga for pain section I found classes designed for people with my condition, but you can also search by body part (so yoga for hip pain, or yoga for knee pain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or if you want to just do meditation, breathwork or yoga from a chair, there are sections dedicated to these formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my condition, I have to rest in the middle of my work day, sometimes more than once, and I can wake up again feeling groggy and unrefreshed. The Y4P app features a short 10-minute practice that includes gentle stretching. It feels great but doesn’t make me sore for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also tried a bed yoga session and a class on yoga for fatigue—both of which were around 30 minutes long and led by Drozd. I enjoyed these and will do them again, but I kept coming back to the 10-minute practice after I nap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-speaks-the-language-of-chronic-illness"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It speaks the language of chronic illness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with chronic conditions or disabilities use the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory" target="_blank" data-url="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;spoon metaphor&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate their capacity, which can be depleted by physical, emotional, intellectual or social exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, having a shower might cost someone one or two spoons on a good day, and five or six spoons on a bad day. On bad days, you ration your spoons for the important stuff, like going to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spoon theory has been incorporated into the Y4P app using spoon emojis next to class titles to indicate how taxing a class will be. A 30-minute flow where you stand up and sit down multiple times will cost the maximum of three spoons—only attempt on a good day—but a seated breathwork or short bed yoga practice might only cost one spoon and can be slotted into even the most low-energy days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think that with already limited energy, you’d want to spend it on the most fun and fulfilling things possible—eating chocolate, fussing over a pet, or cuddling a partner, but when you're only spending spoons on those things, self-care tends to slip off the radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drozd explains that even a gentle &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/a-yoga-teacher-recommends-doing-this-one-thing-before-you-start-your-day-to-tune-into-your-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/a-yoga-teacher-recommends-doing-this-one-thing-before-you-start-your-day-to-tune-into-your-body"&gt;10-minute breathwork practice&lt;/a&gt; when you wake up encourages you to check in with your body, breathe consciously and mentally check in with yourself, which is a basic, but valuable act of self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process can help you to better understand your condition, your pain and your capacity, and how these things may vary from day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-drozd-is-a-compassionate-friendly-host"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Drozd is a compassionate, friendly host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may just be my personality, but sometimes I just do not gel with online instructors. Drozd is like me—someone with a chronic illness who lives each day within a limited window of energy—and I took to her style of teaching. She gives options for most movements and always encourages users to take it slowly and only do what is comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, when yoga is recommended by health professionals, it’s given some sort of mystical quality and you find yourself thinking “oh, maybe this will fix me.” Drozd and I have both experienced this, but she was extremely clear: yoga will not fix your condition, but it may help you to live with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-UAyrECxxnnuVRTngMHs2vF-9Y01Nc6YbQOlbVh0PaPf5WSIRN4BeiqG" class="slice-container person-wrapper person-UAyrECxxnnuVRTngMHs2vF-9Y01Nc6YbQOlbVh0PaPf5WSIRN4BeiqG slice-container-person"&gt;&lt;div class="person person--separator person--strapline"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__heading"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline-inline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__name-socials"&gt;&lt;span class="person__name"&gt;Sophia Drozd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nav class="button-social-group person__social-buttons" aria-labelledby="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;&lt;p id="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;Social Links Navigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.instagram.com/yogaforpainapp/%20" target="_blank" aria-label="INSTAGRAM"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon_instagram" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;circle cx="12" cy="12" fill="#de3073" r="12"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M18.958 9.116a5.121 5.121 0 00-.336-1.708 3.557 3.557 0 00-2.044-2.044 5.12 5.12 0 00-1.694-.322C14.142 5.014 13.89 5 12 5s-2.142.014-2.884.042a5.213 5.213 0 00-1.708.322 3.665 3.665 0 00-2.044 2.044 5.213 5.213 0 00-.322 1.708C5.014 9.858 5 10.1 5 12s.014 2.142.042 2.884a5.12 5.12 0 00.322 1.694 3.44 3.44 0 00.812 1.246 3.4 3.4 0 001.232.8 5.175 5.175 0 001.708.336c.742.028.98.042 2.884.042s2.142-.014 2.884-.042a5.082 5.082 0 001.694-.336 3.456 3.456 0 002.044-2.044 5.006 5.006 0 00.336-1.694C18.986 14.142 19 13.9 19 12s-.014-2.142-.042-2.884zM17.7 14.828a3.946 3.946 0 01-.252 1.3 2.189 2.189 0 01-.518.8 2.165 2.165 0 01-.8.532 4.641 4.641 0 01-1.3.238c-.742.028-.966.042-2.828.042s-2.1-.014-2.828-.042a3.837 3.837 0 01-1.3-.252A2.258 2.258 0 016.54 16.13a3.91 3.91 0 01-.238-1.3c-.028-.742-.042-.966-.042-2.828s.014-2.086.042-2.828a3.787 3.787 0 01.238-1.3A2.445 2.445 0 017.87 6.54a3.856 3.856 0 011.3-.238c.742-.028.952-.042 2.828-.042s2.086.014 2.828.042a3.787 3.787 0 011.3.238 2.445 2.445 0 011.33 1.33 4.641 4.641 0 01.238 1.3c.027.742.042.952.042 2.828s-.011 2.088-.036 2.83zM12 8.4a3.6 3.6 0 103.6 3.6A3.6 3.6 0 0012 8.4zm.181 5.929a2.338 2.338 0 01-.362-4.662 2.43 2.43 0 01.362 0 2.338 2.338 0 010 4.662zm3.557-6.909a.84.84 0 11-.84.84.84.84 0 01.84-.838z" fill="#fff"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="WEBSITE"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon-website" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 1000 1000"&gt;&lt;path d="M1000 500A501 501 0 0 0 503 0h-6A501 501 0 0 0 0 500c0 275 223 499 498 500h4a501 501 0 0 0 498-500zM529 936V765h133c-31 90-79 154-133 171zM337 765h134v171c-54-17-101-81-134-171zM61 539h176a899 899 0 0 0 22 167H110a439 439 0 0 1-49-166zM471 64v191H331c31-101 82-173 140-191zm199 191H529V64c58 18 109 90 140 191zm270 226H763c-1-59-7-115-18-167h155a438 438 0 0 1 40 167zm-235 0H529V314h156a857 857 0 0 1 19 167zM471 314v167H296a859 859 0 0 1 19-167h156zM237 481H60a438 438 0 0 1 41-167h154a921 921 0 0 0-18 167zm59 58h175v167H320a837 837 0 0 1-24-166zm233 167V539h175a831 831 0 0 1-24 167H529zm234-166h176a436 436 0 0 1-49 166H741a893 893 0 0 0 22-166zm104-285H731c-20-68-47-126-81-169a443 443 0 0 1 217 169zM350 86c-33 43-61 101-81 169H133A443 443 0 0 1 350 86zM148 765h127c20 59 45 110 75 150a442 442 0 0 1-202-150zm502 150c30-39 56-91 75-150h127a442 442 0 0 1-202 150z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="person__bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophia Drozd is the owner and founder of &lt;a href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Yoga for Pain&lt;/a&gt;  (Y4P), and is a qualified yoga teacher, lifelong practitioner and chronic pain warrior.

			&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/tiktok-statistics/"&gt;1.8 billion people&lt;/a&gt; log into TikTok at least once a month, spending an average of 95 minutes per day being engaged, entertained, and even educated by the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are phenomenal numbers, but a new study shows the platform isn't the most reliable source for information, particularly when it comes to health conditions like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="155775" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada found that of the top 100 most-viewed TikTok videos tagged for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;) content, fewer than half matched the professional diagnostic criteria for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos – which had collectively racked up nearly half a billion views in total – were largely based on personal experience and opinion. They often missed the nuances of ADHD, such as the way symptoms can differ between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155778" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155778" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud.jpg" alt="Word cloud" class="wp-image-155778 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud-416x415.jpg 416w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud-600x599.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155778" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at hashtags related to ADHD posts. (Karasavva et al., &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TikTok can be an incredible tool for raising awareness and reducing stigma, but it also has a downside," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/03/adhd-misinformation-on-tiktok/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; UBC clinical psychologist Vasileia Karasavva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Anecdotes and personal experiences are powerful, but when they lack context, they can lead to misunderstandings about ADHD and mental health in general."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also ran an experiment using the top 100's five most accurate and five least accurate videos, as judged by clinical psychologists. These 10 clips were then shown to 843 undergraduates taking an introductory psychology course, who were asked to rate them based on their perceived educational value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the best five videos scored an average of 3.6 from psychologists for accuracy, they only got a score of 2.8 from the students. The worst five videos for accuracy scored 1.1 from psychologists, but 2.3 from students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications are clear: there's a significant gap between expert opinions on TikTok's ADHD videos and those of casual viewers. Such potential for misinformation could interfere with the public's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adhd-diagnoses-keep-rising-higher-this-is-why-its-happening"&gt;understanding of the condition&lt;/a&gt;, which could affect how many are diagnosed and treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings highlight a discrepancy between mental health professionals and young adults regarding the psychoeducational value of ADHD content on TikTok," &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Addressing this is crucial to improving access to treatment and enhancing support for those with ADHD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that students who viewed more ADHD content in general were more likely to share it with others, and that they were more likely to think that ADHD is more common &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-finds-adhd-is-more-prevalent-in-adults-than-we-realized"&gt;than it actually is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content creators on TikTok are rewarded for attracting views rather than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-analyzed-what-tiktok-says-about-medical-tests-and-got-a-nasty-shock"&gt;providing accurate information&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers point out, and they'd also like to see more expert content from health professionals shared on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't anti-TikTok, and acknowledge its value in building community and reaching young people. But they're also encouraging TikTok viewers to look for other, more reputable sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some young adults turn to TikTok because of access barriers, or negative experiences they have had with mental health professionals," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/03/adhd-misinformation-on-tiktok/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Amori Mikami, a professor of psychology at UBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic diseases related to inflammation are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regularly walking can help tame inflammation by reducing inflammatory markers in the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for 150 minutes of walking per week, divided into one or two sessions daily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The silver lining? You can reduce inflammation by lacing up your sneakers. Keep reading to find our 7-day walking plan designed to reduce inflammation. We’ll also chat with certified personal trainers who explain how walking can help and how much you need to walk for the best results.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-your-walking-plan"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Your Walking Plan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts agree the ultimate goal is to work (or, shall we say, &lt;em&gt;walk&lt;/em&gt;) your way up to at least 150 minutes each week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And consistency is key to achieving this goal. It’s far better to do a 10-minute walk 3 to 4 times a week than overexert yourself with one long, hard one-hour long and then skip the rest of the week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, you can also break down your walking sessions into shorter intervals throughout the day. For example, you could walk for 15 minutes in the morning and another 15 minutes in the evening instead of aiming for one 30-minute block. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you feel more confident and seasoned, you can slowly dial up the duration of each walk by adding 5 minutes daily. You can also challenge yourself by walking up some hills or increasing the incline on a treadmill to make it steeper. Another way to spice things up is interval walking: alternate between 5 minutes of brisk walking and 5 minutes at a slower pace, then repeat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For any beginners new to walking for exercise, here’s an example of what your 7-day walking plan could look like: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday: &lt;/strong&gt;15-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday: &lt;/strong&gt;Rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday: &lt;/strong&gt;20-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday: &lt;/strong&gt;Rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday: &lt;/strong&gt;15-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday: &lt;/strong&gt;Rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday: &lt;/strong&gt;20-Minute Walk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-walking-helps-reduce-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Walking Helps Reduce Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking doesn’t just help you meet your daily step count; it can also lead to better blood flow and circulation throughout the body. “As more oxygen and nutrients are carried to working tissues, this helps repair tissues, reducing damage caused by inflammation,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/elizabeth-shaw/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Shaw, M.S., RDN, CPT&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and certified personal trainer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Increased blood flow serves multiple functions. It helps deliver nutrients to where they are needed while also removing pro-inflammatory cells. “When circulation is increased, it helps to remove toxins and waste from the body,” &lt;a href="https://www.pennwest.edu/about/directory/hatton_m.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Melissa A. Hatton, M.S., NASM-CPT&lt;/a&gt;, faculty member in the Exercise, Health and Sport Sciences department at Pennsylvania Western University,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with improved circulation, walking also helps lower inflammatory markers, explains Shaw. In particular, it reduces CRP (C-reactive protein), a marker of inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hatton notes that exercise, such as walking, helps to reduce excess body fat, which &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7901433/surprising-link-between-chronic-inflammation-obesity/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;is linked to chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that individuals with more active lifestyles experience significant reductions in inflammatory markers compared to those who are sedentary.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet another reason to break out your sneakers!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise also triggers the release of anti-inflammatory cells. &lt;a href="https://www.nasm.org/darlene-marshall-sme?srsltid=AfmBOorIUEYaDoW3-fHDZdwA5sk7ldD7LWnvc7hsUgj5MW9RJr-tKWAl" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Darlene Marshall, NASM-CWC, CPT&lt;/a&gt;, a certified personal trainer, explains that when our muscles contract, they release cytokines—proteins with anti-inflammatory benefits that circulate throughout the body after exercise, helping to tame inflammation. Although you can’t see them, they are busy floating in our blood after exercise and working to reduce inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For individuals with metabolic diseases like diabetes and high cholesterol, Marshall points out that movement, like walking, helps lower inflammation by utilizing excess resources, such as high blood sugar. Elevated blood sugar levels can increase inflammation, but walking regularly can help tackle this issue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 12-week study on postmenopausal women with obesity found that those who followed a consistent walking plan experienced a significant decrease in not only inflammatory markers but also weight and body fat percentage. This further proves that walking helps lower inflammation and supports the rest of the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And if you’re looking for a way to boost your mood, walking can also make you smile. Marshall explains that releasing endorphins can make you more sensitive to positive emotions, helping you feel happier. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-to-walk-for-lower-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Much to Walk for Lower Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Any and all forms and amounts of walking will be a step in the right direction for reducing inflammation and improving your health,” says Shaw. She points to research showing that adults over 60 years old who walked between 6,000 to 8,000 steps per day saw positive health changes, while adults under 60 who logged between 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day also experienced health improvements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Showing any amount of walking at any age can really help. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Intensity matters, too. Marshall recommends aiming for moderate or high-intensity levels because that’s when cytokine activation occurs. She says, “That's going to be a different pace for each of us, but generally, you can walk like you're late for an important appointment.” That means you should be breathing heavily but still hold a conversation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research confirms you have to be consistent with exercise to see a decrease in inflammation, as only regular, moderate and intense physical activity has anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, excessive exercise can do the opposite and lead to heightened levels of inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This means that, technically, you can walk too much. Hatton warns, “You can also overdo it with a walking plan, which can actually cause inflammation. Anytime you overexert or overtrain, the body reacts to the stressor.” She recommends walking at a moderate pace, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/homemade-electrolyte-drink-8785287" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;staying hydrated&lt;/a&gt; and listening to your body. If you are tired or sore, take a day off to recover. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you start to feel bold or adventurous, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013593/health-benefits-of-walking-backward/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walking backwards may provide even greater benefits&lt;/a&gt;. “A recent study showed that walking backwards on a treadmill, also known as ‘retro-walking,’ demonstrated more favorable results for lowering cardiovascular disease risk, including markers for inflammation,” notes Shaw.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, she notes that this may not be everyone, and that’s okay, so stick to what you feel comfortable with. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you walk forwards or backwards, maintaining a consistent walking plan at a moderate pace is the best action plan for walking to reduce inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To lower inflammation, take more steps. Research shows that regular walking can help reduce inflammatory markers, improve circulation, support metabolic health, improve body composition and even boost your mood. The key is to be consistent and walk your way up to meeting 150 minutes per week.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

with mental health, admitting that she suffered from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-81273eb0-05f3-11f0-a3b7-971a21fb6f21"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), for years and battled postpartum depression after giving birth.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the day of the shocking deaths, Harshman had clonazepam in her system, which is prescribed to help panic disorders and epilepsy. It can be recognized under the brand name Klonopin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clonazepam is a sedative and has side effects including paranoia, suicidal ideation, and impairment of judgement, coordination, and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ketamine is an anesthetic which can have hallucinogenic effects. The drug is only &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-1f0a9a00-05ea-11f0-91d7-7d511c582b9a"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; approved as an anesthetic, but not to treat mental health disorders, according to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/what-to-know-about-ketamine"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the day she died, Harshman  called emergency services and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14395903/Call-Traneyelle-Harshman-shooting-daughters.html"&gt;reported that her daughters had been shot&lt;/a&gt; and were dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tranyelle Harshman, 32, killed herself and her four children on February 10 in Wyoming &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cliff Harshman told local news that even though he was angry with his wife for taking their children from them, he still grieved her and loved her &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harshman and her four children Brailey, 9, Brooke, who was almost three, and Jordan, 2 died after sustaining gunshot wounds &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harshman then said that she was planning on doing the same to herself, and hung up the phone despite pleas from the 911 operator to stay on the line until emergency crews arrived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom told the dispatcher that she couldn't stay on the line and said it was 'too late,' according to the Big Horn County Sheriff's Office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within minutes, law enforcement responded to the scene and found Brooke and Jordan dead in their cribs while Brailey was found with a gunshot wound in a downstairs bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Olivia and Harshman were transported to a local hospital with signs of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harshman died two days later in hospital. Olivia, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14404017/Wyoming-girl-Olivia-Blackmer-dies-mother-Tranyelle-Harsshman-murder-suicide.html"&gt;died at a hospital in Salt Lake City,&lt;/a&gt; Utah, five days after the incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traynelle's husband, Cliff, was on a business trip and the girls were home sick with the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olivia died at a hospital in Salt Lake City after her sister, Brailey, was found dead in their home &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olivia's biological father and stepmom announced her death in an update on an online fundraiser days after the murder-suicide &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The shocking events occurred in the small town of Byron, Wyoming &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their toxicology reports, as first reviewed by local news outlet, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/03/20/byron-mom-in-murder-suicide-had-depression-anxiety-meds-in-system/"&gt;Cowboy State Daily&lt;/a&gt;, revealed that the children who died at the scene had 'unusual large amounts of Propanolol – beta-blocker – and Diphenhydramine – antihistamine which causes drowsiness – in their systems.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diphenhydramine is a key ingredient in the brand-name allergy drug, Benadryl. Propranolol is a prescription beta-blocker that can treat high blood pressure, chest pain, migraines, and tremors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug can result in side effects such as slow or uneven heartbeats, lightheadedness, trouble breathing, sudden weakness, depression, heart problems, or low blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear why the girls were on the medications, but Cliff told Cowboy State Daily that his wife's chemical mental health treatments were her last hope to cope with her mental health struggles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm bitter that this has had to continue to be a thorn in my side, when I need to just… grieve my family's loss,' Cliff said on the questions he's been pestered with since the tragedy rocked his family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also want people to understand that this isn't a chance to demonize different therapies. This works for a lot of different people,' he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This was her last grasp at the rope, if you will, to hang on.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Law enforcement responded to the home just minutes after Harshman called 911 and reported her daughters deaths &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olivia and Brailey, the two oldest daughters who died in the murder-suicide, pictured with their biological father Quinn Blackmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cliff told the outlet that he went to visit his wife in the hospital after the murder-suicide and prayed for the strength to forgive  her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that he was working on accepting that his family was gone and wanted to focus on grieving instead of defending them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cliff was the biological father of the two younger girls, Brooke and Jordan, but raised Olivia and Brailey for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Olivia and Brailey's biological father, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14405313/heartbroken-dad-breaks-silence-daughter-died-mother-murder-suicide.html"&gt;Quinn Blackmer, and his wife Katelynn announced&lt;/a&gt; that Olivia had died after fighting in the hospital for days after she was shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Olivia is with her sisters now. She gained her angel wings yesterday at 3.49pm.

It's a chemical imbalance,' he said. 'And it can be exacerbated by trying to fix it with medication.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cliff added that her violent actions were 'so out of character' and what happened was 'unbelievable.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As angry as I may be with her, I still love her - and I still lost her as well,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOOUlnY044V3RxeHVMNDBEUUhzZGExTGs1WGNPRTdlVTFiQXk4WmF2emEzNjFHTDZhdmJLaGRFZHp5eXhIQWp0TkpyRTJnMjZPb2Qyd2FTR0NyQVAtVFpuT0RWMkRnTXBzX1AtdVNMNE5ZR3dGbm8yeXFsX2JobWM2VHMxaXJBUHNoZUVaZEk2aFR4Y3JZdS1qcGdUajZtWlhiQnRpQmxUYnMtc0p6VEVz0gG0AUFVX3lxTE0tdzJET2ozWWpYbjFfU1hHN2lrbmNoWnk5ZEFENkxBMW92akk4dHRqbFlQUkhZbVBvQ3dPMy1JdkxCV3l2N1lZMnlPSzZ1SHJKRGoybWJTX0kwTXF1bjFYdi16Q2RuSDUxMTJsWHZFaW1TNTBkcnQ1cDlHUFV3dFpJakFIbWdaZnBwTmdZTHZmb0pDbmUxQTF1UDZTbmxDb1hKS1ZZOVVJREVkZVlUcW5ick9wWQ</guid></item><item><title>Trump’s Former Surgeon General Tears Into RFK Jr. for Fostering Vaccine Skepticism - The Daily Beast</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPZ3drMEFQQThPdWtvMWZ3aVJuQTZZTlE2em9Xelp5eFU5RG4xUnhPbG5zZWttelFSVUdwNHVFMXB4LTZpUm55VUVUMXhUUVlPSW9VZGREcHdqdjhLLVZkMnAzSE5sVFZiNjZ3cTNNY3pUX1hZbk8xTGdYb1Fya1lDWG40MGhzYjJXdlhlSDYtZHlYa1dDNExHVE1sdGhmcllqUEU2MlJjdXNoV2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack b-right-rail__main-interior-item" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="c-overline b-overline TDB" href="/category/politics/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/category/politics/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Politics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h1 class="b-headline"&gt;Trump‚Äôs Former Surgeon General Tears Into RFK Jr. for Fostering Vaccine Skepticism &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="c-heading b-subheadline"&gt;In an op-ed, Dr. Jerome Adams noted that Kennedy‚Äôs legacy will depend more on what he does about the measles outbreak now than his words in the past.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack b-double-chain" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;div class="c-grid b-double-chain__children-grid"&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack b-double-chain__child-item" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;div class="Article-byline--single-author"&gt;&lt;p class="PublicationTime"&gt;&lt;time class="PublicationTime__pub-time" datetime="March 20, 2025 at 9:31PM EDT"&gt;&lt;span class="PublicationTime__date-label"&gt;Published¬†&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="PublicationTime__date"&gt;Mar. 20 2025¬†&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="PublicationTime__time"&gt;9:31PM EDT¬†&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="b-lead-art"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="c0fDzxgXCT3g12H" data-fusion-collection="chains" data-fusion-type="article-body" data-fusion-message="Could not render component [chains:article-body]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Short-author-bio-tips"&gt;&lt;p class="Short-author-bio-tips__tip"&gt;Got a tip?

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Texas parents of an unvaccinated 6-year-old girl who died from measles Feb. 26 told the anti-vaccine organization Children’s Health Defense this week that the experience did not convince them that vaccination against measles was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“She says they would still say ‘Don’t do the shots,’ ” an unidentified translator for the parents said. “They think it’s not as bad as the media is making it out to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The couple, members of a Mennonite community in Gaines County, spoke on camera in both English and Low German to CHD Executive Director Polly Tommey and CHD Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It was her time on Earth,” the translator said the parents told her. “They believe she’s better off where she is now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We would absolutely not take the MMR,” the mother said in English, referring to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination children typically receive before attending school. She said her stance on vaccination has not changed after her daughter’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The measles wasn’t that bad. They got over it pretty quickly,” the mother said of her other four surviving children who were treated with castor oil and inhaled steroids and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The couple told CHD that their daughter had measles for days when she became tired and the girl’s labored breathing prompted the couple to take her to Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock. There, the girl was intubated and died a few days later. The other children came down with measles after their sister died.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The&lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/breaking-news-parents-of-child-in-texas-measles-outbreak-death/"&gt; parents’ interview&lt;/a&gt; was posted on the website of Children’s Health Defense, an organization founded in 2007 by Robert F.

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The deceased girl’s father insisted that measles helps build up a person’s immune system. “Also the measles are good for the body for the people,” the father said, explaining “You get an infection out.”&lt;/p&gt;

He was sentenced to six years but has already served two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crimes were first flagged in the summer of 2022 at the doctor’s office along Houston’s East Freeway. According to &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599087-118974688pdf/"&gt;court documents, obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; the practice had a five-gallon water dispenser in a shared common area that was used by staff and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 30 2022 an employee, known as M.A., noticed "the water she got from the water dispenser had a funny taste and smell to it," according to the complaint. She later told police she began to bring her own water bottle rather than drink “sour” water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employee later "noticed her water from her personal water bottle that she brought from the store smelled nasty," the documents stated, adding that the woman had decided to throw away the bottle rather than investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the office did not have security cameras, the woman then bought a small camera online and attached it to her computer. She also bought a large bottle of water and put it in view of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 ildOYm"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/20/22/34/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-6-27-47-PM.png" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/20/22/34/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-6-27-47-PM.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/20/22/34/Screenshot-2025-03-20-at-6-27-47-PM.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lucio Catarino Diaz, who worked as a janitor at a Houston medical practice, was sentenced to six years in jail on Tuesday after pleading guilty to a charge of aggravated assault with deadly weapon, namely, his urine.

Lucio Diaz was not phased, he was not nervous—he had done this before—and it had now become just a part of his daily ‘cleaning’ ritual.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diaz confessed to the crimes when questioned by police, according to the complaint, saying he "did it because he knew [the employee] would drink it the next day." He added that he had a “sickness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman later had several &lt;a href="/topic/std"&gt;STD&lt;/a&gt; tests done which came back positive for Herpes simplex virus type 1, something she had never previously tested positive for, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests on Diaz revealed he was positive for the same virus, as well as chlamydia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the discovery, multiple other women working at the medical practice found they had also contracted &lt;a href="/topic/stds"&gt;STDs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep these Frozen Lemon-Ginger-Turmeric Shots on hand for when you start to feel sick.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They’re packed with immune-supporting ingredients like lemon, ginger, turmeric and black pepper.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Freeze them for up to 3 months and dilute with 8 ounces of warm water before drinking. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When the seasons change, I’m on high alert for any illnesses that might be going around. When my body starts to adjust from cold to warmer weather (or vice versa), feeling a tickle in my throat or lingering sniffles is pretty common. While there isn’t one food that can promise to prevent a cold or flu, certain &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-supplements-for-immune-health-8781386" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrients&lt;/a&gt; like vitamin C, zinc and antioxidants can help keep your immune system in tip-top shape. This helps it fight off any illnesses that enter your body and can help you recover more quickly. That’s why I always make a big batch of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8018333/frozen-lemon-ginger-turmeric-shots/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Frozen Lemon-Ginger-Turmeric Shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They’re packed with immune-supporting ingredients and can easily be portioned and stored in the freezer so you can thaw just what you need when you need it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These Frozen Lemon-Ginger-Turmeric Shots contain just a handful of ingredients you might already have on hand. Most of the liquid in the recipe comes from lemon juice, which is packed with vitamin C—one serving provides about 15% of your daily needs of around 75 milligrams per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-vitamin-c-8546809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, a potent antioxidant, has been shown to help reduce the duration and severity of the common cold.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Rich in Anti-Inflammatory Compounds &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These shots also contain a healthy dose of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7561449/health-benefits-of-turmeric-ginger/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ginger and turmeric&lt;/a&gt;, a combination that can provide potent anti-inflammatory benefits. Research has found that antioxidants in ginger and turmeric can work together to help reduce inflammation in the body and lower disease risk for acute conditions like the common cold and chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A little bit of honey helps mellow the flavors and lightly sweeten the shots. This provides added benefits as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-honey-8707139" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; contains anti-inflammatory properties and has been found to help reduce throat irritation, especially when sick.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Then, a splash of water and black pepper finish it off. While ⅛ of a teaspoon of black pepper might not sound like a lot, don’t skip it! Even this small amount of black pepper can help your body &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-ingredient-to-combine-with-turmeric-11694659" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;absorb up to 2,000% more&lt;/a&gt; of turmeric’s anti-inflammatory compound called curcumin.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only are these shots packed with nourishing ingredients, but they’re also really easy to make. All in all, they come together in just 10 minutes. Simply add all the ingredients into a blender and process until smooth, which only takes about one minute. Then, strain the juice through a fine mesh strainer and discard the fibrous solids that are left behind. After this, all that’s left is to portion the juice into ice cube trays and freeze it. Since I typically make a double batch, I’ll save some in a jar in the fridge to take as a shot in the mornings for the coming days. Storing the rest in the freezer makes it easy to grab a frozen cube and top it with hot water for a refreshing and flavorful sip whenever I need it. They last for up to 3 months in the fridge. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While I love these shots, their flavor can be pretty strong—even if they’re diluted with water. If you prefer something more subtle, there are many other ways to add immune-supporting foods like lemons, ginger and turmeric into your routine. These ingredients are super versatile, so don’t be afraid to get creative. Here are some ideas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Toss and roast your favorite veggies roasted cauliflowerwith turmeric for a delicious side—and don’t forget to add a dash of black pepper, too &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simmer a batch of a soothing soup with ginger, which can also be made ahead and frozen for future sick days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep a jar of a lemon dressing in your fridge to make it easier (and more delicious) to up your intake of nutrient-dense leafy greens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I always make a big batch of our Frozen Lemon-Ginger-Turmeric Shots to store for whenever I feel a scratchy throat or stuffy nose coming on. They’re packed with immune-supporting ingredients like lemon, ginger and turmeric that can help lower inflammation, shorten the cold duration and reduce illness severity. While these shots are quick and easy to make, they aren’t the only way to reap the benefits of these nourishing foods. You can add lemon, ginger and turmeric to sweet and savory dishes you already make and love—just remember to pair turmeric with a dash of black pepper to improve absorption&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gottlieb was the FDA’s leader during Trump’s first administration and offered his thoughts on a wide range of challenges facing health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at STAT’s Breakthrough Summit East on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, Gottlieb called out Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-skepticism-on-view-in-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;response to the measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. He said it lacked a full-throated push to vaccinate and instead focused on parental choice and using vitamin A as a treatment. Studies show that vitamin A can improve the chances of surviving measles, but some experts have questioned whether it has benefits in children who are not malnourished.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That is extremely damaging because the impression it leaves to consumers is that there is a treatment available for measles, when in fact there is not,” Gottlieb said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Obama administration, also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/20/tom-frieden-texas-measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine-public-health/"&gt;criticized Kennedy’s response to the measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; during the event. He warned that Kennedy’s wavering on vaccines combined with the Trump administration’s moves to slash federal health programs could turn the outbreak into a public health disaster.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Gottlieb also questioned whether the administration’s recently unveiled plan, dubbed “Operation Stork Speed,” to improve American infant formula will address underlying issues. Kennedy met with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/18/hhs-fda-operation-stork-speed-review-infant-formula-safety-nutrition/"&gt;leading infant formula makers&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday to press them on nutrient composition, regulatory standards for European companies, and the formula supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You see some of the dialogue coming out of this, and you’d think they discovered fire,” Gottlieb said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Operation Stork Speed plan — a riff on Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s Covid-19 vaccine development plan — involves requiring better formula labels, increasing testing for heavy metals, allowing more importation of foreign formula, and conducting health outcomes research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leaders in the Make America Healthy Again movement have &lt;a href="https://x.com/calleymeans/status/1902062870495388034" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;praised European infant formula&lt;/a&gt;, but Gottlieb noted that regulatory standards are higher for formula makers in the United States. He questioned whether emulating the European system would improve the U.S. market. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also the question of whether Kennedy will be able to strengthen the infant formula market given the FDA food center’s lack of resources. The center has always lacked money, and may also lose staff as &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/18/fda-foods-division-jim-jones-interview/"&gt;workers reel from the administration’s probationary cuts&lt;/a&gt;. Gottlieb compared the potential sluggishness of the administration’s plan to the slow flight speed of a stork.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In some respects it was aptly named Project Stork Speed, because a stork travels 15 miles an hour, versus Operation Warp Speed, which goes a lot faster,” Gottlieb said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Marty Makary, President Trump’s pick to run the FDA, is scheduled for a confirmation vote in the Senate next week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers are grappling with the Trump administration’s tariff war. Gottlieb, who is on the board of Pfizer, called for less drastic measures to encourage companies to bring their &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/26/eli-lilly-drug-manufacturing-investment/"&gt;manufacturing back to the United States&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully there’s some kind of more deliberate, thoughtful policy put in place where you create incentives and structures that allow the manufacturing to come back here,” Gottlieb said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gottlieb also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/20/h5n1-bird-flu-egg-prices-former-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-biosecurity-vaccines-new-normal/"&gt;referenced a First Opinion&lt;/a&gt; article he published in STAT on Thursday, which questioned Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; to allow bird flu to spread freely through flocks. Preventing flocks from being infected in the first place is key, he said, which will tamp down the skyrocketing egg prices that Americans have seen.&lt;/p&gt;

Usually, one to four days after the early symptoms, a red rash appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Symptoms typically develop 10 to 14 days after exposure but can develop as soon as seven days and as long as 21 days after exposure. A person with measles is contagious, beginning four days before the rash appears until four days after the rash begins. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;People are generally considered immune to measles if they are up to date on measles vaccination, have had a laboratory confirm they either had measles during their lifetime or are immune to measles, or were born before 1957. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Virginia residents with questions about their potential exposure can call the Virginia Department of Health at 804-363-2704 or email epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Washington, D.C. residents with questions about their potential exposure can call DC Health at 844-493-2652 or email &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:DOH.Epi@dc.gov"&gt;&lt;span&gt;DOH.Epi@dc.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends all travelers get &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/plan-for-travel.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;fully vaccinated against measles before traveling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to an international destination. Traditionally, the measles vaccine is given around a child’s first birthday. However, a family with a child under one year of age and traveling internationally can contact their health care provider to discuss their travel destination and appropriate vaccines to get before the trip. In specific instances, the measles vaccine can be given as early as six months old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles cases occur sporadically in Maryland, with one case of measles identified in Maryland earlier this year, one in 2024, one in 2023, and no cases from 2020-2022.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Media Availability: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Lucia Donatelli, Chief of the Center for Immunization, Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Outbreak Response Bureau, will be available for media questions today at 6:30 p.m. To participate, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://meet.google.com/xug-irsu-jyb?authuser=0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;join the Google Meeting &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;or call 1 413-276-6895‬ PIN: 851 558 648‬#‬.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;###&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Maryland Department of Health is dedicated to protecting and improving the health and safety of all Marylanders through disease prevention, access to care, quality management and community engagement. ​​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Follow for more updates: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://facebook.com/MDHealthDept"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://instagram.com/MDHealthDept"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/MDHealthDept"&gt;&lt;span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXKdJm2OCrtqxeu2uirCrw"&gt;&lt;span&gt;YouTube&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://linkedin.com/company/Maryland-Department-of-Health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Maryland Department of Health</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 21:37:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxNekNIempZcjhWMF9INWpCZS1ha01EcEtwTG1tSUYtdDliZkNIRnA4ZE12ZkUtSzJ0dnpuWGtDbGNrLUlyaXhvd0ZibWtneXVCNE1iZ0NkLXRXZmV5QlpMM2h0LUxPaHRldi05WHF4cEtFNXZUaDVCdFZiTEtjOHlCUXFfUi1pUkZzYXkzQWZRekE1dGNfbjNMaVFSYlZnMzZseEtzNEF2UUtUcUFoNjgzRlhnWGNCaF9RNldlWFhFSXZobnFrWFNXbXFjY09udw</guid></item><item><title>Ohio reports first measles case of 2025 - 10TV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxNdHV4LVduOVozOXZYZ0hnTnV5dG4wTVlJT0MxNU1oXzU0ZjA5RmpWTW5jVGFyQVpzYmZNUzlRejNSV2Y5eUdSUXBqeTg4RVpvRXF5S05GaUs3UjhISGFqN2JzaUJHOHhYYTAzbEpkTEMwSTFJQkpwdXVBU3hLZ1VGT1NIa3pMUzVRMWR2bVdldFVCbFA3a3BUbG9ZenZvc2tHeF9iNWFWVWFvcERjYXB1OFZXOWtNR1RxRXZ3SHgxVm1vWFZVU3hOQk0tdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;State health officials confirm its first measles case of the year in an unvaccinated adult from Ashtabula County.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASHTABULA COUNTY, Ohio — State health officials reported the first measles case in Ohio this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health said the person infected was an adult in Ashtabula County who was unvaccinated and had contact with someone who had recently traveled outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODH is working with the Ashtabula County Health Department to follow up on potential exposures.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we now have a measles case in Ohio adds emphasis to the importance of being fully vaccinated,” said ODH Director Bruce Vanderhoff. “This disease can be very serious, but it is preventable. I strongly encourage you to protect yourselves and your children by getting vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio had 90 cases of measles in 2022, after an outbreak in central Ohio resulted in 85 cases. The state had one measles case in 2023 and seven in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is extremely contagious and can spread to others through coughing and sneezing. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people are not protected against the disease, 9 out of 10 people who are exposed will become ill, ODH said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are up to date on the measles vaccine have a low risk of illness.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends all children get two doses of the vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be given to adults born after 1957 who are not vaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) is reporting the state's first measles case of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the ODH, the infected adult is from &lt;a href="/local"&gt;Ashtabula County&lt;/a&gt;. The person was unvaccinated "and had contact with someone who had recently traveled internationally."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we now have a measles case in Ohio adds emphasis to the importance of being fully vaccinated,” said ODH Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff in a release. “This disease can be very serious, but it is preventable. I strongly encourage you to protect yourselves and your children by getting vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials say they are now working with the Ashtabula County Health Department "to follow up on potential exposures and to promote opportunities for vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is extremely contagious and can spread to others through coughing and sneezing. It can be brought back to the United States, and Ohio, by individuals who travel. If people are not protected against the disease, 9 out of 10 people who are exposed will become ill," the ODH explained in a release. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first case of measles in Ohio in 2025 comes amid ongoing outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico. By comparison, there were a total of seven cases last year, one in 2023, and 90 cases in 2022 spurred by an outbreak in Central Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/article/news/health/ohio-school-vaccination-rates-decline/95-0933492c-92df-4447-b588-d9375f32e5f6"&gt;During a briefing earlier this week,&lt;/a&gt; ODH officials announced that the state's school vaccination rates have fallen to 85.4% for the 2024-25 school year, down from 86.2% last year and well below the national average of 92.7%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals emphasize that the two-dose regimen of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) — administered between 12-15 months and again between ages 4 and 6 — is 97% effective against measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends all children get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. The MMR vaccine can also be given to adults born after 1957 who are not vaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study found that low waist-to-hip ratio may be associated with better brain connectivity in older age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers also found that a high waist-to-hip ratio may negatively affect 25% of the white matter tracts in your brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White matter helps your brain communicate with itself and your spinal cord.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keeping our minds sharp as we age is essential on many levels, from helping us preserve our independence to increasing longevity and quality of life. And since changes in the brain start decades before symptoms of dementia show up, it’s never too early to begin healthy brain habits.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some of those habits might include keeping an eye on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-habits-dementia-study-11695904" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, getting &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alzheimers-exercise-study-11691515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;in some exercise&lt;/a&gt; and eating a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/polyphenols-reduce-cognitive-decline-11680121" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;wide variety of fruits and veggies&lt;/a&gt;. Maintaining a healthy weight can be pretty important as well. Some studies have linked obesity with worse brain health, though much of that research has used BMI to determine the weight class of study participants, and BMI is not always the most accurate measure of weight. For example, someone can have a lot of lean mass—including muscle and bone—and low body fat, yet rank in the “obese” BMI category. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this reason, European researchers decided to use waist-to-hip ratio instead of BMI since abdominal fat &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/could-the-body-roundness-index-replace-bmi-8658684" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;may be a more accurate measure&lt;/a&gt; of disease risk. These researchers wanted to know if diet quality and abdominal fat during middle age are associated with cognitive decline at older ages. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here’s what they found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from a long-term study called the Whitehall II Study at University College London. This study began in 1985 and looked at the relationship between socioeconomic factors, work conditions and health outcomes in people who worked in British public service. Over 10,000 participants were followed for 30 years, which were broken up into 13 study “waves.” Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was measured during five of those waves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this study, researchers also used brain MRI scan data from a random subset of the larger Whitehall II Study. That study was called the Whitehall II Imaging Substudy at the University of Oxford, and it included 775 participants who received functional brain MRI scans. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study at hand consists of two cohorts. The first, called the diet cohort, was made up of 506 participants, 79% of them male. Data was drawn from three waves of the Whitehall II study, and the average participant age was 48 at the first wave used and 70 when the MRI scans were performed. The second cohort for this study was called the WHR cohort. It was made up of 657 participants, 80% of them male, with similar ages to the diet cohort on average.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Diet quality was determined via food frequency questionnaires given during three of the waves. After data was collected, participants’ diet quality was assigned a score using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010—generally, the higher the number, the healthier the diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Abdominal adiposity was determined using the WHR, which was estimated by measuring hip and waist circumferences and then dividing the waist circumference by the hip circumference. The lower the ratio, the less abdominal adiposity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also examined participants’ brain scans. The MRI brain scans were functional—as opposed to still, snapshot images of the brain—allowing the researchers to examine blood flow in the brain, which is a measure of brain function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To assess diet, researchers used self-reported food questionnaires, which may have errors if participants misremember or misreport their eating habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participants in this study were largely middle-aged and predominantly male. Though researchers adjusted for differences in sex, these findings may be less applicable for women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The participants in this study were also generally healthier than the U.K. population at large, researchers note, and the participants were mostly white and British, which means these findings may be limited in their generalizability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Statistical analysis suggests that higher diet quality and lower WHR during the study period were associated with better structural and functional connectivity in the brain later in life. In addition, a lower WHR during midlife was associated with better working memory and executive function later in life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In contrast, higher abdominal fat in midlife was associated with worse cognitive performance in older age, including fluency, episodic memory, working memory and executive function. This was, in part, evidenced by higher widespread diffusivity of white matter in the brain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; White matter is brain tissue composed of nerve fibers that facilitate rapid transmission of electrical signals between different brain regions and the spinal cord. For your brain health, you definitely want to keep your white matter intact. These researchers found that, on average, about 25% of white matter tracts were negatively affected in people with higher WHR during midlife.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study has suggested that compared to imbalanced diets—like high-protein, low-fiber diets—a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-importance-of-a-balanced-diet-for-brain-health-8641834" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy, balanced diet that includes a variety of foods&lt;/a&gt; may be better for brain health. This current study seems to support this notion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290813/mind-diet-best-foods-to-eat-to-keep-your-brain-young/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;—a fusion of the Mediterranean and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938379/the-1-diet-to-lower-high-blood-pressure-according-to-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;DASH diets&lt;/a&gt;—focuses on brain-healthy nutrients, including antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein and healthy fats. And there’s a bonus: the MIND diet is also good for your heart and can be great &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mind-diet-diabetes-study-11696569" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;for people with diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The MIND diet is flexible and can be tailored to your preferences. To get started, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-7-day-cognitive-health-meal-plan-11685540" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Simple 7-Day Cognitive Health Meal Plan&lt;/a&gt;. Created by a registered dietitian, it includes meals and snacks for seven days—all the recipes you need to feel inspired in the kitchen. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other than diet, there are activities you can engage in that will support your brain. Meditating and practicing yoga—or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/number-one-habit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8722637" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;moving your body more&lt;/a&gt; through other activities—can reduce stress and protect your brain. Ditto for getting plenty of quality sleep. Since the brain is at least 73% water, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7948091/why-drinking-water-all-day-long-is-not-the-best-way-to-stay-hydrated/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;staying well-hydrated&lt;/a&gt; is an easy way to diffuse brain fog and improve concentration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep your brain active by learning new skills, reading and challenging it with various types of puzzles. And spend time with loved ones, since loneliness has been associated with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/loneliness-dementia-risk-study-8733921" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;an increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that a healthy, balanced diet and an optimal amount of abdominal fat during the mid-life years may lead to a healthier brain later in life. As with any research, more needs to be done to investigate the connection further.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many factors influence abdominal fat, including diet, exercise, stress and sleep. If you feel like you may need a whole-health overhaul, start with small changes to your routines that you can build on over time. A little less screen time before bed so you can sleep better could be a great first step, or maybe you could aim to try a new healthy recipe each week to get more veggies and healthy fats and proteins into your day. Sometimes the little changes can reap big rewards down the road.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found strong links between placental DNA methylation and conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that genetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders may be active before birth. Understanding these early epigenetic changes could lead to targeted interventions and personalized prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placental influence:&lt;/strong&gt; DNA methylation in the placenta affects genes linked to psychiatric disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early intervention potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifying risks in prenatal stages may allow for prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodevelopmental origins:&lt;/strong&gt; Schizophrenia and other disorders may start before birth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of the Basque Country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study that involved 28 researchers from 18 institutions across Europe and the United States highlights the placenta as a key element in neuropsychiatric development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The research has demonstrated that specific epigenetic modifications in the placenta, particularly DNA methylation, can influence the expression of genes associated with psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108213"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The discovery that genetic risk may be linked to placental DNA methylation opens new avenues for preventing and treating psychiatric disorders. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that genetic risk may already manifest during the prenatal stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic modifications are chemical changes in DNA and its associated proteins that regulate gene activity without altering their sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most studied modifications is DNA methylation, a process in which methyl groups—small molecules composed of one carbon and three hydrogen atoms—are added to specific regions of the DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism, essential for development, environmental adaptation, and disease predisposition, is influenced by genetics and responds to factors such as diet, stress, and exposure to pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study results indicate that schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression disorder are the neuropsychiatric disorders most strongly linked to DNA methylation in the placenta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism, show some potentially causal associations, although to a lesser extent, while no visible effects were found in other analyzed pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings reinforce the hypothesis that schizophrenia and other disorders have a neurodevelopmental origin and that the placenta plays a fundamental role in this process,” explains Dr. Fernandez-Jimenez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Personalized Medicine and Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery that genetic risk may be linked to placental DNA methylation opens new avenues for preventing and treating psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we could identify risk factors at the prenatal stage, we could intervene before symptoms appear, adjusting treatments or designing personalized preventive strategies,” adds Cilleros-Portet, who completed her PhD at UPV/EHU last summer and is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also underscores the importance of understanding where and when each genetic factor acts in pathology, since this could impact therapeutic decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not all genes associated with a disorder should be treated directly; some may have acted in an earlier developmental stages and may not be actionable in adulthood,” concludes Fernandez-Jimenez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research represents a significant advance in understanding the biological basis of neuropsychiatric disorders and opens new lines of investigation for early detection, as well as for the development of more effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted at IRLab (UPV/EHU and Biobizkaia). IRLab is a multidisciplinary research group coordinated by Dr. José Ramón Bilbao, full professor at UPV/EHU and researcher at Biobizkaia. Dr. Fernandez-Jimenez has been working in this laboratory for years, developing her own research lines in the epigenomics of celiac disease and, more recently, of the placenta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, Dr. Cilleros-Portet completed her doctoral thesis on placental DNA methylation and its impact on health in this laboratory, under the supervision of Fernandez-Jimenez and Bilbao. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the prestigious Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and schizophrenia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2e4f5c4f405a544f004c4b475a474f446e4b465b004b5b5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Arantza Beitia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ehu.eus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of the Basque Country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Arantza Beitia – University of the Basque Country&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image:&lt;/strong&gt; The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57760-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Potentially causal associations between placental DNA methylation and schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;” by Fernandez-Jimenez et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potentially causal associations between placental DNA methylation and schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence supports the role of the placenta in neurodevelopment and in the onset of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, mQTL and iQTL maps have proven useful in understanding relationships between SNPs and GWAS that are not captured by eQTL. In this context, we propose that part of the genetic predisposition to complex neuropsychiatric disorders acts through placental DNA methylation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We construct a public placental &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-mQTL database including 214,830 CpG sites calculated in 368 fetal placenta DNA samples from the INMA project, and run cell type-, gestational age- and sex-imQTL models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We combine these data with summary statistics of GWAS on ten neuropsychiatric disorders using summary-based Mendelian randomization and colocalization. We also evaluate the influence of identified DNA methylation sites on placental gene expression in the RICHS cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We find that placental &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-mQTLs are enriched in placenta-specific active chromatin regions, and establish that part of the genetic burden for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder confers risk through placental DNA methylation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential causality of several of the observed associations is reinforced by secondary association signals identified in conditional analyses, the involvement of cell type-imQTLs, and the correlation of identified DNA methylation sites with the expression levels of relevant genes in the placenta.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 20:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5INktiYjNCbTloR3NrTkl1ZHRJLVUzY0tlT3FHR2psZ2ZIeXJrQ3FCekoyTHozTnowZnF3a1NsUWdyYWhCaXhwaEcyNGpsbzlTOFBFLXdfcTRnVVJ2dmNyN2RvRFI4TjdmYmhnNjVpVDJCM2FseUE</guid></item><item><title>Artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes directly linked to heart attacks and strokes - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQalRBSXAwTFd6U2ljYTI1X1dqOS1DM0NidC1vSlNpMS0tc3c2WGZnUUszenNGNWg4b0k4OEhkc1ZWa1E5SHRieTFKMjNWUHgxZ19ITEZ1b0lnbHA5czlPQjlHcEplTHhoQ1MyaFpQOXVSbGF6anh3Rk15TnB1QjNwMklscnlaZ1ZaRF9Fd2R3SWtTdXM2dXRkVTRMVW9oQ1pTV1FuZmtza18?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar substitutes and artificial sweeteners show up in many diets and “low-calorie” products, promoted as a way to help people enjoy sweet flavors without the usual calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks pick them to help manage weight goals or reduce daily sugar intake. Others look for sugar-free snacks to limit changes in blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their popularity reflects a common desire to avoid sugar-related pitfalls. Yet concerns continue to surface about how these substances may affect overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior and corresponding author Stanley Hazen, M.D., Ph.D., from Cleveland Clinic’s &lt;a href="https://www.lerner.ccf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lerner Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, addresses these questions through new findings on certain sugar substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sugar-substitutes-the-basics"&gt;Sugar substitutes – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many forms of “sugar substitutes,” also known as artificial sweeteners. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mice-fed-artificial-sweetener-exhibit-alarming-health-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aspartame&lt;/a&gt;, sucralose, saccharin, and sugar alcohols such as erythritol and xylitol are available in various items labeled “diet” or “low-calorie.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They offer sweetness in small amounts because many are far sweeter than table sugar. Saccharin, for example, is typically hundreds of times sweeter than sugar, so only a tiny dose is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also appeal to those trying to manage their weight. Some people believe replacing sugar with these products helps them avoid extra calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others rely on them to reduce sudden spikes in blood sugar, which can be appealing to individuals with conditions like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several regulatory agencies consider many of these sugar substitutes acceptable at certain daily intake levels. Some &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/most-baby-food-isnt-nutritious-despite-what-the-label-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nutritional guidelines&lt;/a&gt; encourage their use when people need to cut back on simple carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many professional societies and clinicians routinely recommend that people at high &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/young-cannabis-users-face-higher-heart-attack-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular risk&lt;/a&gt; – those with obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome – consume foods that contain sugar substitutes rather than sugar,” Dr. Hazen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight the importance of further long-term clinical studies to assess the cardiovascular safety of erythritol and other sugar substitutes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these products are labeled “&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Generally Recognized as Safe&lt;/a&gt;,” the way individuals actually consume them raises questions that may not have been fully covered in past research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts would like to see broader and longer studies on potential effects beyond weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sugar-substitute-called-erythritol"&gt;Sugar substitute called Erythritol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, scientists wondered if all sugar substitutes behave the same way in the body. A Cleveland Clinic team looked at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythritol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;erythritol&lt;/a&gt;, a sugar alcohol found in sugarless items such as gum and certain snack products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an intervention study with healthy volunteers, they noticed a pattern that prompted follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research raises some concerns that a standard serving of an erythritol-sweetened food or beverage may acutely stimulate a direct clot-forming effect,” said study co-author W. H. Wilson Tang, M.D., research director for Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation Medicine at &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Erythritol and other sugar alcohols commonly used as sugar substitutes should be evaluated for potential long-term health effects, especially when such effects are not seen with glucose itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xylitol-also-has-issues"&gt;Xylitol also has issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those same scientists saw that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/holiday-dangers-keeping-your-pets-safe-on-easter-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;xylitol&lt;/a&gt;, another sugar alcohol, displayed similar behavior in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with higher xylitol levels appeared to have an increased likelihood of experiencing serious cardiac-related events over the following few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since these trends emerged in people already facing cardiovascular issues, the question has become whether these substances could pose added risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some products are marketed as keto-friendly, which has further boosted the reputation of sugar alcohols for those on very &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/low-carb-diets-have-more-nutritional-value-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;low-carb diets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While xylitol and erythritol fit the profile for reduced-calorie sweetening, this latest work suggests that they merit deeper research to see how they interact with blood and overall heart function in various groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-sweetness-and-safety"&gt;Balancing sweetness and safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the new data, there are suggestions for caution, particularly if a person has conditions linked to thrombosis or other cardiac complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel that choosing sugar-sweetened treats occasionally and in small amounts would be preferable to consuming drinks and foods sweetened with these sugar alcohols, especially for people at elevated risk of thrombosis, such as those with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sugary-drinks-linked-to-millions-of-diabetes-and-heart-disease-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome,” Dr. Hazen advises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular disease builds over time, and heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. We need to make sure the foods we eat aren’t hidden contributors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers often include sugar substitutes in a range of drinks and snacks. Some individuals like them simply because they believe they promote better control of caloric intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet researchers suggest that people who already have heart-related issues or metabolic conditions pay special attention to how often they rely on these sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason experts remain cautious is the fact that sweetener consumption can vary widely from person to person. Some drink several diet beverages a day or frequently snack on sugar-free treats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidelines about upper intake levels were developed when long-term &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular outcomes&lt;/a&gt; were less clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, these studies may prompt new evaluations of how all sugar alcohols behave in those at high risk for blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether someone chooses sugar alternatives for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/weight-loss-drugs-could-save-an-enormous-number-of-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;weight management&lt;/a&gt; or portion control, these details introduce fresh reasons to check in with a healthcare provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual plan that considers medical history and personal risk factors can be valuable when figuring out how often to use products sweetened with substances like erythritol or xylitol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-sugar-substitutes"&gt;What’s next for sugar substitutes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opinions differ about whether these sugar substitutes fully serve their intended purpose. Some see them as helpful for limiting sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others consider them a source of unintended problems when used regularly, especially in people with a history of heart disease or metabolic disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new information continues to emerge, discussions may lead to fresh guidelines or label requirements that highlight potential cardiovascular considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, moderate consumption and a balanced diet remain popular approaches. Artificial sweeteners may fit into certain meal plans, but the recent research from Cleveland Clinic invites extra thought about possible drawbacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading labels and talking with trusted healthcare professionals can help people figure out the best mix of sweet options in daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That awareness may allow many to avoid unwelcome surprises while still keeping their favorite flavors on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.124.321019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 20:46:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQalRBSXAwTFd6U2ljYTI1X1dqOS1DM0NidC1vSlNpMS0tc3c2WGZnUUszenNGNWg4b0k4OEhkc1ZWa1E5SHRieTFKMjNWUHgxZ19ITEZ1b0lnbHA5czlPQjlHcEplTHhoQ1MyaFpQOXVSbGF6anh3Rk15TnB1QjNwMklscnlaZ1ZaRF9Fd2R3SWtTdXM2dXRkVTRMVW9oQ1pTV1FuZmtza18</guid></item><item><title>Tuolumne County confirms two measles cases, warns of exposure at high school and emergency room - Los Angeles Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3wFBVV95cUxOTWZZOHBUdkUxTzV5LW56SWxDNDlDenM2Y2xOM2RMX0RoM1Z0cFV3U2RLTDI3d2UyNjJLS2ctMHhFQjBmY2RWdm9hTGt2RWJNRGlSSGdRRnFORFpMMDMyZUlvWW9XNXlQM1MxcXZoY25nUVRzR2N1X3NmZHhQaXYtLXJoOWRtTUZlRzBYRXpOTUVEYllGUDRlVUN2TWMxMFF1S2hYTlpiWlRCWm1Da05WSVlaMHVuX0lLekhvellSNXlUUFRBWXhXX01wUTRMMHN2ZFRjYkQ4TDhQMWxjaUlz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-body font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 text-primary-text-color clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tuolumne County Public Health Department on Wednesday confirmed two measles cases a day after it opened an investigation into the possible infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said the cases involved an adult and a child under 18 who lived in the same household and had traveled internationally. It’s unclear whether they had been vaccinated against measles, a highly contagious and potentially deadly disease most often associated with a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-28/first-confirmed-measles-case-in-los-angeles-county-since-2015-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;high fever and rash&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the department said it was investigating the cases for measles and warned of potential exposure at Summerville High School in Tuolumne on March 10-11 and at Adventist Health Sonora Emergency Department on the evening of March 15 and morning of March 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Public health officials issued another update Thursday night warning those who visited the Sonora Sports and Fitness Center’s back gym, locker rooms, restrooms and back pool area on March 10 between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. of possible exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We understand that there may be a lot of questions and concerns. The investigation is still ongoing, and we will provide updates as they are available,” Michelle Jachetta, the county’s public health director, said in a Wednesday statement &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.tuolumnecounty.ca.gov/1293/Public-Health-Press-Releases" target="_blank"&gt;confirming the cases&lt;/a&gt;. “We want to remind the public that measles is a highly contagious disease and to take steps to protect yourself and your family by ensuring current vaccination status for measles, monitoring for symptoms, and staying home when you feel sick.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Merrill, superintendent of Summerville Union High School District, also issued a statement this week that saying the district “takes the health and safety of its students, staff and our community seriously” and that the school would work with public health officials “through the process of identifying any risk.” More than 430 students attend Summerville High School, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuolumne County’s cases come amid a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html" target="_blank"&gt;deadly measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that began in the southern Plains and Panhandle region of Texas in January and has since infected 279 people, making up the vast majority of more than &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;300 confirmed cases &lt;/a&gt;across 15 states so far this year. An unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-west-texas-death-rfk-41adc66641e4a56ce2b2677480031ab9" target="_blank"&gt;died from the disease in February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health reported Thursday that there have been at least &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;eight confirmed cases of measles &lt;/a&gt;in the state this year. They have not published the locations of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuolumne County reported some of the state’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/School/tk-12-reports.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;lower vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; in the 2023-24 school year, according to data published this week by the state public health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 89.8% of Tuolumne County kindergarten students were up to date on all their immunizations, compared with 93.7% of kindergartners statewide. And only 93.1% of kindergarten students had received both doses of their measles, mumps and rubella shots, substantially lower than the 96.2% statewide average. California typically publishes vaccination rates for kindergarten, first-grade and seventh-grade students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say a 95% vaccination rate, sometimes called “herd immunity,” is considered the gold standard of disease prevention. A slip of even 1 or 2 percentage points can create an opportunity for disease to spread, meaning that even if the overwhelming majority of children are vaccinated, it could still take only a few cases to spark an outbreak in an area where immunization rates have fallen below 95%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-19/california-school-vaccines-measles-immunity"&gt;reported a decline last year&lt;/a&gt; in the share of kindergarten students who were immunized against measles, despite strict laws that make it difficult for parents to skip shots for their children. That includes 16 counties where measles immunization had fallen below the herd immunity threshold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An  increase in vaccine hesitancy in recent years, coupled with widespread disinformation online and increasing political division, could make it even harder to encourage immunization, said former state Sen. Richard Pan, a Sacramento Democrat who wrote California’s vaccine laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We seem to be heading the wrong direction,” Pan said. “We’ve been feeling pretty comfortable, like ‘we’re OK.’ But we suddenly now prove to people, it’s not OK.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 20:40:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3wFBVV95cUxOTWZZOHBUdkUxTzV5LW56SWxDNDlDenM2Y2xOM2RMX0RoM1Z0cFV3U2RLTDI3d2UyNjJLS2ctMHhFQjBmY2RWdm9hTGt2RWJNRGlSSGdRRnFORFpMMDMyZUlvWW9XNXlQM1MxcXZoY25nUVRzR2N1X3NmZHhQaXYtLXJoOWRtTUZlRzBYRXpOTUVEYllGUDRlVUN2TWMxMFF1S2hYTlpiWlRCWm1Da05WSVlaMHVuX0lLekhvellSNXlUUFRBWXhXX01wUTRMMHN2ZFRjYkQ4TDhQMWxjaUlz</guid></item><item><title>Brain’s Memory Maps Constantly Evolve to Capture Changing Experiences - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE0zUFV5VVd1UWQzeWdOYzhqSk41RFpyU0hsaTJyc1M1LUlHU0JIem5yQmJMYXdoUF9EekhuWGhyQU4yQVFUUTFfNndncjFDejJnbVNUUzdLMkVKRWxRS0E0cGNsY0p4a012blJyVkdocV9WS1BDVFZMdjBTS0Z5dG8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that memory-related brain activity continues to shift even after learning, challenging traditional views of stable neural representations. Researchers analyzed hippocampal neurons in mice and found that their “place cells,” which encode spatial memory, subtly changed each time the mice revisited a familiar environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using computational modeling, the study showed that traditional Hebbian plasticity (neurons that fire together wire together) could not fully explain these shifts, while a newer model called Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) did. BTSP, triggered by calcium spikes in neurons, was found to be more influential in shaping how memories are recorded in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic memory maps:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain cells continuously update spatial memories rather than stabilizing them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New plasticity rule:&lt;/strong&gt; BTSP better explains shifting memory representations than traditional learning models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encoding experiences:&lt;/strong&gt; Place cells may capture subtle differences in time, environment, and context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As animals experience new things, the connections between neurons, called synapses, strengthen or weaken in response to events and the activity they cause in the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists believe that synaptic plasticity, as these changes are called, plays an important role in storing memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108209"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Although the research shows that hippocampal activity is much more dynamic during memory formation than previously thought, it’s still not clear what purpose these shifting representations could serve. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the rules governing when and how much synapses change are not well understood. The traditional view is that the more two neurons fire together, the stronger their connection becomes; when they fire separately, their connection weakens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from the University of Chicago on the hippocampus, a brain area essential for memory, suggests that this is not the whole story. Other rules of synaptic plasticity appear to have a bigger effect and better explain how brain activity continually reshapes the way memories are recorded in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterns of activity and their neuronal representations change a lot as an animal becomes more familiar with a new environment or experience. Surprisingly, those patterns keep evolving even once something is learned, albeit more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you go into a room, it’s new at first but it quickly becomes familiar to you every time you come back,” said Mark Sheffield, PhD, Associate Professor of Neurobiology and the Neuroscience Institute at UChicago and senior author of the new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, you might expect that neuronal activity representing that room would settle and become stable, but it continues to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These changes in representation, during learning and after, must be driven by synaptic plasticity, but what kind of plasticity exactly? It’s hard to know, because we don’t have the technology to measure that directly in behaving animals,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifting place cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for the discovery of “place cells”: neurons in the hippocampus that activate only when an animal is at a certain spot in a room, called the “place field.” Different neurons have their place fields at different locations in the room, covering the entire environment and forming what’s known as a cognitive map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Antoine Madar, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Sheffield’s lab, studied place cell activity recorded in the brains of mice as they scampered through different environments. The mice first ran through a familiar environment, then switched to an unfamiliar one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers expected to see the same patterns of activity when the mice were in a place they knew, and different patterns as they learned a new environment. Instead, they saw that the activity was slightly different every time, and reasoned that these changes reflected synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand what drives these constant changes in neuronal representations, Madar built a computational model of hippocampal neurons, and then applied different plasticity rules to see if they would make place cells behave in the same patterns seen in the mouse data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of the traditional “neurons that fire together wire together” rule, known as Hebbian &lt;em&gt;Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity&lt;/em&gt; (STDP), a different, non-Hebbian rule called &lt;em&gt;Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity&lt;/em&gt; (BTSP) best explained the shifting place field dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some changes in place cell activity were subtle; the cell fired in a slightly different location than the previous time. Others were more drastic, jumping to a completely different location. STDP could only explain the small gradual shifts, Madar said, but BTSP could explain the whole range of shifting trajectories, including the big nonlinear shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know a lot about the physiology that supports synaptic plasticity, but we usually don’t know how important those things are for learning,” Madar said. “Our study provides evidence that BTSP is more impactful than STDP in shaping hippocampal activity during familiarization.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTSP is a fairly recent discovery, so Madar said that comparing their data and models allowed them to learn a lot about this new plasticity rule. For instance, they knew that BSTP is triggered by large jumps in the amount of calcium inside cells, but they didn’t know how frequently these jumps happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research shows that while these jumps are rare, they occur more frequently when an animal is learning and forming new memories. The researchers also found that once a place field forms, the probability of these BTSP-triggering events follows a simple decaying pattern, with only slight variations across brain regions or familiarity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is enough to explain the awesome diversity in individual place field dynamics that we observed,” Madar said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encoding the entire experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the research shows that hippocampal activity is much more dynamic during memory formation than previously thought, it’s still not clear what purpose these shifting representations could serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Continually evolving neuronal representations could help the brain distinguish between similar memories that happened in the same place but at different times, a very important process to avoid pathological memory confusion, a hallmark of multiple neurological and cognitive disorders,” Madar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheffield starts to sound Proustian when considering this question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every time you come back into the room that you’re sitting in, you’re somehow able to track that you’re in the same room. But it’s a different day and a different time, right? You can never completely replicate an experience, and somehow the brain tracks all that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, one idea is that these dynamics in memory representations are encoding just that. They’re encoding slight changes in the experience, like maybe you have a coffee one time and later you have lunch in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These subtle differences in setting, odors, time — all these slight changes in experience could be encoded into the memory through the changes in these place fields. They’re not just encoding the environment; they’re encoding the entire experience that occurs there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study, “Synaptic Plasticity Rules Driving Representational Shifting in the Hippocampus,” was funded by the National Institutes of Health (DP2NS111657, F32MH126643), the Whitehall Foundation, the Searle Scholars Program and the Sloan Foundation.

BTSP-triggering events are rare, but more frequent during new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During exploration, their probability is dynamic—it decays after PF onset, but continually drives a population-level representational drift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our results show that BTSP occurs in CA3 but is less frequent and phenomenologically different than in CA1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, our study provides a new framework to understand how synaptic plasticity continuously shapes neuronal representations during learning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 20:38:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE0zUFV5VVd1UWQzeWdOYzhqSk41RFpyU0hsaTJyc1M1LUlHU0JIem5yQmJMYXdoUF9EekhuWGhyQU4yQVFUUTFfNndncjFDejJnbVNUUzdLMkVKRWxRS0E0cGNsY0p4a012blJyVkdocV9WS1BDVFZMdjBTS0Z5dG8</guid></item><item><title>CDC confirms D1.3 genotype in recent H5N1 case in Ohio - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOLXlEVjJuNUJoOXM5VTBDNUpkNWJmUU9DRVRpaFJLSHctQk9wd25QdlhYaHlEVkRPdEltMXhHYktwX3J5akVZSGVHOFZpZE9lOEZyZHg2X0QzTW1NWWlwVUZNc2VnV3gzTzlMVkhXSVdSUTFkaUNQVXVFMGtCV2tlRFpBcmxhTGFvOURDbHdxTnZJTzY3MjVVVjg4VEc4aUM2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-03192025.html"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; yesterday on scientific investigations related to H5N1 avian flu activity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said genetic sequencing had identified the D1.3 genotype in a sample from an Ohio poultry culler whose infection was reported in the middle of February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the CDC reported serology findings from the investigation into a January H5N1 infection in a San Francisco child whose exposure to the virus remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other developments, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) today announced new funding to battle avian flu in poultry, as its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed more H5N1 detections in poultry from four states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;First known illness involving D1.3 genotype&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early months of 2025, Ohio’s commercial poultry sector emerged as one of the worst affected by H5N1 outbreaks, and the poultry worker had prolonged contact with birds that had been sick. He was hospitalized with both respiratory and nonrespiratory symptoms. The patient had initially tested negative on upper-respiratory samples but was positive on lower respiratory tract sampling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC said sequencing shows the virus is a clade 2.3.4.4b virus of the D1.3 genotype, which like the D1.1 genotype descended from the A3 genotype that was introduced to North America in 2022 and has since reassorted with North American wild bird avian flu viruses. D1.1 has been circulating in wild birds and poultry and recently jumped to dairy cattle in Nevada and Arizona. It has also been implicated in a few human infections, two of them severe and one fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic analysis of the D1.3 virus didn’t identify any markers that would impact the effectiveness of antivirals or candidate vaccine viruses, the CDC said, adding that it did not see any changes that would allow the virus to more easily adapt to or spread among mammals. Efforts to isolate the live virus are still underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Serology in California probe rules out human-to-human spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another update, the CDC said its scientists have completed serology testing on blood samples from close contacts of a San Fransico child whose mild illness from an undetermined source was first announced in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child’s blood had antibodies to H5N1, but testing on samples from the child’s close contacts were negative for previous infection with the virus, suggesting that none of them were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are reassuring,” the CDC said, noting that so far, no human-to-human H5N1 transmission has been detected in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its report, the CDC also spotlighted two recently published ferret studies that found pre-existing antibodies from earlier infection with the 2009 H1N1 seasonal flu virus might provide some protection against H5N1. One of the two studies, published this week in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(24)00338-0/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Microbe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also found that the ferrets with previous exposure to H1N1 were less likely to pass the virus to animals in the same enclosure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study also found that ferrets with ocular exposure to the B3.13 genotype H5N1 virus developed severe and transmissible disease, similar to when they were infected by the respiratory route, which the CDC said supports the recommendation for wearing eye protection when exposed to infected or potentially infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;USDA announces funding for poultry avian flu measures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other H5N1 developments, the USDA today &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/usda-announces-next-steps-effort-support-fight-against-avian-influenza"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; up to $100 million in funding for projects to battle avian flu in poultry and reduce the price of eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three priority areas are novel therapeutics and improved diagnostics, research to better understand how the virus is introduced into poultry flocks and to inform biosecurity mitigation steps, and novel vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said it consulted with other federal health agencies in setting the funding opportunities. The USDA emphasized that no vaccines are currently authorized and that any decision to move forward with use will involve input from federal agencies, states, veterinarians, farmers, the public health system, and the American public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More poultry outbreaks in 4 states&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the USDA’s APHIS confirmed more H5N1 detections in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;poultry flocks&lt;/a&gt; from four states, including a layer pullet facility Indiana that has more than 1.3 million birds and a commercial duck breeding farm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the virus hit backyard flocks in Illinois, Kansas, and Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Tristan Yates has no doubt about her first memory, even if it is a little fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was about three and a half in Callaway Gardens in Georgia," she recalls, "just running around with my twin sister trying to pick up Easter eggs."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But she has zero memories before that, which is typical. This amnesia of our babyhood is pretty much the rule.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have memories from what happened earlier today and memories from what happened earlier last week and even from a few years ago," says &lt;a href="https://tristansyates.github.io/" target="_blank"&gt;Yates&lt;/a&gt;, who's a cognitive neuroscientist at Columbia University. "But all of us lack memories from our infancy."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Is that because we don't make memories when we're babies, or is there something else responsible? Now, in new research published by Yates and her colleagues in the journal &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw1923" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they propose that babies are able to form memories, even if they become inaccessible later in life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These results might reveal something crucial about the earliest moments of our development. "That's the time when we learn who our parents are, that's when we learn language, that's when we learn how to walk," Yates says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What happens in your brain in the first two years of life is magnificent," says &lt;a href="https://ntblab.yale.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Nick Turk-Browne&lt;/a&gt;, a cognitive neuroscientist at Yale University. "That's the period of by far the greatest plasticity across your whole life span. And better understanding how your brain learns and remembers in infancy lays the foundation for everything you know and do for the rest of your life."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Babies are the worst — subjects&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's a reason we don't know much about infant memories. One of the best ways to look deep in the brain is with an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine, which requires a person to remain still for an extended period of time — but just try to get a baby to cooperate with that!&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Infants in many ways are the worst possible subject population," admits Turk-Browne. "They don't understand instructions. It's like taking a photograph — you get a blurry picture [so] you can't move a millimeter. And also they have really short attention spans. So we had to adapt."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Turk-Browne and his colleagues have spent nearly a decade figuring out how to do fMRI research on babies. They have come up with all sorts of tricks to keep them happy and engaged. If they cry, the experiment stops so the baby can play or go for a walk. "We have them bring comfort items like a pacifier or a blanket or a toy," he says. "I've given babies a bottle during these scans."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The researchers nestle the baby in bedding, the child's parent is always in the room with them, and the tasks required of them are short. "It's the only way to be able to ask what's going on in the infant's mind despite not being able to ask them questions," says Turk-Browne. "You can look at their brain and their brain has the answers."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Screen time in the name of science&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here's how this particular experiment went down. The babies were shown a video inside the fMRI machine. Throughout, the background displays a green kaleidoscopic pattern — "this kind pf psychedelic screen meant to have infants fixate towards the center of the screen," says Yates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, one image at a time appears for two seconds before disappearing. These are images that they have never seen before — a canyon, a dog toy, a woman's face.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"About a minute later," says Yates, "we show them one image they just saw alongside a different image from the same category." That could be the canyon, say, alongside a waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the baby remembered seeing the canyon earlier, the child will look longer at the canyon than at the waterfall. "It's as if you're still learning about it, so you're looking at it more," says Turk-Browne. "It's only really when they have a preference for the familiar thing that we take that as evidence of successful memory formation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This procedure gave the researchers an indication as to which images the baby remembered, and which they forgot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the fMRI was snapping pictures of the baby's brain, including its hippocampus, "a region that we know is super important for memory in adults," says Yates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The scans revealed that starting at about 12 months of age, the more activity there was in the baby's hippocampus when seeing an image for the first time — like that canyon — the more likely they were to remember that image later.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"What we're able to conclude is that the hippocampus can encode individual memories, even in human infants," says Yates. She and her colleagues say it's evidence that a memory has formed in the baby's hippocampus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Unlocking our earliest moments&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These results allow scientists to "put the time stamp of our first memory a little bit earlier than when we thought possible," says &lt;a href="https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/about/administration/administration-a-z/overview/unit/research-group-flavio-donato" target="_blank"&gt;Flavio Donato&lt;/a&gt;, a neurobiologist at the University of Basel who wasn't involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says it now appears that infancy isn't a passive, forgettable stage of our lives — a relevant consideration for how we raise and educate children, and even how we understand early trauma or stress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's an important question," says Donato, "how these traumatic events might lead to memories or traces in the brain that might persist for a long time and might even influence the way in which this person will develop."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's still a lot to figure out. Just how durable are the memories we may be storing as infants? And if they're still there, locked away in our older brains, are they forever off limits?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The question is," asks Turk-Browne, "could you circumvent that in some way to help kids, or adults even, potentially reactivate old memories?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To try to answer this question, the researchers are performing another study in which they ask families to record home videos from their baby's perspective. Later, in the lab, when they play those videos for the infants, they will look to see what's happening in the infant's hippocampus — and just how long those earliest of memories may persist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new discovery highlights how the network that is involved in creating and storing word memories is dispersed throughout the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly crucial for helping to understand conditions such as epilepsy, in which patients may have difficulty with remembering words. The researchers hope that their findings will help guide neurosurgical treatment for patients with epilepsy by helping surgeons to avoid parts of the brain important for language and memory, that may otherwise be affected, when doing operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corresponding author, Professor John Duncan (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology) said: “Being able to remember and recall words is important for day-to-day memory to work well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Detailed MRI brain scans are used to find out the causes of epilepsy and can show if any parts of the brain are shrunken. By measuring the parts of the brain that are shrunken and how well a person can remember words, we can work out which parts of the brain are used for making and storing memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, if medication has not stopped seizures occurring, this helps us to guide neurosurgical treatment for a person’s epilepsy, to avoid damaging the parts of the brain that are needed for memory to work well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first study of its kind, the researchers examined 84 people with temporal lobe epilepsy (epilepsy arising from the temporal lobe at the sides of the head) and hippocampal sclerosis (a condition in which part of the brain is scarred, and memory is affected) and 43 healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients were divided into those with left-sided and right-sided hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-resolution MRI scans were used to measure the size and shape of different parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex (the outer layer of the brain responsible for thinking, memory, attention, perception, awareness, and language) and specific areas within the hippocampus (the part of the brain that helps with learning, memory, and spatial navigation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants underwent standardised tests to assess their verbal memory. These tests were part of the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery, which measures how well people can remember and recall words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then compared the memory test scores to the sizes of different brain areas, to see if smaller brain parts were linked to worse memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that smaller sizes in certain brain areas, like the prefrontal, temporal and cingulate cortices, and parts of the hippocampus, were linked to worse memory for words in people with epilepsy arising in their temporal lobes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are also important for understanding how the brain organises and remembers words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Dr Giorgio Fiore (National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH) said: “This research is important as it helps us to understand how memory may fail and may help guide the designing of neurosurgical operations for epilepsy that will not make memory worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was funded by the Epilepsy Research UK and supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR UCLH BRC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#05752b716a686776457066692b64662b706e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Poppy Tombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Poppy Tombs – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cortico-hippocampal networks underpin verbal memory encoding in temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;” by John Duncan et al. &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortico-hippocampal networks underpin verbal memory encoding in temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of the structural underpinnings of human verbal memory is scarce. Understanding the human verbal memory network at a finer anatomical scale will have important clinical implications for the management of patients with verbal memory impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to assess the contributions of cerebral cortex and hippocampal subfields to verbal memory encoding in temporal lobe epilepsy. We included consecutive patients (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 84) with radiologically and pathologically defined hippocampal sclerosis (HS) (44 left-sided) and unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy, and healthy volunteers (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 43) who were comparable regarding age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The morphometric and volumetric measures of cerebral cortex and hippocampal subfields were extracted from high-resolution MRI scans. People included in this study underwent standardized neuropsychological evaluation, including measures of verbal memory assessed through the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbal memory performances were &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;-scores corrected by using means and standard deviations published for sample standardization. Associations between verbal learning &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;-scores and the grey matter volume of the cerebral cortex and hippocampal subfields were investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduction of grey matter volumes in the left and right medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), superior and middle temporal gyri (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and parietal–temporal–occipital junction (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) were associated with worse verbal learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings were consistent across both the entire cohort and in a subgroup analysis focused exclusively on HS patients. Within hippocampi, smaller volumes of the left dentate gyrus (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003), cornu ammonis 4 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005) and cornu ammonis 3 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03) were associated with worse verbal learning &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;-scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that verbal learning in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy is strongly related to the volume of distinct regions of the prefrontal, temporal and cingulate cortices and left dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis 4 and cornu ammonis 3 hippocampal subfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It provides the basis to suggest a corticohippocampal network for verbal learning in these patients, improving our understanding of human verbal memory. These biomarkers may inform attractive targets for forthcoming modulating therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work may also analyse the impact of sparing part of the left dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis 4 and cornu ammonis 3 as a protective measure against verbal memory impairment after surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 20:03:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFA2VHdleFhTRXl6SFVKSUc0VGtqVF96U3o4akY1YTVIYngybUpLNXRRVV9POE9xZ2V2R2d6eWd2VldBRFQxWUpzc2tTUHZadms2Z3NqaHBvVC1IRGFWQkJFMXJ1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Changes in Sleep Patterns Could Predict Dementia Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE9fTWZKWU9GcWJnZ3ZuRl9JMzlyRzJoeFdEeWdSMnA1ZFBldV9pZi1oMnI3SVBjVnVaeFAzemdEWkxpUUF5cGQ4Nk8ydVN3VGItdHFNdFR2Z3NqdUhSOVJqS0c3TWZKVlh1WGhQZHV2cWhlZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study finds that women in their 80s who develop increasing daytime sleepiness over five years are twice as likely to develop dementia.

Our study found that sleep problems may be intertwined with cognitive aging and may serve as an early marker or risk factor for dementia in women in their 80s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers looked at 733 female participants with an average age of 83 who did not have mild cognitive impairment or dementia at the start of the study. They were followed over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, 164 participants, or 22%, developed mild cognitive impairment and 93 participants, or 13%, developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants wore wrist devices to track their sleep and circadian rhythm patterns for three days at the start and end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at the changes in nighttime sleep duration and quality, daytime napping and circadian rhythm patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five years, researchers observed large changes in sleep patterns in more than half of the participants, or 56%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that participants fell into three groups: stable sleep or small improvements in sleep, 44%; declining nighttime sleep, 35%; and increasing sleepiness, 21%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declining nighttime sleep included decreases in nighttime sleep quality and duration, moderate increases in napping and worsening circadian rhythms. Increasing sleepiness included increases in both daytime and nighttime sleep duration and quality, along with worsening circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then looked at how these changes were linked to the risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those in the stable sleep group, 25, or 8%, developed dementia. In the declining nighttime sleep group, 39, or 15%, developed dementia. In the increasing sleepiness group, 29, or 19%, developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, education and race, and health factors such as diabetes and high blood pressure, researchers found that participants in the increasing sleepiness group had double the risk of dementia compared to those in the stable sleep group. No association was found in the declining nighttime sleep group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that sleeping, napping and circadian rhythms can change dramatically over only five years for women in their 80s,” Leng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This highlights the need for future studies to look at all aspects of daily sleep patterns to better understand how changes in these patterns over time can be linked to dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that it included primarily white people, so the results cannot be generalized to more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep, aging, and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3745435244445a5659775656591954585a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Renee Tessman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Renee Tessman – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 19:52:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9fTWZKWU9GcWJnZ3ZuRl9JMzlyRzJoeFdEeWdSMnA1ZFBldV9pZi1oMnI3SVBjVnVaeFAzemdEWkxpUUF5cGQ4Nk8ydVN3VGItdHFNdFR2Z3NqdUhSOVJqS0c3TWZKVlh1WGhQZHV2cWhlZw</guid></item><item><title>Study illuminates the structural features of memory formation at cellular and subcellular levels - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPOXFmSVVGelc4SnBVQ2N1YXdDMjBNcWlZS25ETGVfR3A2VFNGR1NfUkNGRUVQRUd3aUcxcFc4UXdmeEo1NEpEOExBa2N1LWszX05UMlpEYWZjbDJDQ1dwNDNMUm5tdl9LRnBFbEhvZFFUcDk4dW44dVBUVUpUeUpsQ2NMRU5YdnFLYzFYV1RkV3psUDc5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have revealed the structural underpinnings of memory formation across a broad network of neurons in the mouse brain. This work sheds light on the fundamentally flexible nature of how memories are made, detailing learning-related changes at the cellular and subcellular levels with unprecedented resolution. Understanding this flexibility may help explain why memory and learning processes sometimes go awry.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado8316" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, showed that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neurons/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; assigned to a memory trace reorganized their connections to other neurons through an atypical type of connection called a multi-synaptic bouton. In a multi-synaptic bouton, the axon of the neuron relaying the signal with information contacts multiple neurons that receive the signal. According to the researchers, multi-synaptic boutons may enable the cellular flexibility of information coding observed in previous research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that neurons involved in memory formation were not preferentially connected with each other. This finding challenges the idea that "neurons that fire together wire together," as would be predicted by a traditional theory of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers observed that neurons allocated to a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory+trace/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory trace&lt;/a&gt; reorganized certain intracellular structures that provide energy and support communication and plasticity in neuronal connections. These neurons also had enhanced interactions with support cells known as astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of advanced genetic tools, 3D electron microscopy, and artificial intelligence, Scripps Research scientists Marco Uytiepo, Anton Maximov, Ph.D., and colleagues reconstructed a wiring diagram of neurons involved in learning and identified structural changes to these neurons and their connections at the cellular and subcellular levels.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;To examine structural features associated with learning, the researchers exposed mice to a conditioning task and examined the hippocampus region of the brain about a week later. They selected this time point because it occurs after memories are first encoded but before they are reorganized for long-term storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using advanced genetic techniques, the researchers permanently labeled subsets of hippocampal neurons activated during learning, which enabled reliable identification. They then used 3D electron microscopy and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/artificial+intelligence+algorithms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence algorithms&lt;/a&gt; to produce nanoscale reconstructions of the excitatory neural networks involved in learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides a comprehensive view of the structural hallmarks of memory formation in one brain region. It also raises new questions for further exploration. Future studies will be crucial in determining whether similar mechanisms operate across different time points and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+circuits/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural circuits&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, further investigation into the molecular composition of multi-synaptic boutons is needed to determine their precise role in memory and other cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;New research reveals why adults cannot recall infant memories despite having formed them during early development.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Yale University researchers studied brain activity in 26 infants using fMRI scans while showing them images.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;The study found hippocampus activity was stronger in babies who were 12 months or older during memory encoding.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Researchers tracked infants' eye movements to determine which images they recognized from previous viewings.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Despite memory inaccessibility later in life, early experiences contribute significantly to language acquisition and learning.&lt;/li&gt;

            Do you ever wonder what it was like to be a baby? But no matter how hard you try, you can’t remember any of the details?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0004356mxzgfqjpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not that you don’t have memories from infancy — it’s that you simply can’t access them later in life, new research shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0005356mttk9xbbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adt7570" target="_blank"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, examined 26 infants ranging from 4.2 to 24.9 months, split into two age groups: those younger than 12 months and those 12 to 24 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0006356m6ldx4npa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the experiment, babies were placed in an &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri" target="_blank"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; machine and shown a series of unique images for two seconds each. Researchers aimed to record activity in the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hippocampus" target="_blank"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; — the portion of the brain associated with emotions, memory and the autonomic nervous system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0007356m09ipz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The hippocampus is a deep brain structure that is not visible to standard methods, so we had to develop a new approach for conducting memory experiments with babies inside an MRI machine,” said Dr. Nick Turk-Browne, lead study author and professor in the department of psychology at Yale University, via email. “This kind of research has previously been done mostly while infants are asleep, because they wiggle a lot, cannot follow instructions and have short attention spans.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0008356mg3q3qd2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Simona Ghetti, a professor in the department of psychology at the University of California, Davis, whose research focuses on the development of memory in childhood, acknowledged that while many studies have already demonstrated infants’ capacity to encode memories, this latest research is unique in that it links memory encoding to hippocampal activation. Ghetti was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0009356mcq2d1tp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After a momentary delay, the babies were then shown two images side by side: one of familiar images they had seen before and one that was new. Researchers tracked the babies’ eye movements, noting which image they focused on longer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi000a356m5exf4vug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If an infant spent more time looking at the familiar image, it suggested they recognized it, indicating memory recall. If they didn’t show any preference, it likely meant their memory was less developed, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi000b356m3jpod1ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Eye movements have been used in hundreds of studies on infant memory and  categorization,” Ghetti said via email. “Infants look at what they find interesting, and researchers have long leveraged this spontaneous behavior to derive information about memory functioning.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2jioi0000356m6c6djnu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once they collected the initial data, the team analyzed fMRI scans of babies who looked at the familiar image longer, comparing them with those who had no preference. Trials were excluded if the baby wasn’t focused on the screen and moved or blinked excessively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000l356mm2f4iqht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings revealed that the hippocampus was more active in older infants when encoding memories. Additionally, only older infants exhibited activity in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15134840/" target="_blank"&gt;orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a key role in memory-related decision-making and recognition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000m356mwdwbfcr1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One thing we have learned about memory in adults is that the information we tend to capture and encode into memory are things that are highly relevant to our experience,” said Dr. Lila Davachi, a professor in the department of psychology at Columbia University, who was not involved in the study. “The amazing thing about this study is convincingly showing hippocampal encoding processes in babies for stimuli that are, in some sense, unimportant to them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000n356mimym7cw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though it’s still unclear why memory encoding seems to be stronger in babies more than 12 months old, it’s likely a result of major alterations taking place in the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000o356mi234e78e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The infant brain undergoes many perceptual, linguistic, motor, biological and other changes around this time, including the rapid anatomical growth of the hippocampus,” Turk-Browne said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000p356mkyq1i3wf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Turk-Browne and his team are actively working to test why the brain is unable to retrieve these early memories in life, but he speculates that the brain processing in infants may suggest the hippocampus isn’t receiving the accurate “search terms” to find the memory as it was stored based on the experiences the baby was having at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kwml000j356m9trz9z7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ghetti encourages parents to think about the impact infancy has on their children, even if the children can’t retrieve memories they experienced at such an early age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000y356mxipkbbdg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies are learning an enormous amount at this age, which is how they begin to take in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an entire language by associating sounds with meanings, Ghetti said. She added that infants are also forming expectations around their family members and studying properties of objects and the world around them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000z356masojst20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents often see this learned behavior when they sing the same song or read the same book, which Davachi&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;noted produces a familiar response in older children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0010356mf34dp69l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Using repetition with babies will open up a greater connection between parent and baby,” she said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0011356mc4pdm3l0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though you can’t recall those earliest memories as an adult, it’s fair to say that you’re learning from those experiences, which can be true for both neutral and emotional information, Ghetti said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0012356mdwfd7362@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This can remind parents that infancy is not idle&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;time&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and that infants are learning a great deal,” Ghetti said. “Offering opportunities for visual exploration may be important for cultivating learning skills.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists are trying to tackle  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="155400" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; from all angles, and a new study adds to the growing evidence that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt;, a widely used  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="155400" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and weight loss drug, could also be beneficial in easing some of the disease's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in China used mouse models of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the effects of the drug, sold under brand names such as Ozempic for type 2 diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide appears to help immune cells switch to a more protective state, suggesting its potential to slow or prevent disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's mice (known as 3xTg), treatment with semaglutide over the course of a month showed numerous positive signs compared to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="155400" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. In the brains of 3xTg mice, for example, the drug reduced the levels of amyloid-beta protein build up, a toxic process that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-how-alzheimer-s-causes-cells-to-overheat-and-fry-like-eggs"&gt;comes in tandem&lt;/a&gt; with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in experiments set up to test memory and learning, 3xTg mice treated with semaglutide showed improved long-term and short-term memory performance – almost on a par with the healthy mice being used as a control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These behavioral results showed that exogenous administration of semaglutide significantly improved the learning, memory, and cognitive behavior disorders of 3xTg mice," &lt;a href="https://www.ibroneuroscience.org/article/S0306-4522(24)00604-3/abstract"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were more benefits too. The treated mice showed reduced levels of molecules known to trigger inflammation in the brain, while boosting the number of molecules with anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's crucial to the effects of semaglutide, the researchers think: a reduction in the damage inflammation does to brains with Alzheimer's. This inflammation is partly down to immune cells called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"&gt;microglia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brains of the treated mice, some microglia switched from attack (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fragi.2023.1231706"&gt;a mode known as M1&lt;/a&gt;) to a more neutral state (M2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This switching of microglia activity was also shown in further lab tests carried out by the researchers: semaglutide was shown to change the response of immune cells to the presence of amyloid-beta proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We speculate that semaglutide shows an anti-inflammatory effect by promoting the transformation of microglia from M1 to M2 type in the brain of 3xTg mice, and thus exerts a neuroprotective effect," &lt;a href="https://www.ibroneuroscience.org/article/S0306-4522(24)00604-3/abstract"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155403" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155403" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MicrogliaChange.jpg" alt="Microglia change" class="wp-image-155403 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MicrogliaChange.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MicrogliaChange-600x292.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155403" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers noticed a key switch in some immune cells. (Wang et al., &lt;em&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between semaglutide and protection against Alzheimer's has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028390823003064"&gt;been made before&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists are still trying to figure out the extent of this protection and the mechanisms responsible for it, so that effective treatments can be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide could well be effective in reducing the damage done by Alzheimer's, based on these results – or perhaps stop it from fully developing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these results in mice need to be replicated in people, and over a longer term, efforts to get those confirmations have already begun. That means new hope for the &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12694"&gt;millions of people&lt;/a&gt; living with Alzheimer's – and the millions more at risk of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previous studies have shown that semaglutide is effective in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0143417918300684"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028390819303077"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;a href="https://www.ibroneuroscience.org/article/S0306-4522(24)00604-3/abstract"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers. "Importantly, Phase 3 trials of semaglutide in Alzheimer's disease patients are currently underway."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.ibroneuroscience.org/article/S0306-4522(24)00604-3/abstract"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. proposed a novel fix to the nation’s &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/bird-flu" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="bird flu" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/bird-flu" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; epidemic: Let the virus spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flocks so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it,” Kennedy said of poultry farmers and federal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the nation’s agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, who has authority over the nation’s poultry management, not Kennedy. But Rollins appears to be in agreement with her counterpart at HHS. As &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The New York Times noted" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;The New York Times noted&lt;/a&gt;, she floated the idea of a pilot program that would allow the disease to ravage a flock, while extra layers of protection contained the spread within a certain perimeter. The surviving birds could then be studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are reasons that scientists recommend immediately culling infected flocks, and letting the virus run rampant could have dire consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bird flu, H5N1, has a near 100% fatality rate in chickens and turkeys, and has already &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/h5n1-bird-flu-what-to-know" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="killed millions of wild birds" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/h5n1-bird-flu-what-to-know" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;killed millions of wild birds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways it can spread to healthy poultry farms is by a single infected duck visiting a flock and shedding the virus through feces. H5N1 kills relatively quickly, causing respiratory distress, swelling, lack of coordination &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="and other symptoms before death" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;and other symptoms before death&lt;/a&gt;. (Culling is therefore considered more humane.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has cropped up on farms and in backyard flocks around the country, resulting in some 166 million birds culled so far — resulting in the alarmingly high egg prices seen around the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not common, humans can become infected with H5N1, and one person in the U.S. has died of the infection. Most of the human cases so far have been seen in those who have had prolonged contact with infected birds or dairy cows.

Kennedy Jr. proposed a novel fix to the nation’s &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/bird-flu" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="bird flu" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/bird-flu" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; epidemic: Let the virus spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flocks so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it,” Kennedy said of poultry farmers and federal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the nation’s agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, who has authority over the nation’s poultry management, not Kennedy. But Rollins appears to be in agreement with her counterpart at HHS. As &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The New York Times noted" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;The New York Times noted&lt;/a&gt;, she floated the idea of a pilot program that would allow the disease to ravage a flock, while extra layers of protection contained the spread within a certain perimeter. The surviving birds could then be studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are reasons that scientists recommend immediately culling infected flocks, and letting the virus run rampant could have dire consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bird flu, H5N1, has a near 100% fatality rate in chickens and turkeys, and has already &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/h5n1-bird-flu-what-to-know" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="killed millions of wild birds" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/h5n1-bird-flu-what-to-know" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;killed millions of wild birds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways it can spread to healthy poultry farms is by a single infected duck visiting a flock and shedding the virus through feces. H5N1 kills relatively quickly, causing respiratory distress, swelling, lack of coordination &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="and other symptoms before death" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;and other symptoms before death&lt;/a&gt;. (Culling is therefore considered more humane.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has cropped up on farms and in backyard flocks around the country, resulting in some 166 million birds culled so far — resulting in the alarmingly high egg prices seen around the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not common, humans can become infected with H5N1, and one person in the U.S. has died of the infection. Most of the human cases so far have been seen in those who have had prolonged contact with infected birds or dairy cows. There has been no human-to-human transmission &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="observed in the United States" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;observed in the United States&lt;/a&gt; so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that could change.

&lt;p&gt;Cod liver oil contains high levels of vitamin A, which is sometimes administered to measles patients under a physician's supervision. But the supplement is mostly a supportive treatment in children with vitamin deficiencies, and taking too much can cause toxicity. Nevertheless, Kennedy has touted the vitamin and falsely claimed that good nutrition protects against the virus, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/measles-outbreak-hits-208-cases-as-federal-outbreak-response-goes-off-the-rails/"&gt;much to the dismay of pediatricians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They had a really good, quick recovery," the mother said of her other four children, attributing their recovery to the unproven treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tragic misinformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most children do recover from measles, regardless of whether they're given cod liver oil. The fatality rate of measles &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;is nearly 1 to 3 in 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt;, who die with respiratory (e.g., pneumonia) or neurological complications from the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommey noted that the sibling who died didn't get the alternative treatments, leading the audience to believe that this could have contributed to her death. She also questioned what was written on the death certificate, noting that the girl's pneumonia was from a secondary bacterial infection, not the virus directly, a clear effort to falsely suggest measles was not the cause of death and downplay the dangers of the disease. The parents said they hadn't received the death certificate yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommey then turned to the MMR vaccine, asking if the mother still felt that it was a dangerous vaccine after her daughter's death from the disease, prefacing the question by claiming to have seen a lot of "injury" from the vaccine. "Do you still feel the same way about the MMR vaccine versus measles?" she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes, absolutely; we would absolutely not take the MMR. The measles wasn't that bad, and they got over it pretty quickly," the mother replied, speaking again of her four living children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So," Tommey continued, "when you see the fearmongering in the press, which is what we want to stop, that is why we want to get the truth out, what do you say to the parents who are rushing out, panicking, to get the MMR for their 6-month-old baby because they think that that child is going to die of measles because of what happened to your daughter?"&lt;/p&gt;

So what I mean by that is no one's going to their doctor and saying "I feel different" or "I feel as though my functional status has changed," but what's happening is, silently in the background, things are changing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;span class="text-items"&gt;&lt;span class="pullquote-quotation"&gt;&lt;svg class="pullquote-quotation-open" version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117"&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g display="none"&gt;&lt;g display="inline"&gt; &lt;path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;For the longest time in the field of immunology, there was the sort of adage that your immune system needs to be tested every now and again to stay strong.

There was a recent 2024 &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2311330" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that showed us that individuals who survive an acute COVID-19 infection — these are not individuals who are getting diagnosed with long COVID — on average will lose somewhere in the neighbourhood of two to six IQ points per infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really, with each infection?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;According to the most recent study, yes. So there is a cumulative effect that can be occurring with each infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Early in the pandemic, we actually published a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35768006/" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; where we showed that, even in animal models — when we infected mice with a very, very mild case of SARS-CoV-2 infection — which only caused lung inflammation, we still saw these inflammatory chemicals called chemokines emerging from the infected lungs and starting to attack central nervous system structures such as the spinal cord and the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow. So in other words, COVID is doing more than just infecting the lungs; it's going to other parts of the body&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Exactly. You know, this is a virus that, once it enters the body, is very capable of entering the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00336-5" target="_blank"&gt;bloodstream&lt;/a&gt;, creating immune responses that travel all over the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID is largely known as a respiratory disease. Can you walk me through the range of other body systems that might be vulnerable to long-term damage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Well, in all of the peer-reviewed literature that has emerged on &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl0867" target="_blank"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, we've seen that it is a very diffuse clinical syndrome where every single organ system can be affected. And at last count, over 200 symptoms have been catalogued as potential symptoms of long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When we actually dig into the science of why long COVID is causing the symptoms that it's causing, we see that there are problems such as what we call "&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adk3295" target="_blank"&gt;viral persistence&lt;/a&gt;." Meaning the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not being effectively cleared by the body and it's sticking around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It's hiding out in different areas of the body in what we typically call "immune privileged sites," which mean that immune cells don't actually go there and can't sort of seek out and destroy the virus. So that can happen in a number of different locations in the body, which leads to a wide array of symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We also see that the virus can cause prolonged chronic inflammation that can be whole-body wide. So it can affect every single organ and so often, many of the symptoms that people are experiencing are more related to which organ is most susceptible to them given their past medical history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So we see things that are quite insidious. People who were pre-diabetic are suddenly diabetic. People who were having a few issues with gallbladder, suddenly can't digest fat anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;figure class="imageMedia image full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;COVID infections can lead to long-term health effects in nearly every organ system in the body.  (Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, what is it about the coronavirus that enables it to spread throughout the body like that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2021, two colleagues of mine published a really wonderful &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.698169/full" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that I think is very prescient and it spoke about why SARS-CoV-2 presents such an increased threat to cause persistent symptoms. The reality of that situation is that this virus has a lot of very unique qualities that specifically cause immune damage to the host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So it's not just about infecting you and causing respiratory illness and fever and all of the things that we usually get with the viral infection. This virus also specifically causes your immune system to become weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It disrupts what we call "interferon signalling," which is part of the immune system that helps you to fight off infections or latent infections, such as Epstein Barr virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Typically our immune system can keep these things suppressed, but when SARS-CoV-2 enters the picture, it starts to cause altered interferon signalling. It causes immune damage and dysregulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;span class="text-items"&gt;&lt;span class="pullquote-quotation"&gt;&lt;svg class="pullquote-quotation-open" version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117"&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g display="none"&gt;&lt;g display="inline"&gt; &lt;path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Although your immune system can take on [a COVID] infection, you want to avoid testing it as much as possible because your body is sustaining damage with each infection that it survives.&lt;svg class="pullquote-quotation-close" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117"&gt;&lt;g display="none"&gt;&lt;g display="inline"&gt;&lt;path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite class="pullquote-source"&gt;- David Putrino, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And suddenly, not only does your body have trouble clearing the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself, but it also starts to have trouble keeping some of these other viruses that have been latent from reactivating and causing problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to SARS-CoV-2's ability to dysregulate the immune system and suppress the immune system, the spike protein itself is very damaging to blood vessel structures as well as red blood cells and platelets themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And so between those two features, the ability to dysregulate the immune system and the ability to cause systemic damage throughout the bloodstream, you have a very dangerous novel virus on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;figure class="imageMedia image full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;A scanning electron micrograph of an cell heavily infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Meaning that their T cells, which are parts of the immune system that are typically used to fight off infections, are starting to present as exhausted — that there has been a persistent stimulation of these T cells for long enough that their responses over time are starting to weaken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a result, in this study we saw immune dysregulation, we saw hormonal dysregulation, we saw reactivation of herpes viruses that were previously thought to be latent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And as we have made leaps and bounds in our ability to understand the role of these persistent pathogens, these things that we used to think, "Everybody's got Epstein-Barr virus, but don't worry, it sort of just lays dormant in your body and it doesn't cause any trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What we're learning is that, well, it very much can cause trouble. If it's mixed with another pathogen and that pathogen causes the reactivation, then people can get very, very sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For the longest time in the field of immunology, there was the sort of adage that your immune system needs to be tested every now and again to stay strong. That's an old-fashioned idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The more new-fashioned and evidence-based idea is that, although your immune system can take on [a COVID] infection, you want to avoid testing it as much as possible because your body is sustaining damage with each infection that it survives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CBC.ca</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 18:04:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBDdlhRS0J3MnAzeU00QUh5R3FuTTY0eGM4NVV6SEgtdm5VWTVadE85bnNNV2hmZ01HdW9PWW01eWUwTVBiRjVMeDF3SlN6V3YwMlJPdjJkaDFlZktzUTBiS3BmZ29xX2dNZ3Fv0gFHQVVfeXFMTzNCQXJQVFJMblBpQXRlYTAxekZyOG9WV1I3VDVTSThBdVhDVFpQM2t1eWxXT3pPWUplSTBjY1ZsVXgzV3dZaW8</guid></item><item><title>This Study Says This Is the Healthiest Diet in the World - Glamour</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQRTh6OGdENkw1RWZ3TjUyR3FhZkFPMkItbjJTQjRzdU5CUlMwMmJxVnV5eDFvUEtMdmhnOTJ4aDEzMklXLTNycGprbER5TzVYSDVRRlZSV3JXZkdpWFJsVFFPdk14OG9XaGI4a0gxYTZMbW1SN1JvQmpFclIya3hVbTRmWGFCYkdLUEt6c0g0MTJUaVBM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the healthiest diet one can eat? A study claims to have finally found the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not such an easy task, considering there are so many hyped diets out there. Chances are you know somebody who’s adopted a keto, paleo, pescatarian, or vegan diet in recent years—if that wasn’t you yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523005117?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; looked at how healthy six of the most common diets are and compared how they affect not only the body, but also the environment. The researchers used data from a statistical survey by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In the study, 16,800 adults were asked about their diet between 2005 and 2010. If participants could not be clearly assigned to one type of diet, they were excluded. The researchers were able to categorize the remaining results into six of the most common diets, from vegan to pescatarian to omnivorous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK jKxoyb"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG iQXARC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV fiEZuU"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common diets, according to the study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ bXyBUt rQqEH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS iTPNai opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined six common diets that emerged from the survey. Those were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegan&lt;/strong&gt;: Vegans eat an exclusively plant-based diet and avoid animal products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetarian&lt;/strong&gt;: Vegetarians do not eat meat or fish, but will eat animal products like milk and eggs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pescatarian&lt;/strong&gt;: Pescatarians eat fish, seafood, and other animal products such as eggs and milk, but no meat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paleo:&lt;/strong&gt; This diet is based on the Stone Age, before humans became sedentary. Meat, eggs, and nuts are on the menu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keto:&lt;/strong&gt; In the ketogenic diet, over 80 percent of calories come from healthy fats and the diet all but eliminates carbohydrates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnivorous diets:&lt;/strong&gt; This is how the study categorized all other diets, which more or less include all the food groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG iQXARC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV fiEZuU"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the researchers evaluated the individual diets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ bXyBUt rQqEH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS iTPNai opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine which diet is the healthiest—both for you and the planet—the scientists evaluated the dietary information according to quality and climate footprint. In terms of quality, or how healthy the diet is, points were awarded for certain food groups. The higher the score, the closer the diet is to the recommendations for a healthy diet in general. The average greenhouse gas emissions of each diet were also taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="and-the-healthiest-diet-is" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;And the healthiest diet is…&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diet with the highest score in terms of health and environmental impact is the pescatarian diet. This is also consistent with &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322522#Fishing-for-details" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322522#Fishing-for-details"}' href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322522#Fishing-for-details" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; that have found that people who eat fish regularly live longer on average. This is mainly due to the omega-3 fatty acids fish contains, which can help lower your blood pressure and thus lower the risk for cardiovascular diseases and blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pescatarian diet was closely followed by the vegetarian and vegan diets, with their emphasis on plant-based foods, while the lowest scores went to the paleo and keto diets. These results are generally in line with the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf#page=114" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf#page=114"}' href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf#page=114" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which recommends prioritizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and lean proteins like seafood, poultry, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of carbon footprint, the vegan diet scored best followed by the vegetarian diet. The meat-heavy paleo and keto diets fared the worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="what-are-the-benefits-of-a-pescatarian-diet" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The benefits of a pescatarian diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested in becoming a pescatarian now? We asked Tamar Samuels, MS, RD, and the cofounder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://culinahealth.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://culinahealth.com/"}' href="https://culinahealth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Culina Health&lt;/a&gt;, about some of the diet’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A well-planned pescatarian diet offers numerous health benefits, mainly due to the nutritional value of fish and the inclusion of plant-based foods,” the expert says. “Fish is an excellent source of high-quality protein, providing essential amino acids necessary for muscle maintenance, immune function, and overall health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acid content.&lt;/strong&gt; “One of the most significant benefits of consuming fish is its rich omega-3 fatty acid content, particularly EPA (eicosatetraenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid),” Samuels says. “These essential fats play a crucial role in heart health by reducing inflammation, lowering triglycerides, and supporting healthy blood pressure levels. Omega-3s are also vital for brain function, contributing to cognitive health, reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and supporting mental well-being. Additionally, DHA is essential for fetal brain development during pregnancy, making fish consumption particularly beneficial for expecting mothers.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lower risk for cardiovascular disease and better long-term health.&lt;/strong&gt; “Pescatarians tend to have a more favorable cardiovascular risk profile, including lower BMI, cholesterol, and hypertension levels compared to omnivores,” says Samuels. “This diet is also linked to lower DNA damage than vegetarian diets, which may contribute to better long-term health outcomes.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better eye health over time.&lt;/strong&gt; “Regular fish consumption in a pescatarian diet is associated with reduced risk of visual impairment, such as age-related macular degeneration,” Samuels adds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pescatarian diet risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all its many benefits, Samuels recommends being mindful about making sure you can still get all the nutrients you need before adopting a pescatarian diet as there are risks involved. Talk to a doctor about your dietary requirements if you have any questions or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without careful planning, pescatarian diets can lead to deficiencies in nutrients like iron, particularly in women of reproductive age,” the expert explains. “A well-planned pescatarian diet offers numerous health benefits, but several key considerations should be kept in mind to ensure optimal nutrition and minimize potential risks.” Some of those are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrient balance.&lt;/strong&gt; “One important factor is nutrient balance—while fish provides high-quality protein and essential omega-3 fatty acids, a pescatarian diet should also include a variety of plant-based foods, such as legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds, to ensure adequate fiber, vitamins, and minerals,” Samuels says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mercury exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; “Another critical factor is mercury exposure, as some fish contain high levels of mercury, which can be harmful, particularly for pregnant women and young children,” says Samuels. “To reduce risk, it is advisable to prioritize low-mercury seafood options such as salmon, sardines, trout, and shrimp while limiting intake of high-mercury fish like tuna, swordfish, and king mackerel.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sustainability of seafood choices.&lt;/strong&gt; “Beyond individual health concerns, the sustainability of seafood choices is an important consideration,” advises Samuels. “Overfishing and unsustainable fishing practices contribute to environmental damage, so opting for seafood certified by organizations like the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or following recommendations from guides such as the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch can help reduce ecological impact.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this post was previously published in &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.de/artikel/studie-diese-ernaehrungsform-ist-die-gesuendeste-der-welt" target="_blank"&gt;Glamour Germany.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Glamour</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 18:01:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQRTh6OGdENkw1RWZ3TjUyR3FhZkFPMkItbjJTQjRzdU5CUlMwMmJxVnV5eDFvUEtMdmhnOTJ4aDEzMklXLTNycGprbER5TzVYSDVRRlZSV3JXZkdpWFJsVFFPdk14OG9XaGI4a0gxYTZMbW1SN1JvQmpFclIya3hVbTRmWGFCYkdLUEt6c0g0MTJUaVBM</guid></item><item><title>Don’t remember being a baby?

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;New research reveals why adults cannot recall infant memories despite having formed them during early development.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Yale University researchers studied brain activity in 26 infants using fMRI scans while showing them images.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;The study found hippocampus activity was stronger in babies who were 12 months or older during memory encoding.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Researchers tracked infants' eye movements to determine which images they recognized from previous viewings.&lt;/li&gt;

            Do you ever wonder what it was like to be a baby? But no matter how hard you try, you can’t remember any of the details?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0004356mxzgfqjpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not that you don’t have memories from infancy — it’s that you simply can’t access them later in life, new research shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0005356mttk9xbbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adt7570" target="_blank"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, examined 26 infants ranging from 4.2 to 24.9 months, split into two age groups: those younger than 12 months and those 12 to 24 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0006356m6ldx4npa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the experiment, babies were placed in an &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri" target="_blank"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; machine and shown a series of unique images for two seconds each. Researchers aimed to record activity in the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hippocampus" target="_blank"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; — the portion of the brain associated with emotions, memory and the autonomic nervous system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0007356m09ipz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The hippocampus is a deep brain structure that is not visible to standard methods, so we had to develop a new approach for conducting memory experiments with babies inside an MRI machine,” said Dr. Nick Turk-Browne, lead study author and professor in the department of psychology at Yale University, via email. “This kind of research has previously been done mostly while infants are asleep, because they wiggle a lot, cannot follow instructions and have short attention spans.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0008356mg3q3qd2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Simona Ghetti, a professor in the department of psychology at the University of California, Davis, whose research focuses on the development of memory in childhood, acknowledged that while many studies have already demonstrated infants’ capacity to encode memories, this latest research is unique in that it links memory encoding to hippocampal activation. Ghetti was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0009356mcq2d1tp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After a momentary delay, the babies were then shown two images side by side: one of familiar images they had seen before and one that was new. Researchers tracked the babies’ eye movements, noting which image they focused on longer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi000a356m5exf4vug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If an infant spent more time looking at the familiar image, it suggested they recognized it, indicating memory recall. If they didn’t show any preference, it likely meant their memory was less developed, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi000b356m3jpod1ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Eye movements have been used in hundreds of studies on infant memory and  categorization,” Ghetti said via email. “Infants look at what they find interesting, and researchers have long leveraged this spontaneous behavior to derive information about memory functioning.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2jioi0000356m6c6djnu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once they collected the initial data, the team analyzed fMRI scans of babies who looked at the familiar image longer, comparing them with those who had no preference. Trials were excluded if the baby wasn’t focused on the screen and moved or blinked excessively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000l356mm2f4iqht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings revealed that the hippocampus was more active in older infants when encoding memories. Additionally, only older infants exhibited activity in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15134840/" target="_blank"&gt;orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a key role in memory-related decision-making and recognition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000m356mwdwbfcr1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One thing we have learned about memory in adults is that the information we tend to capture and encode into memory are things that are highly relevant to our experience,” said Dr. Lila Davachi, a professor in the department of psychology at Columbia University, who was not involved in the study. “The amazing thing about this study is convincingly showing hippocampal encoding processes in babies for stimuli that are, in some sense, unimportant to them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000n356mimym7cw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though it’s still unclear why memory encoding seems to be stronger in babies more than 12 months old, it’s likely a result of major alterations taking place in the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000o356mi234e78e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The infant brain undergoes many perceptual, linguistic, motor, biological and other changes around this time, including the rapid anatomical growth of the hippocampus,” Turk-Browne said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000p356mkyq1i3wf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Turk-Browne and his team are actively working to test why the brain is unable to retrieve these early memories in life, but he speculates that the brain processing in infants may suggest the hippocampus isn’t receiving the accurate “search terms” to find the memory as it was stored based on the experiences the baby was having at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kwml000j356m9trz9z7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ghetti encourages parents to think about the impact infancy has on their children, even if the children can’t retrieve memories they experienced at such an early age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000y356mxipkbbdg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies are learning an enormous amount at this age, which is how they begin to take in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an entire language by associating sounds with meanings, Ghetti said. She added that infants are also forming expectations around their family members and studying properties of objects and the world around them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000z356masojst20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents often see this learned behavior when they sing the same song or read the same book, which Davachi&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;noted produces a familiar response in older children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0010356mf34dp69l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Using repetition with babies will open up a greater connection between parent and baby,” she said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0011356mc4pdm3l0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though you can’t recall those earliest memories as an adult, it’s fair to say that you’re learning from those experiences, which can be true for both neutral and emotional information, Ghetti said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0012356mdwfd7362@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This can remind parents that infancy is not idle&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;time&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and that infants are learning a great deal,” Ghetti said. “Offering opportunities for visual exploration may be important for cultivating learning skills.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas health department said just two of the cases are in vaccinated people, with the remainder of the 277 sick patients being unvaccinated or having an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are some 301 cases in the U.S. so far this year, the CDC reported last week, surpassing the 285 measles cases recorded in the entirety of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, which has the second-highest number of measles cases in the country, Lea County is home to 36 of the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" aria-label="38 confirmed measles cases"&gt;38 confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt;, and is about 47 miles from Gaines County, Texas, where the majority of Texas’ measles cases have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The spread of measles recently increased in Kansas, where the state’s &lt;a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" aria-label="health department"&gt;health department&lt;/a&gt; has reported six cases so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where In Texas Is The Measles Outbreak?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 191 of the measles cases are located in Gaines County, a rural area about an hour-and-a-half west of Lubbock. The remaining cases are in Terry County (36), Dawson County (11), Yoakum County (11), Dallam County (6), Martin County (3), Lubbock County (5), Ector County (2) and Lynn County (2). Measles cases not associated with the larger outbreak in West Texas include cases in Harris County (3), Lamar County (2), Rockwall County (1) and Travis County (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Age Groups Is The Measles Outbreak Impacting In Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 120 of the cases have been among people aged five to 17, while 88 cases were among children between the ages of zero and four and 52 were reported among adults aged 18 and above. The ages of 19 patients have not been stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/fbs-ad&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a fever, rash, cough, fatigue, runny nose and red eyes. The symptoms do not appear until 10 to 14 days after someone is exposed to the virus and can appear as late as 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Contagious Is Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can spread from one person to nine out of 10 people close to them, according to the CDC, which notes a person infected with measles can spread it to others four days before through four days after the rash appears. Measles can spread through coughing, sneezing and infected surfaces and linger in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after infected people leave a given area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Is The Isolation Protocol For Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles should isolate for four days after they develop a rash, with the day of rash onset being considered day zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Measles Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." aria-label="highly effective and safe"&gt;highly effective and safe&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which has been available for over half a century, is about 97% effective at preventing measles with the standard two doses and 93% effective with one dose. The vaccine is typically given to people when they are children, with one dose administered between 12 to 15 months and another administered between four to six years old. The vaccine generally provides long-term or lifelong protection. There is no problem with getting the vaccine if you are an adult unsure of their vaccination status, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" aria-label="NPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. Adults born after 1957 and vaccinated before 1968 should consider getting revaccinated, NPR reported, noting early measles vaccines are not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Has Rfk Jr. Said About The Measles Outbreak And Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After claiming the outbreak is “not unusual,” Kennedy changed his stance and considered it “serious,” saying in a March 3 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" aria-label="statement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; “the measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health.” Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" aria-label="vaccine skeptic"&gt;vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, said vaccines contribute to community immunity, but did not explicitly tell people to get vaccinated and noted the “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.” He also supported the use of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician to treat people with mild, moderate, and severe infection, creating concerns among health experts who have cautioned about the vitamin’s effectiveness. Sue Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" aria-label="The Washington Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that solely relying on vitamin A instead of the MMR vaccine is “dangerous and ineffective” and can put children at risk, noting too much vitamin A can “cause serious health problems, including liver damage.” Meanwhile, advocacy non-profit Children’s Health Defense, which was founded and once chaired by RFK Jr., has attacked the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" aria-label="quoted skeptics"&gt;quoted skeptics&lt;/a&gt; who claimed measles was “an insignificant inconvenience until we turned it into a literal neurological damage nightmare through the MMR vaccine campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Crucial Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities,” according to The Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas measles outbreak began in late January with just two cases and has become the state’s largest outbreak of the virus in 30 years. The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" aria-label="report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of student immunization status for the 2023-2024 school year that 5.64% of Texas kindergarten students were not vaccinated for measles, while 2.34% of seventh graders had not received the vaccine. Measles was fully eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the virus was not spreading within the country and new cases only came from people who contracted measles abroad and returned to the U.S. In 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported across 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="stph_caption"&gt;Simple dietary changes appear to reduce people's risk of developing tinnitus, researchers reported in The BMJ. Adobe stock/HealthDay&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
		
		&lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowering the volume on earbuds or wearing earplugs in noisy environments is known to reduce a person's risk of &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/health-news/conditions/1-in-10-americans-has-experienced-ringing-in-the-ears-713127.html" target="_blank"&gt;tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, new research suggests that eating more fruit and fiber or drinking more milk and coffee may also stave off the vexing and persistent buzzing that can drive folks to distraction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple dietary changes appear to reduce people's risk of developing tinnitus, researchers reported in &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-091507" target="_blank"&gt;The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Diet-based strategies for tinnitus prevention are anticipated to play a significant role in chronic tinnitus management," the research team led by senior researcher &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qinxiu-Zhang" target="_blank"&gt;Qinxiu Zhang&lt;/a&gt; with the Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Sichuan, China, concluded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Existing evidence suggests that consuming fruit, dietary fiber, caffeine and dairy may be associated with a reduced incidence of tinnitus," researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in every six (14%) adults has tinnitus, researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although exposure to loud noise is a key risk factor for the hearing problem, "the origins of tinnitus remain elusive and involve a range of factors," researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the evidence review, researchers pooled data from eight previous studies that looked at potential links between tinnitus and diet. The studies involved more than 300,000 people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that increased consumption of certain foods reduced tinnitus risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Fruits by 35%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Dairy by 17%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Caffeine by 10%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Fiber by 9%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These foods might influence tinnitus risk by providing the body with specific nutrients that protect hearing health, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, caffeine might promote the release of hormones that protect nerves related to hearing, researchers said, while fruit and fiber might keep blood sugar level and prevent potentially damaging inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The primary underlying mechanisms may involve the protective effects of these diets on blood vessels and nerves, as well as their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties," researchers added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, it is crucial to interpret our findings cautiously because of the overall low quality of the evidence available."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review did not find any evidence for other foods that might potentially lower tinnitus risk, such as chocolate, vegetables, eggs, meat or fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies included in the review also could not support a dose-response relationship between these foods and tinnitus, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, eating tons of fruit or imbibing lots of caffeine will not necessarily produce ever-increasing protection against tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A separate &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7669595/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from 2021 showed that women also face higher rates of anxiety, PTSD and anorexia. As someone with both an autoimmune disease and anxiety, I found this information fascinating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as if the TikTok algorithm had read my thoughts, I was served a video titled “unprocessed anger is making you sick.” It got me wondering, could a major factor behind these statistics be not just &lt;a href="/news/ap-stanford-university-washington-rna-dna-b2488953.html"&gt;biological&lt;/a&gt; but behavioural? Specifically, could suppressed anger be contributing to women’s declining health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many women, I’ve struggled with expressing anger. Therapy has helped me recognise how deeply ingrained this issue is – women are conditioned to self-silence, to be caretakers while keeping quiet and polite. Anger, in particular, is seen as a masculine emotion, but it’s something we all experience and should be able to express in healthy, regulated ways. When we don’t express it, does it then manifest in our bodies as illness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, psychologist &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://cedar.wwu.edu/fairhaven_facpubs/14/"&gt;Dana Jack&lt;/a&gt; identified a pattern among her female patients: a tendency for “self-silencing”, suppressing needs, pleasing others and avoiding conflict. She linked this behaviour to a heightened risk of depression. More recently, a study from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11479187/"&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; found that suppressed anger in women of colour correlated with a 70 per cent increased risk of atherosclerosis, raising their risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that bottled-up anger can affect physical health resonates with many women. Sarah, 37, from London, was diagnosed with pernicious anaemia at 21 after struggling with anorexia. Later, at 34, she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia following multiple emotional and physical traumas. “A recurring theme was the overwhelming sense that I wasn’t being heard,” she says. “The more I fought for support, the less I received, leading me to retreat into silence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The anger I felt – toward friends, family, perpetrators and society – had nowhere to go. It settled in my body, manifesting as pain in my gut, chest, shoulders and throat. I realised this pain was somatic, a physical manifestation of unprocessed emotions. To release it, I turned to ecstatic dance, massage, diaphragmatic breathing, body scanning and grounding techniques. Sometimes, after an intense session, I cry and physically feel the trapped emotion leaving my body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Sarah actively practices these tools to prevent both old and new pain from accumulating. “If I don’t, my body shuts down; widespread pain, skin sensitivity (allodynia), headaches, jaw tension, extreme fatigue, &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/memoractiv-brain-fog-supplements-b2638539.html" title="I tried the brain fog supplements recommended by Karlie Kloss – here’s what happened"&gt;memory fog&lt;/a&gt; and emotional instability. While my fibromyalgia specialist prescribes painkillers, physiotherapy and homeopathic medicine, we both agree that physical somatic action is the best way to manage my condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/hypnotherapy-anxiety-b2689797.html" title="I tried hypnotherapy to cure my anxiety and noticed results after just one session"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tried hypnotherapy to cure my anxiety and noticed results after just one session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress and the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dilly, 29, also from London, has Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, slowing down metabolism. “I experience muscle pain, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/thinning-hair-loss-balding-how-to-volume-style-b2709263.html" title="Here’s why your hair is thinning – and what you can do about it"&gt;hair loss&lt;/a&gt;, cold intolerance and dry skin. My &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/what-is-kombucha-b2718177.html" title="I’ve been drinking kombucha for years and it’s transformed my gut health – here’s how"&gt;gut slows down&lt;/a&gt;, leading to weight gain, but worst of all, it affects my mood and energy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her symptoms worsened after a particularly stressful year involving personal and work-related issues. “That’s when I finally sought medical advice and was diagnosed. My GP suspected my thyroid had been under active for years without me realising it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dilly, who is currently training to be a doctor, has found little time to process her diagnosis or emotions. “My GP was nonchalant when they told me, which made me question my own anxiety around taking lifelong medication. I suppressed my feelings, and I believe it negatively impacted my health. Recently, I had to increase my dosage despite stable levels for three months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts believe there is a connection between suppressed emotions and physical illness. &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.drbrighten.com/"&gt;Dr Jolene Brighten&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified naturopathic endocrinologist, explains, “Suppressing emotions, particularly anger, has been linked to increased stress, dysregulated immune function and chronic inflammation, which may contribute to the development or worsening of autoimmune diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She points to research showing that emotional repression can trigger prolonged activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to immune system dysfunction. This can worsen conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 ceuKtN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/20/16/52/iStock-918812934.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/20/16/52/iStock-918812934.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/20/16/52/iStock-918812934.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Some experts believe that high stress levels can affect the immune system, leading to chronic health issues" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-42543"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Some experts believe that high stress levels can affect the immune system, leading to chronic health issues&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the_health_psychologist_/?hl=en"&gt;Dr Sula Windgassen&lt;/a&gt;, a Health Psychologist, CBT Therapist and EMDR Therapist, notes that health is inherently biopsychosocial – shaped by biological, psychological, social and environmental factors. “When addressing health or illness, we must consider all three aspects together rather than in isolation.” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some studies suggest emotional suppression may be linked to immune system dysfunction, Windgassen cautions that research is still evolving. “There haven’t been enough studies specifically on suppressed anger and its effects on &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/immunity-vitamins-flu-season-b2661357.html" title="These are the supplements you should take for flu season"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt;. However, psychoneuroimmunology research provides compelling evidence that emotional suppression can impact immune functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/health-and-wellbeing/sleep-insomnia-women-health-b2678733.html" title="Mind the sleep gap: Why no one ever notices when women are exhausted"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind the sleep gap: Why no one ever notices when women are exhausted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The body’s response to suppression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All emotions are biologically mediated through brain activity, autonomic nervous system changes, and hormonal secretion. However, no single physiological signature corresponds to a specific emotion like anger or sadness. Windgassen explains, “It’s not that emotions themselves are harmful, it’s how we respond to them that can put strain on the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppression, she says, is one of the most depleting responses. It activates higher-order brain regions, like the prefrontal cortex, while decreasing activation in emotion-processing centres like the amygdala. This leads to increased cortisol secretion, which can disrupt immune function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cortisol can both inhibit immune responses, making the system slow to react, or over activate it, leading to inflammation, a sign of immune dysfunction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research continues, the growing body of evidence suggests that suppressing emotions, including anger, may have significant physiological consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding healthy outlets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what can women do to prevent emotional suppression from affecting their health? Dr Brighten suggests developing emotional awareness and expression through journaling, therapy, or somatic practices. “Engaging in regular physical activity, mindfulness and &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/breathing-exercises-stress-anxiety-b2676660.html" title="An expert says you should be doing these four breathing exercises every day"&gt;breathwork&lt;/a&gt; can help regulate the nervous system and reduce the physiological impact of suppressed anger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also emphasises the importance of setting boundaries, cultivating assertive communication, and fostering supportive relationships. “Expressing anger in constructive ways can help reduce the stress-related risks of immune dysfunction and inflammation.” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah and Dilly’s experiences reflect what research and experts suggest – that unprocessed emotions can manifest physically, contributing to chronic health conditions. Whether through therapy, movement or mindfulness, properly acknowledging and processing your emotions – especially anger – may be a crucial step in maintaining both mental and physical health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-avoid-burnout-b2668054.html" title="How to spot the symptoms of burnout and treat them, according to wellbeing experts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to spot the symptoms of burnout and treat them, according to wellbeing experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNaFdkT09zVXE1WVctVW1uRzhUZ2NfNWhGTTFOQ01DRmVvWER4ZDhaalIzd3lqa3puNUFnbXZHQV9ULXRTYVVyT2VDVXcybldMODJRMmFFOUZNOG9hMTl2aXhBYk5EcFdmTlVKQnVCRzZ4Y0VEUmV4TEdNT3h5LWM4Mzd4T3VHSjh3d0NDUUtaNG0</guid></item><item><title>6 Kansans under age 18 test positive for measles: KDHE - KAKE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNRERaQU4xZE53NWlibXQ5dWFMZ0tyMGtMZ0FpX3pSOGZtazZaeXlsUHNWTVgxcmlPT2NoWnBtRjBnYXFPR01nRl9TOUNVNVFFTnVEWVJQQ1kzY0ljMGx3TDM2aGhESzBxYUphaWdDdk42SUxUSzNqX2JyUnpYend5ZzYxdGJFY21XYmV4TEFOUVNuMl9GNWFpdXQwYzc0bnhINEEtNlVpRS03LTIwTEw3SV8teG03bFE1Y2E4ajNlaWhYLUI0akFYaQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="form-group-flex"&gt;

This evolution, they caution, suggests that older vaccine formulas may lose effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows a trend of weakening binding affinity of existing antibodies against H5 isolates over time, indicating that the H5N1 virus is evolving immune escape from our therapeutic and immunological defenses,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rapid-shifts-in-bird-flu-virus"&gt;Rapid shifts in bird flu virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By running large-scale computational models of specific viral proteins binding with neutralizing antibodies, the research team discovered “an overall worsening in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/experts-have-found-powerful-antibodies-that-neutralize-all-covid-variants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; affinity to more recent H5N1 isolates.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If one makes an H5N1 vaccine with a previous vaccine candidate virus, the vaccine will have less efficacy, based on our measurements of how much the virus has evolved in recent years,” explained lead author Colby T. Ford, a visiting scholar at UNC Charlotte’s &lt;a href="https://cipher.charlotte.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Center for Computational Intelligence to Predict Health and Environmental Risks&lt;/a&gt; (CIPHER).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted under the guidance of assistant professor Richard Allen White III, and CIPHER co-director Daniel Janies, the UNC Charlotte team joined forces with &lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; (MIT) researchers Rafael Jaimes III and Phillip J. Tomezsko to explore how the H5N1 virus is adapting so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mounting-zoonotic-risk"&gt;Mounting zoonotic risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing 1,804 antigen-antibody interactions, the researchers examined how the virus’s hemagglutinin subunit changed from 1996 to 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By applying high-performance computational techniques, they tracked the virus’s “antigenic drift” – small cumulative mutations that hamper the effectiveness of immune defenses from earlier infections or vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new measurements of how much the bird flu virus has evolved in recent years confirmed that H5N1 is becoming less recognizable to established antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results indicate that the virus has potential to move from epidemic to pandemic status,” wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emergence-across-multiple-species"&gt;Emergence across multiple species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though H5N1 has primarily circulated in birds, it has jumped to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/avian-influenza-h5n1-marine-mammals-spreading-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt; and, rarely, to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past year, the virus was found in dairy cattle in at least 17 U.S. states, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) reported 70 human cases, including one fatality, in the United States since January 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, H5N1 has been linked to 466 human deaths since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between January 2022 and March 2025, the CDC also documented 12,510 H5N1 outbreaks among wild birds within the U.S., virus detections in 51 jurisdictions and 166,417,923 affected poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such widespread, cross-species infections strongly indicate that avian influenza can be considered a pandemic among animal populations, raising fears of a future human pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-birds-flu-vaccination-and-public-health"&gt;Birds flu vaccination and public health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In discussing how to avert the looming threat, the authors argue that a new approach to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/universal-influenza-vaccine-could-offer-lifetime-immunity/"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; development may be needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that once the bird flu virus modifies itself significantly, older vaccines will have less efficacy, making it essential to develop and regularly update H5N1 vaccines reflecting the virus’s continuous genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the study’s results highlight the power of high-performance computing in mapping viral evolution. By integrating AI-based protein folding with physics-based simulations, researchers can anticipate changes in viral structure and better inform policy decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bird-flu-s-potential-for-pandemic-status"&gt;Bird flu’s potential for pandemic status&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With H5N1 already widespread among wild birds and expanding its foothold in mammalian hosts, the virus’s cross-species jumps present a significant concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the experts, more robust monitoring, updated vaccination strategies, and ongoing computational analyses will be crucial in mitigating a potential outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Janies concluded, computational modeling can help experts “tune our intuition to the right approaches” for vaccine design and intervention strategies before a fast-adapting virus gains an uncontrollable edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:40:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNSTZadGNfdzk0QXhJOWFZWDdYdHNzZXEzVVAwRWZMOG5YY1dtemFWYVdGRWJDVFNZWkd1T1A0VVc4c1J6RUs4UXhWQkhJQXhZNUpRRHA3ZEFOMmhGOVc0VEwyQXVJS0xpVUN4dEV4RFVpc0dSY1lTM01Zc0wyWkF2b2lSNXlpdEtvX1pVMEREUVk</guid></item><item><title>Byron Mom In Murder-Suicide Had Depression, Anxiety Meds In System - Cowboy State Daily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNbnY0NTF6RVVqMURJUWllMUhzVno3a2pNWHZMTEM5OXRwUXdNUVgtX0REWWZ1Y1gxWG5BWFc4dGFKTjh6OUhLck9uejZrU1VyUDZkMXgzRGRwQWJMWlhsME0xejZ4MS11SmtvcHZfY1ZBbzctT1JadHZwcW9vTlE2bzRzWTFTTnZILTNDUVd1dUE1N3ItSnBaSXJ4THpVVWp6Rm40RjhJNkozZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="_1sy4yg80 _1t01cac0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Byron, Wyoming, woman who shot her four children then herself last month had both ketamine, a drug for post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and clonazepam — an anti-anxiety drug — in her system, the coroner’s office says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Big Horn County Coroner’s Office released relevant toxicology results and other details on Thursday about 32-year-old Tranyelle Harshman’s death to Cowboy State Daily after the outlet requested them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harshman suffered what &lt;a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/02/12/husband-of-woman-in-byron-murder-suicide-says-she-was-depressed-struggling/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;has been described as a mental health break&lt;/a&gt; Feb. 10 at her home in Byron, Wyoming.

He said he hopes the world will give him a chance to grieve – and he hopes the aberration now associated with his wife’s chemical mental health treatments won’t discourage other people from obtaining treatments that may work for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m bitter that this has had to continue to be a thorn in my side, when I need to just… grieve my family’s loss,” Cliff said. “I also want people to understand that this isn’t a chance to demonize different therapies. This works for a lot of different people. This was her last grasp at the rope, if you will, to hang on.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cliff Harshman remembers his wife as a loving mother and devoted life partner. He told the outlet that, like the children’s passing, Tranyelle’s death was a loss to him too.

NIH-funded study uses cutting-edge imaging techniques to reconstruct features underlying learning and memory in the mouse brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), researchers revealed the structural underpinnings of memory formation across a broad network of neurons in the mouse brain. This work sheds light on the fundamentally flexible nature of how memories are made, detailing learning-related changes at the cellular and subcellular levels with unprecedented resolution. Understanding this flexibility may help explain why memory and learning processes sometimes go awry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, showed that neurons assigned to a memory trace reorganized their connections to other neurons through an atypical type of connection called a multi-synaptic bouton. In a multi-synaptic bouton, the axon of the neuron relaying the signal with information contacts multiple neurons that receive the signal.  According to the researchers, multi-synaptic boutons may enable the cellular flexibility of information coding observed in previous research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that neurons involved in memory formation were not preferentially connected with each other. This finding challenges the idea that “neurons that fire together wire together,” as would be predicted by a traditional theory of learning.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers observed that neurons allocated to a memory trace reorganized certain intracellular structures that provide energy and support communication and plasticity in neuronal connections. These neurons also had enhanced interactions with support cells known as astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of advanced genetic tools, 3D electron microscopy, and artificial intelligence, Scripps Research scientists Marco Uytiepo, Anton Maximov, Ph.D., and colleagues reconstructed a wiring diagram of neurons involved in learning and identified structural changes to these neurons and their connections at the cellular and subcellular levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To examine structural features associated with learning, the researchers exposed mice to a conditioning task and examined the hippocampus region of the brain about 1 week later. They selected this time point because it occurs after memories are first encoded but before they are reorganized for long-term storage. Using advanced genetic techniques, the researchers permanently labeled subsets of hippocampal neurons activated during learning, which enabled reliable identification. They then used 3D electron microscopy and artificial intelligence algorithms to produce nanoscale reconstructions of the excitatory neural networks involved in learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study provides a comprehensive view of the structural hallmarks of memory formation in one brain region. It also raises new questions for further exploration. Future studies will be crucial in determining whether similar mechanisms operate across different time points and neural circuits. In addition, further investigation into the molecular composition of multi-synaptic boutons is needed to determine their precise role in memory and other cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by funding from the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies&lt;/em&gt;® Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative®.&lt;/p&gt;
