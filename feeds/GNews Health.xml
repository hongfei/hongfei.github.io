These are mathematical calculations, so they don’t necessarily represent what’s typical or healthy for you as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many factors that make our bodies unique — our size, our shape, our proportions — that comparing ourselves to others is rarely helpful. In fact, doing so often leads to negative self-talk and other harmful behaviors (thanks, social me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it might be helpful to know you’re not the only one thinking about your weight. According to a nationally-representative survey conducted by Hims &amp;amp; Hers, 83 percent of Americans say they are not the weight they’d like to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average amount of weight folks are looking to lose? 42 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn more about the average weight for women in the United States, what women believe the ideal weight is, and the factors that influence your ability to hit your goal weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Drazen Zigic/Istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Ideal Weight, According to Women&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how Americans think about weight and weight loss, Hims &amp;amp; Hers conducted a nationally-representative &lt;a href="https://www.hims.com/forhims/image/upload/v1726056665/reports/The_Shape_of_America_Report_Final_2024.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 5,000 adults. We learned a lot about the often contradictory beliefs we hold about weight, including what we believe is normal for our own weight and the weight of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey found that women believe the ideal weight for women is 139 pounds. But when asked about their personal ideal weight, the answers changed. When speaking about themselves, the average goal weight for women reported by women in this study was 144 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's up with these discrepancies? According to Dr. Jessica Shepherd, chief medical officer at Hers, there are a few factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Body image is a multifaceted construct which includes positive and negative attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors," she says. "There can be discrepancies between actual and ideal weights due to gender, ethnicity, genetics, environment, and lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Rostislav_Sedlacek/Istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Average Weights Around the World&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;American women tend to weigh more than women in other parts of the world.

It’s calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters, squared. (kg/m2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not a perfect system of measurement, this simple calculation is used as a standard way to measure where you fall in comparison to “normal,” which in this context more or less means “healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMI is intended to provide insight into whether you have an increased risk of developing weight-related conditions, like hypertension (high blood pressure), &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/conditions/dyslipidemia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical community uses BMI values to diagnose conditions like obesity.

Many variables can affect our waistlines, and they can come into play at different points in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these factors include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hormones&lt;/b&gt;. Changes in estrogen and progesterone levels throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause can affect &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5850121/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolism and weight regulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolism and weight regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genetics&lt;/b&gt;. Genes can influence body composition, like where we tend to hang onto fat, and even how quickly we burn calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nutrition&lt;/b&gt;. Eating habits, the nutritional quality of our diets, and portion sizes impact weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physical activity&lt;/b&gt;. Cardio and strength training affect calorie expenditure, muscle mass, and overall body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stress&lt;/b&gt;. Chronic stress can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/guides/how-to-stop-emotional-eating" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emotional eating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emotional eating&lt;/a&gt;, hormonal imbalances, and changes in appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleep&lt;/b&gt;. Poor sleep quality can disrupt hormone levels, metabolism, and appetite regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medical conditions&lt;/b&gt;. Certain health conditions like PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), thyroid disorders, and &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/conditions/insulin-resistance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; can affect weight regulation in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medications&lt;/b&gt;. Medications like antidepressants, birth control pills, and corticosteroids may cause weight fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Social and cultural factors&lt;/b&gt;. Our eating habits are partly shaped by societal norms, cultural attitudes toward food, and peer or familial influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental health&lt;/b&gt;. Emotional well-being, self-esteem, and coping mechanisms all play a role in weight maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your age group, height, race, and ethnicity can also impact your weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Prostock-Studio/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 Tips for Healthy Weight Management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy weight management is a lifelong process. Your lifestyle habits are essential to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight and reducing your risk of weight-related health problems like &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/conditions/obesity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease. So toss the weight chart in the trash and consider these tips instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a goal to aim for, a healthcare provider can let you know what a healthy weight range would be for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Focus on Nutrients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition is one of the most important components of your overall health and wellness. Not only does a nutrient-rich diet provide the vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, and macronutrients (&lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/how-much-protein-eat-lose-weight" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, fats, and carbs) your body needs to thrive, but it also supports healthy weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat mostly whole foods&lt;/b&gt;. These include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and other lean proteins. This mix provides an array of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and they’re rich in &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/fiber-for-weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which helps you feel full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minimize ultra-processed foods&lt;/b&gt;. Examples include soda, candy, and packaged snack foods. These tend to be high in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on nutrients versus calories&lt;/b&gt;. Rather than being laser-focused on counting calories, put nutrients first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ladanifer/Istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Get Better Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting enough sleep will wreck anyone’s day, and things can go downhill fast if this is an ongoing problem. Sleep deprivation does more than just make you cranky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of sleep makes us more prone to sugar cravings and mindless eating. Experts say adults should get &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29073412/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seven to nine hours;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seven to nine hours&lt;/a&gt; of quality sleep per night. If you don’t normally sleep very well, try these tips to catch more Zzz’s:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow a consistent sleep-wake schedule, meaning you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopt a calming nighttime routine you can look forward to each evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dress in breathable PJs and use comfy bedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid screens close to bedtime, as the blue light can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9424753/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interfere with melatonin production;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;interfere with melatonin production&lt;/a&gt; and make it harder to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use black-out curtains or a white noise machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you have &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/conditions/sleep-apnea" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;JLco - Julia Amaral/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Move Your Body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is important for supporting your overall health and achieving your weight goals. Regular exercise helps you burn extra calories, lose weight, and put on muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For general health, experts recommend at least &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:150 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;150 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise weekly, plus strength training twice per week. For weight loss goals, this increases to 200 to 300 minutes per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/steps-a-day-lose-weight" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:getting your steps in;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;getting your steps in&lt;/a&gt;, here are a few things to try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swimming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jogging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing martial arts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing basketball&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining a group fitness class&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interval training (HIIT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using resistance bands, dumbbells, or weight machines, or doing bodyweight exercises&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;KucherAV/ iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Consider Weight Loss Medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When daily lifestyle habits alone aren’t enough to promote weight loss, many people find success with &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/weight-loss-medication" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss medications&lt;/a&gt;. Intended to be used alongside a healthy diet and exercise, some of the most popular and effective weight loss medications include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists&lt;/b&gt;. These work by mimicking the effects of the naturally occurring hormone GLP-1, which regulates appetite and food intake. By activating GLP-1 receptors in your brain, GLP-1s help promote fullness, slow digestion, and decrease cravings. Examples include liraglutide (Saxenda) and &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/weight-loss/compounded-semaglutide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:semaglutide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; (Wegovy or Ozempic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metformin&lt;/b&gt;. Metformin is primarily used to improve blood sugar regulation in those with type 2 diabetes, but it may also support weight loss by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6520185/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:decreasing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;decreasing&lt;/a&gt; appetite and reducing the absorption of glucose from food in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contrave&lt;/b&gt;. This is a combination of bupropion (an antidepressant and aid to quit smoking) and naltrexone (used for alcohol and opioid dependence). Bupropion helps reduce appetite and cravings, while naltrexone counteracts the effects of certain brain chemicals involved in food reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Topiramate&lt;/b&gt;. Topiramate is often used as an antiepileptic medication, but it can support weight loss by suppressing appetite and promoting feelings of fullness. It may also influence your brain's reward pathways, potentially reducing cravings for high-calorie foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ridofranz/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Nurture Social Connections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were never meant to do life alone, and this includes the journey to achieving a healthy weight. Social connections provide support, accountability, and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37698801/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that people who have these types of networks experience better weight loss outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining a group fitness community or jogging with friends builds a sense of community and encouragement, making it easier to stay committed to &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/healthy-eating-habits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy habits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a strong social network can help provide outlets for healthier stress management.

If your goal is weight loss, drink water right before or during meals to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4901052/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:help promote fullness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;help promote fullness&lt;/a&gt; and prevent overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get tired of plain water, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ridofranz/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding the Healthiest Weight for You&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summing it up, the average weight for women in the U.S. is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:170.8 pounds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;170.8 pounds&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn’t mean this is the ideal weight for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there’s no “ideal” weight calculation that considers every woman’s body type or health requirements. And at the end of the day, health is more than a number on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While unrealistic beauty standards and societal pressures are pervasive, that doesn’t mean we have to accept them as the norm when examining the optimal weight range for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re on a mission to find the healthiest weight for you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritize healthy everyday habits&lt;/b&gt;. This means improving sleep, staying hydrated, nourishing your social connections, boosting your nutrition, and moving your body regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seek outside support&lt;/b&gt;. Friends and family can be excellent support systems, but sometimes professional health experts can offer invaluable guidance. Perhaps it makes sense for you to talk to a dietitian or connect with one of our licensed healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on you.&lt;/b&gt; Weight management is personal.

While he takes three of them - turmeric, saffron, and garlic - as pills every day, you should consult your doctor before taking any new supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to DailyMail.com, Dr. Aziz said: 'Of course, you can't just have the spices - you have to eat the greens and avoid the chemicals and all the ultra-processed foods too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But spices are the anti-aging add-ons. They are like the superstars, the supernovas, for combatting aging.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details Dr. Aziz's favorite supplements.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Michael Aziz reveals how to reset the biological clock and improve your health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Turmeric: Boost muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Famous for its earthy flavor and orange-yellow color, turmeric is a staple in many Southeastern Asian dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rhizome (a root-like underground stem) contains the compound curcumin, which scientists say can help slash levels of inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several reviews have also suggested curcumin 'improves muscular performance' and helps them to recover after vigorous exercise - linking this to its anti-inflammatory effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above image shows a variety of turmeric spices, which are said to contain anti-inflammatory properties &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One&lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00812-6"&gt; 2017 research study from&lt;/a&gt;, which administered turmeric oil to mice, also concluded the spice has anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The papers suggest people consume one to four grams of curcumin - at least 33 grams of turmeric or 11 teaspoons worth - per day to achieve these benefits. Or, you can take curcumin supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Turmeric has previously been held up as a possible treatment for the 53 million adults in the US who suffer from arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the Arthritis Foundation pushed back against the claims, saying it&lt;span&gt; 'only contains about two to six percent curcumin, so you're not getting much [of the anti-inflammatory effect].'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The group explained that simply adding turmeric to your favorite meal would do little as the curcumin levels would be so low. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, it is a must-have in Aziz's longevity kitchen. He consumes it daily either in pill form or as a shot or small juice drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Garlic: Wrinkle eradicator&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Garlic is one of eight spices Dr. Michael Aziz claims can help you live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garlic is considered to be a superfood worldwide, with many experts suggesting it can lower inflammation, blood pressure and boost the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz suggests the allium can be used to help prevent wrinkles, though Brooklyn-based Dr. Mert Erogul and others remain skeptical about the claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says that garlic contains a compound called allicin, which contains sulfur. Sulfur plays a key role in creating and maintaining collagen, which keeps the skin elastic and firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erogul told DailyMail.com, 'It is a significant leap to assert that garlic can prevent wrinkles ... even if there's some theoretical justification for the claim. Although, to be clear, I am not sure that there is in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultimately, the only way we can know whether these claims are true is by putting them to the test - definitive proof that a substance has a specific health effect typically requires costly and extensive controlled trials.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz takes a garlic pill every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Aziz also recommended cinnamon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon is a favorite spice used for flavoring food and drinks, but it's also been revered by many communities for centuries because of its medicinal properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists believe cinnamaldehyde - a compound found in the oils of the dried plant - is responsible for much of the spice's health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon is high in antioxidants, and has also been linked to reducing triglycerides, cholesterol, and blood sugar, according to studies reviewed by &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-cinnamon#TOC_TITLE_HDR_5"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr. Aziz believes it may reduce the risk of someone developing Alzheimer's disease - he pointed to a &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043661817311659"&gt;few lab studies&lt;/a&gt; showing cinnamon could prevent the formation of tau proteins, which form clumps in the brain - there is no evidence to support it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists say more research is needed, and Dr. Erogul described the claim as another 'significant leap.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Ginger &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ginger is packed with nutrients that Dr. Aziz claims can reduce inflammation in the brain &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ginger is popular for its anti-nausea effects and has also been used medicinally for centuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some people may experience side effects after consuming either fresh or dried ginger, its compounds are generally known to have positive effects on digestion and the ability to settle an upset stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ginger-for-nausea#effectiveness"&gt;Healthline reports&lt;/a&gt; there are certain groups of people (those with gallbladder disease, people who are pregnant and have a history of miscarriage, anyone taking blood thinners, and more) who should be cautious and consult with their doctors when deciding whether to consume ginger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz says he always orders a ginger shot whenever he visits his local juice bar, but does not consume it every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He suggests it can help prevent mental decline, but experts say more research is needed, and that its mental health benefits have not yet been proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Ginseng&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found that the Ginseng plant (pictured) contains 50 types of ginsenosides - the compound linked to boosted health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ginseng has been used in Chinese medicine for more than 100 years, and is credited with a wide range of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Made from the roots of the ginseng plant, scientists found it contains 50 types of ginsenosides - compounds linked to boosted health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mount Sinai in New York compiled a long list of ailments the root may be able to help alleviate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The healthcare organization also said there is 'some evidence' Asian ginseng can help boost the immune system, reduce the risk of cancer, and improve mental performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American ginseng contains the same components but in different amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1226845324000344"&gt;2024 review&lt;/a&gt; found older adults taking American ginseng had improved cognition, especially when it was taken alongside early Alzheimer's drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16566675/"&gt;a 2006 study&lt;/a&gt; found that COLD-FX, a dietary supplement that contains extract of North American ginseng, could reduce the risk of catching a cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But scientists cautioned these were only preliminary findings and that more research is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz believes the root 'can help lower [blood] sugar levels, lower cholesterol, promote relaxation, improves sexual dysfunction in men, and is used to treat a wide range of medical conditions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Cardamom&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Antioxidants found in cardamom (pictured) could help to lower blood pressure, Dr. Aziz said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another ancient spice believed to have healing properties, cardamom is often added to curries, cookies, sweets, coffee, and spiced cakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz says it may be able to act as a blood pressure reducer, though Dr. Erogul said he wanted to see larger scale trials take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsn3.3738"&gt;2023 review&lt;/a&gt; found patients who took cardamom had significantly lower inflammation and blood pressure compared to those who did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review included more than 500 patients, who were mostly overweight or obese. Many had type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Saffron&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Saffron is extremely highly regarded in many cultures and has a huge presence in Persian and Middle Eastern foods. It's also expensive to buy, compared to the rest of the grocery store's spice rack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows saffron, which is from a crocus flower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it does not directly combat aging, Dr. Aziz said there is an established link between taking the spice and a better mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4643654/"&gt;A meta-analysis of five studies&lt;/a&gt; previously found saffron supplements were more effective than placebos at easing mild to moderate depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One paper claimed the spice is as effective as common antidepressants like fluoxetine - sold under the brand name Prozac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6503633/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20The%20findings%20of%20this,comparable%20with%20Fluoxetine%20and%20placebo."&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;included nearly 200 people who took saffron for six to 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In its conclusion, researchers said: 'The findings of this study showed that saffron administration was well comparable with Fluoxetine and placebo.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists said it may have these effects because the spice contains the compound crocin, which a 2022 review suggested can boost nerves in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added this could boost levels of the feel-good hormone serotonin, improving someone's mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz takes a saffron supplement every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Za'atar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Za'atar has been linked to anti-aging properties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This Middle Eastern spice blend varies by region, but often includes oregano, thyme, sesame seeds, and sumac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With its antioxidant levels, za'atar has been linked to a range of anti-aging properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oregano contains polyphenols like flavonoids, which can help to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thyme also contains substances that reduce inflammation - as does sumac, which is extremely high in antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464622000639#s0125"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found compounds in za'atar regulate the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It&lt;span&gt; is a 'blend of anti-aging weapons from all over the world,' Dr. Aziz says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Carrots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carrots are jam-packed with vitamin A, an important nutrient for vision, growth, cell division, reproduction and immunity, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-021-01063-3"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; that root vegetables are also filled with microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because plants absorb microplastics in water and soil through their roots, and the majority of these particles become concentrated in this part of the plant with only a tiny amount travelling up to the shoots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, leafy vegetables such as lettuces and cabbage contain lower amounts of microplastics compared to root vegetables such as carrots, radishes and turnips, according to one study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you want to reduce your microplastics intake by eating fewer carrots, but still want a healthy dose of vitamin A in your diet, try swapping them out for spinach or red, yellow and orange bell peppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;2. Plant-based nuggets  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study that tested different types of proteins for microplastic contamination found that plant-based nuggets contained the second-highest amount of plastic particles &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123022352"&gt;Researchers tested different types of proteins for microplastic contamination&lt;/a&gt;, and found that plant-based nuggets are one of the main culprits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the four different plant-based proteins they tested, the chicken nugget alternatives had the highest level of microplastics contamination at 0.32 particles per gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is due to the fact that these nuggets are highly processed and tend to be packaged in plastic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather than buying processed, packaged plant-based nuggets at the store, trying making them at home using tofu or seitan to reduce your plastic consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;3. Apples &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An apple a day keeps the doctor away, or so the saying goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this popular fruit actually contains more microplastics than any other, with one &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305703"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;finding they have more than 100,000 particles per gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like carrots, apple trees absorb microplastics through their roots, which ultimately find their way into the fruit they produce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you want a safer alternative, choose fruits that contain anthocyanins, a type of antioxidant that may protect the body against some of the harmful effects of microplastics, according to new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some examples of Anthocyanin-packed fruits include blueberries, cranberries, pomegranates and grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;4. Rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One study has shown that people consume three to four milligrams of plastic for every 100 grams of rice they eat, and instant rice is worse &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rice is a healthy source of carbohydrates, fiber and B vitamins. But eating it also gives you a dose of plastic contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://stories.uq.edu.au/news/2021/instant-rice-packs-a-plastic-punchinstant-rice-packs-a-plastic-punch/index.html"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;has shown that people consume three to four milligrams of plastic for every 100 grams of rice they eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when it comes to instant rice, that number jumps to 13 milligrams per serving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rice picks up plastic particles from the soil it grows in, the machines used to pick, store and move it, as well as the processing, packaging and handling it goes through before ending up on your plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found that washing rice before cooking it reduces plastic contamination by 20 to 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;5. Bottled water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This one will come as no surprise. Water packaged in plastic bottles is teeming with microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/plastic-particles-bottled-water#:~:text=The%20researchers%20found%20that%2C%20on,mostly%20focused%20on%20larger%20microplastics."&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that on average, a liter of bottled water contained about 240,000 plastic particles, and about 90 percent of them were nanoplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nanoplastics are 150 times smaller than a hair, and research suggests they are small enough to get inside human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fortunately, it's easy to eliminate plastic-bottled water from your life by purchasing a reusable water bottle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;6. Ready-to-eat salads&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It's difficult to pinpoint exactly how many microplastics are packed into these quick, light lunches, as they vary widely in terms of packaging, size and ingredients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like bottled water, the microplastic contamination in ready-to-eat salads stems from the packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's difficult to pinpoint exactly how many microplastics are packed into these quick, light lunches, as they vary widely in terms of packaging, size and ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But its inevitable that tiny pieces of the plastic packaging will shed into your salad. So if you want to avoid them, it's best to make your own salad using fresh, washed vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;7. Seafood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281596"&gt;recent study &lt;/a&gt;showed that the amount of microplastics in the ocean has been doubling every six years over the last four decades, and those particles make their way into our seafood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clams, mussels, crabs and nearly every type of fish are a few examples of seafoods that contain very high amounts of microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, one &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9819327/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20in%20European%20countries,still%20represents%20a%20considerable%20exposure%20%5B"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;estimated that people who eat large amounts of shellfish ingest about 11,000 microplastic particles each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unfortunately, there is not an easy swap for seafood, as microplastics can be found in practically every kind of fish and shellfish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But you can reduce your microplastics intake by cutting back on your seafood consumption and trying to avoid highly processed fish, such as frozen fish filets.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;8. Pink Himalayan sea salt &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Highly-processed American table salt is the safest option when it comes to microplastic contamination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pink Himalayan sea salt is widely considered healthy because it is minimally processed and therefore contains more minerals that the body needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But interestingly, researchers have found that processed salt contains far fewer microplastics than less processed salts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, one &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46173"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that highly-processed, conventional table salt in the US contained significantly fewer microplastics than minimally processed salts, such as those used in Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because unrefined salts contain plastic pollution from the oceans they are harvested from, and in this case, processing actually works to remove much of those microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pink Himalayan sea salt is especially high in microplastics both because it is unrefined and because of the mining methods used to extract it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thus, highly processed American table salt is the safest option when it comes to avoiding microplastic contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;9. Processed dairy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the exception of salt, highly processed foods generally contain more microplastics, and this is definitely true for conventional dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown that highly processed dairy products such as powdered cheese and conventional milk contain significantly more microplastics than minimally processed alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce your microplastics intake from dairy, reach for locally-sourced, organic milk, cheese and yoghurt at the store instead of the processed stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;10.  Tea in nylon bags &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nylon mesh tea bags release billions of micro- and nanoplastics into a single cup of tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nylon tea bags release tons of microplastics into your hot cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31552738/"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that steeping a single nylon mesh tea bag in 200°F water releases roughly 11.6 billion microplastics and 3.1 billion nanoplastics into a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using tea in paper tea bags, or loose leaf tea and a reusable stainless steel strainer, are much safer options when it comes to limiting microplastic exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;11. Seaweed &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just like seafood and sea salts, microplastics make their way into seaweed products too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These particles become trapped on the surface of seaweed, clinging to its tiny crevices and fibers. One &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030881462400966X"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that conventional washing methods are ineffective in removing most microplastics from seaweed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seaweed is eaten all over the world, but is a predominant staple of Asian diets. That same study found that people in China consume more than 17,000 microplastics per person per year through seaweed consumption alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That represents 13 percent of their total annual microplastics intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you love seaweed-wrapped sushi but want to cut down on your microplastics consumption, try making it with rice paper, lettuce or thinly-sliced cucumbers instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;12. Honey&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One study found that honey made in urban environments contained far more microplastics than honey made in rural environments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have tested honey from all over the world for microplastics, and found that this food staple is widely contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the microplastic pollution does not come from processing, but rather the bees themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When honeybees forage for pollen in polluted environments, they pick up plastic particles that eventually make their way into the honey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is likely why one &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://12ft.io/proxy"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that honey made in urban environments contained far more microplastics than honey made in rural environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, you can cut down on your plastic consumption by purchasing honey made in rural locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A contraceptive implant is a thin and flexible rod that sits under the skin and releases contraceptive drugs into the body for years. While it’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/choosing-contraception/how-well-it-works-at-preventing-pregnancy/"&gt;most effective forms of contraceptives&lt;/a&gt; and avoids the inconvenience of having to take a pill every day, the implant requires minor surgery, which can limit accessibility. To make life a bit easier, researchers are creating a self-assembling contraceptive implant the components of which women could self-administer with a single injection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers has developed the technology for self-injectable contraceptive shots that work similarly to contraceptive implants. As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-025-00194-x"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Monday in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering, the shots would result in a highly effective and long-term contraceptive method more accessible to women who lack easy access to medical infrastructure. Additionally, the design could be used to administer other long-term medications, such as those for HIV.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new approach delivers the contraceptive hormonal medication levonorgestrel via what the researchers call “Self-assembling Long-acting Injectable Microcrystals” (SLIM). Once injected into the body, the tiny crystals assemble into an implant, or a drug “depot,” that releases levonorgestrel as it erodes over months or years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="not-prose video-container"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;iframe title="Self-Aggregating Long-Acting Injectable Microcystals" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BnK_HjO76Jk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The overarching goal is to give women access to a lot of different formats for contraception that are easy to administer, compatible with being used in the developing world, and have a range of different timeframes of durations of action,” Vivian Feig, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University and co-author on the study, said in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/engineers-develop-better-way-to-deliver-long-lasting-drugs-0324"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Traditional &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/4086-depo-provera-birth-control-shot"&gt;birth control shots&lt;/a&gt; already exist and are more accessible than the contraceptive implant because patients can give themselves the shots without having to visit a hospital or medical clinic. However, they are slightly less effective than the implant and are not long-lasting, so they must be administered every three months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers’ new contraceptive design joins the accessibility of self-administered shots with the long-term efficacy of an implant. The challenge of self-administering technologies similar to SLIM, however, has been the large (and hence painful) needle size necessary to inject the medication. By contrast, the team’s formula—tiny crystals and a solvent (in this case a liquid compound called benzyl benzoate)—allows for the use of much smaller needles.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Needle size and liquid viscosity are crucial considerations for commercial translation of injectables,” said Giovanni Traverso, senior author of the study and a gastroenterologist at MIT and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in a Mass General Brigham &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/new-non-surgical-contraceptive-implant-delivered-through-tiny-needles"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Our engineering challenge was finding a way to maximize comfort for patients by using smaller needles, which cause less bruising or bleeding, and to make the viscosity low enough for easy application with the syringe by hand.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Traverso and his colleagues can modify the mixture to “modulate the drug release rate, extending its duration while maintaining injectability,” MIT graduate student Sanghyun Park explained in the MIT statement. “This demonstrates the tunability of our system, which can be engineered to accommodate a broader range of contraceptive needs as well as tailored dosing regimens for other therapeutic applications.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While SLIM hasn’t gone through clinical trials yet, the development of the technology in preclinical models paves the way for more convenient and effective future long-term medications.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; My childhood dream was to go to pastry school to create beautiful, delicious desserts. Over time, my interest in the role of nutrition on sports performance and overall health grew, leading me to my current role as a dietitian. Instead of laminating pastry dough and frosting cakes, I’ve been able to merge my passions by creating desserts with benefits—aka sweet treats packed with nutrient-dense ingredients.  But let’s be real: Life gets busy, and I don’t always have time to whip up desserts and snacks. That’s why I’ve been hooked on &lt;a href="https://www.naturaldelights.com/products/cacao-pecan-mini-medjools" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found right in the produce aisle.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These brownie-inspired date bites bring just the right combination of flavors and textures to the table: sweet, chocolaty, caramel-like, nutty, chewy and crunchy.  Craving a candy bar? The combination of a dense, chewy, caramel-like texture, rich, chocolaty flavor and satisfying crunch is sure to do the trick. Plus, this snack is made from just four simple ingredients and is free from added sugar and artificial additives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-square figure-high-res"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to filling power, some snacks just don’t cut it. But that’s not the case with these Mini Medjools. Each bite-size piece packs a trio of nutrients—complex carbs, protein and fiber—that work together to keep you full for longer and truly satisfied. Specifically, each four-piece serving provides 24 grams of carbohydrates, 5 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Blood Sugar–Friendly &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The snack’s combination of fiber and protein also helps to slow digestion, providing a steady release of sugar without causing large swings in your blood sugar levels. While you might worry that dates are off-limits if you have diabetes, they’re actually an incredibly nutrient-dense way to add sweetness without using added sugars. Plus, one review found that eating dates may actually help lower blood sugar levels, thanks to their high fiber content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Speaking of which, this chewy snack is packed with an impressive 5 grams of fiber per four-piece serving. In addition to minimizing blood sugar spikes and increasing satiety, fiber plays an important role in heart and digestive health. Specifically, dates are high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which helps prevent constipation and may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Provides Several Essential Nutrients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to fiber, these brownie-inspired bites contain numerous other important nutrients, largely thanks to their three main ingredients: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medjool dates &lt;/strong&gt;are a sweet source of complex carbohydrates, fiber and micronutrients like potassium, magnesium, folate, copper, calcium and iron.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pecans &lt;/strong&gt;are often overlooked except during the holidays (hello, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/276928/mini-pecan-pies/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pecan pie!&lt;/a&gt;). However, these buttery nuts provide heart-healthy unsaturated fats, fiber, plant-based protein and a wealth of micronutrients like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-consume-vitamin-e-regularly-8685814" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, copper and zinc.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cacao powder and nibs &lt;/strong&gt;are packed with antioxidants, specifically flavonols, which protect against cell damage and support heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Cacoa&lt;/a&gt; also contains fiber and micronutrients like magnesium and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Has Benefits for Your Heart &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A fiber-rich snack isn’t just good for digestion, it’s also good for your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8700225" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;. One study found that dates may improve heart health by lowering triglyceride, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and total cholesterol levels while boosting beneficial HDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The snack’s inclusion of cacao and pecans further boosts its heart-healthy benefits. For example, one study found that adults at risk for heart disease who swapped their usual snacks with pecans for 12 weeks saw meaningful reductions in cholesterol and triglyceride levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Meanwhile, cacao’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flavonoid&lt;/a&gt; content may help reduce chronic inflammation, lower triglyceride levels and improve blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  Snack time is a great opportunity to increase the amount of fiber in your diet; the key is knowing what to look for. Here are a few tips for choosing a nutritious, high-fiber snack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for 3 grams of fiber per serving or more&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifically, look for snacks containing at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. While some snacks are fortified, others contain natural fiber sources, like fruits, veggies, lentils, nuts, seeds and whole grains.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit added sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;Ideally, look for snacks that are naturally sweetened with fruit and limit those containing high amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912011/whats-the-big-deal-about-sugar-we-have-your-questions-answered/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugar.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to the ingredient list: &lt;/strong&gt;In general, snacks with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-fiber-snack-recipes-with-3-ingredients-or-less-8725256" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;short, simple ingredient lists&lt;/a&gt; are less likely to contain artificial additives or preservatives. They often tend to be lower in added sugar and unhealthy fats. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose whole grains: &lt;/strong&gt;Whole grain–based snacks are typically higher in fiber and other essential nutrients than their refined counterparts. Whole-grain crackers, oat-based granola bars and popcorn are all great &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898414/what-are-whole-grains/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;whole-grain&lt;/a&gt; options. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include protein&lt;/strong&gt;: The combination of protein and fiber can be especially helpful for satiety and managing blood sugar levels. Nuts, seeds, nut butters, trail mixes, edamame, roasted chickpeas and hummus are all great examples of foods offering this beneficial duo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for fruit- or vegetable-based options:&lt;/strong&gt; Fruits and vegetables are important sources of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Look for snacks that incorporate them in any form—fresh, frozen, dried or canned. For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8034765/a-month-of-veggie-packed-smoothies/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt; is a refreshing way to add a dose of both fruit and leafy greens, while fruit leathers and dehydrated veggie chips are good for taking on the go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  Next time you’re in the produce department, don’t forget to grab a container of Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools. Packed with fiber and with a wonderfully chewy consistency, this snack offers numerous health benefits in a small, yet satisfying package.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been five years since the start of a zoonotic COVID-19 pandemic that &lt;a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;killed millions of people&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the United Nations is urging member governments to take coordinated action to address &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the “unprecedented” spread of highly pathogenic bird flu&lt;/a&gt; — a threat to health, food security, biodiversity and more. The world has reached an inflection point, another chance to do what is needed to prevent a health crisis.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will either be remembered as the moment we failed to save lives or the moment we finally reckoned with the dangers of factory farming and our mass exploitation of animals. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The warning from the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization came on March 17, the same day the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-reported-first-outbreak-h7n9-bird-flu-farm-since-2017-woah-says-2025-03-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a new U.S. outbreak of dangerous H7N9 bird flu&lt;/a&gt; was reported. Since it first emerged in 2013, the strain has a nearly 40 percent mortality rate in humans, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/wpro-emergencies/surveillance/avian-influenza"&gt;translating to 616 human deaths&lt;/a&gt; in China. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite troubling signs that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/severe-bird-flu-cases-virus-can-mutate-lingers-body-rcna186009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the virus is mutating and could become more transmissible&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s $1 billion strategy to fight bird flu is &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trumps-plan-combat-bird-flu-will-ensure-more-bird-flu-opinion-2042335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;likely to create more danger,&lt;/a&gt; as the federal agency funnels $400 million into factory farms as reimbursements for chickens lost. In so doing, it is propping up the very industry fueling the spread of zoonotic disease.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since early 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nearly 170 million farmed birds have died or been killed&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. due to bird flu outbreaks, equivalent to roughly half the country’s human population. Just since last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;70 human cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported, the majority of which resulted from direct exposure to livestock. Three came from unknown sources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We already know that &lt;a href="https://www.emro.who.int/fr/about-who/rc61/zoonotic-diseases.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;75 percent of emerging human pathogens are zoonotic&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, by farming animals in the billions, we are playing with fire. Factory farms confine thousands of animals into unsanitary facilities, where workers are &lt;a href="https://investigatemidwest.org/2024/12/04/bird-flu-ppe-access-in-dairy-producing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;often left unprotected&lt;/a&gt; from disease.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While some have blamed wild birds for the presence of bird flu on large-scale farms, it is more likely that &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/can-wild-birds-spread-avian-influenza-domestic-poultry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;failures to prevent diseases from spreading on farms are the real culprits&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250224/Study-finds-strong-evidence-that-bird-flu-spreads-through-the-air-between-farms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ventilation systems on factory farms may be fueling airborne transmission&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu; &lt;a href="https://time.com/7212477/wastewater-testing-farms-bird-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientists are currently tracking&lt;/a&gt; wastewater from these intensive operations as a potential avenue for the virus’s spread. The hazards of factory farms themselves are compounded by the clearing of forests for animal agriculture, which diminishes planetary resilience and pushes humans and wildlife into &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/analysis-how-deforestation-helps-deadly-viruses-jump-from-animals-to-humans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ever closer contact and toward a higher risk of disease transmission&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than protecting the public, the U.S. government remains focused on bolstering corporations and lowering egg prices, which, according to a recent report, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/04/egg-prices-bird-flu-corporate-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;have likely been artificially inflated&lt;/a&gt; by agribusiness titans taking advantage of consumers. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As the USDA bails out animal agriculture and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggests that the nation &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;allow bird flu to spread through its poultry industry&lt;/a&gt;, it is critical that a country in which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;99 percent of all farmed animals are kept on factory farms&lt;/a&gt; begin taking this escalating threat seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600" alt="" class="wp-image-4329764" srcset="https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To protect the health of animals and humans, the Trump administration should quickly shift support away from factory farming in favor of a safer and more sustainable plant-based food system. Otherwise, we could be reflecting on an even deadlier pandemic five years from now.  &lt;/p&gt;

Now, researchers are proposing an enhanced metric, which combines the two using basic math: Divide your average daily heart rate by your daily average number of steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The resulting ratio — the daily heart rate per step, or DHRPS — provides insight into how efficiently the heart is working, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.036801" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;according to a study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by researchers at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University and published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The study found that people whose hearts work less efficiently, by this metric, were more prone to various diseases, including Type II diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, stroke, coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s a measure of inefficiency,” said Zhanlin Chen, a third-year medical student at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University and lead author of the new study; his coauthors included several Feinberg faculty physicians. “It looks at how badly your heart is doing,” he added. “You’re just going to have to do a tiny bit of math.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some experts said they saw wisdom in DHRPS as a metric. Dr. Peter Aziz, a pediatric cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, said it appeared to be an advance on the information provided by daily steps or average heart rate alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“What is probably more important for cardio fitness is what your heart does for the amount of work it has to do,” he said. “This is a reasonable way to measure that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The metric does not look at heart rate during exercise. But, Dr. Aziz said, it still provided an overall sense of efficiency that, importantly, was shown by researchers to have an association with disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The size of the study added validity to the findings, Dr. Aziz said. The scientists mapped Fitbit data from nearly 7,000 Smartwatch users against electronic medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Chen said that a simple way to grasp the value of the new metric was to compare two hypothetical individuals. Both take 10,000 steps a day, but one has an average daily resting heart rate of 80 — in the middle of the healthy range — while the other’s daily resting heart rate is 120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The first person would have a DHRPS of 0.008, the second 0.012. The higher the ratio, the stronger the signaling of cardiac risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the study, the 6,947 participants were divided into three groups based on their ratios; those with the highest showed a stronger association with disease than other participants did. The D.H.R.P.S. metric was also better at revealing disease risk than were step counts or heart rates alone, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We designed this metric to be low-cost and to use data we’re already collecting,” Mr. Chen said. “People who want to be in charge of their own health can do a little bit of math to figure this out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 13:30:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNVlA3QjFsc3ZIRzlMMVFDaFd3SzFZMHhCUlJ6akJxdnlyTHF5Q2ZPeE5lWVE0UkFqdzNtVXhDX2VPNks3bzNFVTFMcmlmRTdCX2tzdzc0TlJEU3pDQjlneVdZMEJubVluNE5SUFF5WFI3MEtLalpBSGliYmEtcFRZN0JB</guid></item><item><title>Artificial sweetener sucralose confuses brain and increases hunger, study says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPMC1EYmtRWU92ZXJyeENSMGpBRFVzZDQ0YkpXOGgtdWtWZVZUOG5HaTd2UGVma0ZMaThnUFNvSEp5ZGFKWkwwTk1DTlhLX0w2U3llMmdRRC1rLU9UbWxFREE5dDJnb2RleUJ2d3RyRWZmZWhfQ1ZIbzlOd2Fld18wV3dENlNJb3gxTEFxeHotWFpBWmRuV3BQZHFQXzVDcllhbW9MTElR0gGcAUFVX3lxTE1Fc1JiV1RNYUtIV3NvMGx0bkxHSjZET3dmTmtMXzJwM1FaUVE1SlFtdkJIZmUwd05tLVlzUHZoTjEzeTUxN3VhMDdLSmkyLXdFellxTzdzdC1SeG5xQUlTU2pXcl9pTEE0VGxwaV94N3lEM0d4WkJaMEtBTXNvS09VUEpsNzJONkVZRTRSM2lOc1NIMDlRVmV0RFk4bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A growing body of evidence has increasingly linked diet sodas and other no- or low-calorie foods with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/health/video/zero-calorie-sweetener-weight-gain-sanjay-gupta-digvid"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt; — so much so that the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/15/health/who-sweeteners-weigh-loss-guideline-wellness/index.html"&gt;issued an advisory&lt;/a&gt; in May 2023 saying not to use sugar substitutes for weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000d3b6m7q0gyjt9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Replacing free sugars with non-sugar sweeteners does not help people control their weight long-term,” Dr. Francesco Branca, director of WHO’s department of nutrition and food safety, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/23/health/artificial-sweetener-reduction-wellness"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000f3b6md97rbbyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, a new study may shed light on why consuming too much of the artificial sweetener sucralose could be counterproductive. Instead of the brain sending a signal to eat less, sucralose triggers an increase in appetite when consumed in a drink.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000g3b6mpjv9j5k5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sucralose activates the area in the brain that regulates hunger, and that activation, in turn, is linked to greater ratings of hunger,” said lead study author Dr. Katie Page, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics and director of the Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000h3b6mzk2mdcbj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, people who drank water with sucralose said their appetite increased by nearly 20% compared with drinking water with table sugar, Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000i3b6mv5lex0th@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, sucralose is a key ingredient in some Splenda sugar substitutes.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/sucralose/" target="_blank"&gt;sucralose is known as E955&lt;/a&gt; and is found in sugar substitutes sold under the brand names Candys, Canderel Yellow, Cukren, Nevella, Splenda, SucraPlus, Sukrana and Zerocal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000j3b6m7xd0tliz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study only investigated the impact of sucralose and did not research other popular artificials sweeteners such as &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/aspartame/" target="_blank"&gt;aspartame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/acesulfame-k/" target="_blank"&gt;acesulfame-K&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kraftchemical.com/product/sodium-saccharin/" target="_blank"&gt;sodium saccharin&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This is a very high quality study, using state of the art methods and careful analysis,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine, via email. Katz, founder of the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.truehealthinitiative.org/" target="_blank"&gt;True Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine, was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000l3b6msgx0rmv5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors interpreted their results carefully yet make a strong case that “non-caloric sweeteners, and sucralose specifically, interfere with normal appetite regulation in ways that could have adverse effects on weight control and health,” Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000m3b6mnamo4nj6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for Heartland Food Products Group, which manufactures Splenda, said that low-calorie and zero-calorie sweeteners are backed by research and expert recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8taooq900043b6m6173swe4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Low- or zero-calorie sweeteners like sucralose are recommended by healthcare professionals, food safety experts and credible health organizations for diabetes and weight management based on trusted scientific research showing that the impact of low- or zero-calorie sweeteners on body weight is similar to that of water, and that sweet-tasting products have decreased the want for additional sweets while also helping people manage weight, reduce intake of calories from added sugars, and manage blood sugar levels,” the spokesperson wrote via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000o3b6mt2yjecmu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea that artificial sweeteners may be increasing hunger signals from the mammalian brain isn’t new — a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784545?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=092821" target="_blank"&gt;prior study&lt;/a&gt; coauthored by Page  found women and people with obesity were especially sensitive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000p3b6mw322oruy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Animal studies have hinted at some of these effects,” Katz said. However, “this is, to my knowledge, the most decisive study to date in humans of direct effects on the appetite center.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000q3b6mvo3wc56e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All cells in the body require glucose for energy. The brain is the biggest user, gobbling up to &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/publications-archive/brain/sugar-brain" target="_blank"&gt;half of all sugars&lt;/a&gt; circulating in the blood. Nature, however,  designed the brain to respond to natural sugars such as glucose found in whole fruits and some vegetables.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000r3b6mwpjda4uj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Artificial sweeteners, therefore, appear to confuse the brain, Page said, by sending signals of sweetness without delivering the needed calories the brain requires. Scientists have hypothesized that when those promised calories don’t arrive, the brain may send out a signal to eat more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000s3b6mnad22171@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01227-8" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Metabolism, asked 75 people to consume one of three drinks on three separate occasions: plain water, water sweetened with table sugar (sucrose), and water sweetened with sucralose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000t3b6m1yl5quh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During each visit, the research team tested participants’ fasting blood sugar levels, followed by a brain scan called Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or fMRI, which tracks blood flow to capture activity in different regions of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000u3b6mg7bi0qx1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They came out of the scanner and consumed one of the three drinks, and went back into the scanner,” Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000v3b6mh1tlp2ke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One glass contained 300 milliliters of water and 75 grams (about 2.5 ounces) of sugar (sucrose), which is the equivalent of a 16-ounce can of sugary soda, Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000w3b6mndvnxqp2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another drink contained enough sucralose to match that sweetness. Sucralose is about &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/aspartame-and-other-sweeteners-food#:~:text=Sucralose%20is%20sold%20under%20the,under%20certain%20conditions%20of%20use." target="_blank"&gt;600 times sweeter than sugar&lt;/a&gt;, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. The third drink was plain water, which served as a control.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000x3b6m3h8dwyes@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the brain scanning, Page and her team did another round of blood sampling at 10 minutes, 35 minutes and 120 minutes after consuming the drink and asked participants to rate their hunger level.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000y3b6m3stwgnre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “(The study) is particularly strong because it used repeated measures within the same participants and included different methods such as brain imaging, blood draws, and subjective ratings to test their hypothesis,” said Kyle Burger, a scientist at the nonprofit Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, which investigates human senses of taste and smell. Burger was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir000z3b6muet2vijq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to finding that drinks with sucralose increased the sensation of hunger by about 17%, Page and her team found increased connections to other parts of the brain responsible for controlling motivation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00103b6m6own09nl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sucralose appears to affect your decision-making skills,” Page said. “For example, we found increased brain connectivity between the hypothalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex, which controls the risks and rewards of a decision.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00113b6mvhtamvd9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, blood tests showed sucralose had no effect on hormones the brain uses to tell when we are satisfied and no longer hungry, Page said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00123b6m293hhjj6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s no signal, no signal at all,” she said. “There’s a sweetness signal, but there’s no hormone signal telling you you’re full. Sucralose doesn’t have an effect on those hormones.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00133b6moqaw01g5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not everyone, however, may feel the combined effects of sucralose in the same way, Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00143b6meg4td4fb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those with insulin resistance, for instance, may be especially prone to disruption of normal appetite control with sucralose,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00153b6m3g8hwie2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recommendations on how to manage the body’s reactions to artificial sweeteners are currently complex, Page said. For example, the American Diabetes Association tells people with insulin resistance and diabetes to &lt;a href="https://professional.diabetes.org/sites/dpro/files/2023-12/sugar_substitutes.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;use no-calorie drinks and foods&lt;/a&gt;, but sparingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00163b6mbkjgorub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m an endocrinologist so I see patients for diabetes and obesity,” Page said. “I would never say drink or eat more sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00173b6m0u3z10bh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Instead, I tell my patients to not rely on non-caloric sweeteners as a substitute for sugar and try to reduce the overall intake of dietary sweeteners in general,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00183b6mmh4l1kbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Katz agreed, preferring to suggest a form of &lt;a href="https://hartfordhealthcare.org/file%20library/services/pdfs/hvi-lifestyle-taste-bud-rehab-3-pager-hartford-healthcare.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;taste bud “rehab&lt;/a&gt;” that can reduce overall use of sugars, no matter what their form.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir00193b6m4lorqw8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A truly wholesome diet has little added sugar in the first place, and thus no sugar to ‘replace’ with sucralose and related compounds,” Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001a3b6msfhv72ya@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just as many people have cut their use of salt, it’s possible to cut your use of sweeteners by teaching taste buds to desire fewer sweets, he said. Taste buds will respond by finding sugary foods that used to be delicious now cloyingly sweet, or in the case of sodium, much too salty, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4500487/#:~:text=In%20summer%202014%2C%2020%20people,use%20less%20or%20even%20no" target="_blank"&gt;research has shown&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001b3b6mjmytvsiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Start out by finding hidden sources of sugar in foods you may not realize are sweetened, Katz told CNN in a prior interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001c3b6m9bqu0w9m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I asked you to boycott all the desserts in your life, you would probably rebel or fail,” Katz said. “But there is a massive amount of added sugar and sweeteners hiding in foods that are not sweet — in salad dressing, pasta sauce, bread, crackers, even salty chips.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8t1f2ir001d3b6mi2hdkx8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By choosing products without sweeteners, he said, it’s possible to reduce a person’s daily intake of sugar or sweeteners “by a third, maybe even a half as many grams a day before we even lay a hand on anything that you actually expect to be sweet.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alopecia is an autoimmune disorder that causes non-scarring hair loss on the scalp and body that is experienced by almost &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5573125/" target="_blank"&gt;2% of the global population&lt;/a&gt; at some point in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers from Australia, Singapore, and China discovered that activated hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), crucial for hair regrowth and repair, require a powerful protector protein called MCL-1 to function successfully. Without MCL-1, these cells undergo stress and eventually die, leading to hair loss, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5" target="_blank"&gt;as reported in&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt; study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hair follicles are small tunnel-like structures in the skin where hair grows. These follicles repeatedly cycle through three &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/distinct+phases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;distinct phases&lt;/a&gt;: anagen, the active growth phase; catagen, a transitional phase marked by slowed growth and follicle shrinkage; and telogen, a resting phase where growth ceases and shedding occurs, after which the cycle begins afresh, driven by HFSCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows that when HFSCs experience stress from hair shaft loss or follicle shrinkage, they can undergo apoptosis—a controlled way for cells to die— which furthers hair loss. This apoptotic process is controlled by a group of proteins called the BCL-2 family, which decides whether a cell should survive or die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is known that MCL-1, which is part of the BCL-2 family, belongs to the pro-survival protein group, its role in HFSC regulation and hair regeneration is a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate MCL-1's influence on HFSC regulation, the researchers of this study deleted the MCL-1 gene from mice skin cells and removed certain patches of existing hair. They found that lack of MCL-1 from birth did not impact the formation of hair follicles but led to gradual hair loss from declining HFSCs over time.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In adult mice, MCL-1 deletion quickly destroyed active HFSCs, which completely stopped hair regeneration in the patches where hair was removed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inactive HFSCs remained intact even after MCL-1 deletion, but once they woke up and started dividing to grow new hair, they experienced stress, which triggered the P53 protein essential for regulating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+death/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell death&lt;/a&gt;. However, deletion of a P53 gene restored hair growth even in the absence of MCL-1, suggesting collaboration between MCL-1 and P53 in maintaining a balance between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+survival/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell survival&lt;/a&gt; and death in hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice model experiments also revealed that the ERBB signaling pathway (controls cellular processes) plays a key role in keeping active hair follicle stem cells alive by increasing the production of MCL-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deeper knowledge of molecular pathways and interactions that regulate hair &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/follicle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;follicle&lt;/a&gt; growth and cell death paves the way for innovative strategies for treating alopecia and preventing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hair+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hair loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

When they analyzed data from 777 participants age 70 and older in the &lt;a href="https://do-health.eu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DO-HEALTH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DO-HEALTH&lt;/a&gt; trial, they found that &lt;strong&gt;taking 1 gram of omega-3 fatty acids every day was linked to slower biological aging.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, many different factors affect how fast you age, but taking a supplement could be one easy way to help keep your cells younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are involved in the structure of our cell membranes, provide energy for our body and help form signaling molecules for our cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune and endocrine systems, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.

The researchers who conducted this study used four epigenetic clocks to get a range of measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The good news is that we know today that only a small part (10 to 30%) of the variability of health span is explained by our genes,” says Bischoff-Ferrari. “The rest is determined by our environment, socioeconomic factors and especially lifestyle, such as exercise and diet.” &lt;strong&gt;Bischoff-Ferrari and her colleagues used epigenetic clocks to measure the biological ages of people who took 1 gram of an algae-based omega-3 supplement daily, 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily and/or participated in a strength-training exercise program for 30 minutes three times per week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who took the omega-3 supplement every day for three years had a biological age that was an average of 3 months younger than their chronological age, according to three of the four epigenetic clocks. The fourth clock showed “there was an additional benefit if omega-3 was combined with vitamin D and exercise,”&lt;/strong&gt; says Bischoff-Ferrari. Three months may not sound like much, but Bischoff-Ferrari says it’s enough to have an impact at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows exactly why omega-3 fatty acids could have such a strong effect on the aging process, but there are plenty of hypotheses. “Notably, these results complement previous clinical findings in the same trial (DO-HEALTH), which found that omega-3 lowered the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522002544#bib19" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rate of falls by 10%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rate of falls by 10%&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772758" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduced the rate of infections by up to 13%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduced the rate of infections by up to 13%&lt;/a&gt;, while omega-3, vitamin D and exercise combined &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2260134124000975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lowered the risk of pre-frailty by 39%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lowered the risk of pre-frailty by 39%&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2022.852643/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:invasive cancer by 61%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;invasive cancer by 61%&lt;/a&gt;,” says Bischoff-Ferrari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems as though omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D and exercise could provide a triple-whammy of aging protection. “It is well-documented in basic science that vitamin D prevents uncontrolled cell growth and has anti-inflammatory benefits,” says Bischoff-Ferrari. Meanwhile, exercise is famous for being “a major driver of healthy longevity with protective effects on most age-related chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis and diabetes,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study shows how powerful small lifestyle changes (such as taking a supplement or starting a new exercise regimen) can be when it comes to protecting our health and slowing down the aging process of our cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;fcafotodigital - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As important as they are for our health and longevity, omega-3 fatty acids aren’t easily created in our bodies, so we need to source them from food and supplements. &lt;strong&gt;Foods rich in omega-3s include fatty fish (such as salmon), nuts (like walnuts), seeds (chia seeds, for instance), plant oils (like soybean oil and fortified foods (such as some eggs, yogurt and drinks). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three main types of omega-3 fatty acids — ALA, DHA and EPA. There are no &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-Consumer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:set recommendations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;set recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for the amount of DHA and EPA you should consume, but males age 14 and older should aim for 1.6 grams of ALA every day, while the goal is 1.1 daily grams of ALA for females age 14 and older. People breastfeeding should get 1.3 grams of ALA every day and those who are pregnant should aim for 1.4 grams of ALA. &lt;strong&gt;If you’re not getting enough from your diet, you may want to ask your doctor about taking an omega-3 supplement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ultimate Omega&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HDV7YS?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64303162%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$23.98 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$23.98 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Super Omega-3 Plus EPA/DHA Fish Oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JPD5ZJ4?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64303162%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$33.44 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$33.44 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ultra Omega 3 from Fish Oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/hearstcorp_9eb67_ghk?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F3006986%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252F196155762%253Fselected%253Dtrue%26subId1%3Dghk%7C&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiet-nutrition%2Fa64303162%2Fstudy-omega3-fatty-acids-biolgical-age%2F&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo-us&amp;amp;utm_campaign=65&amp;amp;utm_medium=syn" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$16.88 at walmart.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$16.88 at walmart.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 12:38:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9IcUVtMWhEMk9JM2tkY3BLdTAtQVZfRTJKVHFrdE5DSzVoZ2pURzVqQzRLanAzTVE2WlNQWk13YUpyMUpQRHJ1cTRDVDFqQXJNSjd4NGZjZmNGRm9KTkFqdjZmR1ZrajdaZ3l6TUxsVFhfTzhrV2g0dGdVbXR3R0E</guid></item><item><title>Cold plunges improve your health by literally changing your cells - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQMTMzWWNvY0Y1Z1duZ1Y1S3NuZkZjNWtlWXZaQ1RsTDJ3TjlYVGx4N1hXVUlVVk5ERGdPMzQ0OEtDZzI0SXFvY1BYb2ZIYk1maEJ5d1FYZzRQMzdGV2Q2N1RYamVmNzg0aFBnTHpsZ3R1RzJzNkh4SDJndC02cW95LW9Uc3pLbzhfQ0UtVzVINA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, cold plunges have become a fixture on wellness feeds and gym schedules. People swear by them – claiming everything from mental clarity to faster recovery. But what does science say when you strip away the hype?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; has taken a closer look. Their work didn’t just explore how our bodies handle cold on the outside. It examined what happens on a much deeper level: inside your cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study could shape how we think about cold exposure and its place in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;everyday health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cold-plunges-change-cells-in-one-week"&gt;Cold plunges change cells in one week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;​The &lt;a href="https://hepru.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Human and Environmental Physiology Research Unit&lt;/a&gt; conducted a tightly controlled experiment with ten healthy young men.​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over seven days, each participant immersed himself in 14°C (57.2°F) water for one hour per day. Blood samples were drawn before and after the cold-water sessions on days 1, 4, and 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim wasn’t to measure surface-level outcomes like muscle soreness. Instead, the team analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells to examine cellular stress, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-a-protein-that-reverses-cellular-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recovery&lt;/a&gt;, and resilience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on autophagy (the body’s way of cleaning out damaged components) and apoptosis (programmed cell death).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate that repeated cold exposure significantly improves autophagic function, a critical cellular protective mechanism,” said Professor Kenny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This enhancement allows cells to better manage stress and could have important implications for health and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/defying-time-three-ways-to-slow-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-cold-plunges-caused-stress"&gt;Early cold plunges caused stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the first day, the researchers found clear signs of stress. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/random-dna-mutations-shape-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cells&lt;/a&gt; showed an increase in proteins like p62, which typically accumulate when autophagy is disrupted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LC3-II, a marker of autophagic activity, did not increase. Apoptotic signaling also rose, with a marked spike in cleaved caspase-3, a protein that signals a cell is on its way to self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant that initially, the cold exposure was overwhelming the cells. The natural repair systems weren’t strong enough to counteract the damage. But that would begin to change by day four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signals-of-cellular-recovery"&gt;Signals of cellular recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the fourth day of immersion, early signs of adaptation emerged. LC3-II levels began to climb slightly, and p62 dropped – although still above baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, caspase-3 remained high, indicating the cells were still battling stress. The balance had not yet tipped in favor of full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By the end of the acclimation, we noted a marked improvement in the participants’ cellular cold tolerance. This suggests that cold acclimation may help the body effectively cope with extreme environmental conditions,” explained King, the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day seven marked a significant change. LC3-II rose substantially, showing robust autophagic activity. p62 dropped below baseline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caspase-3 levels returned to near normal. The cells had started to regulate themselves more efficiently, showing they had adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cellular-learning-confirmed"&gt;Cellular learning confirmed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To take it further, the researchers tested the participants’ blood cells in cold conditions outside the body – before and after the week-long immersion routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as ex vivo testing, this allowed the team to simulate hypothermic states (temperatures as low as 4°C) without endangering the volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before acclimation, these tests revealed poor autophagic responses and increased &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-we-reverse-aging-a-bold-new-approach-could-reprogram-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;apoptosis&lt;/a&gt; across all cold conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after the seven-day program, LC3-II increased significantly at every temperature below 35°C. Apoptotic signals, particularly cleaved caspase-3, decreased, while p62 remained lower across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts showed that cells had become better at handling cold stress, even when removed from the body. It wasn’t just temporary resistance – it was programmed cellular behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cold-plunges-triggered-stress-proteins"&gt;Cold plunges triggered stress proteins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tracking autophagy and apoptosis, the researchers also looked at heat shock proteins – namely HSP70 and HSP90. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proteins help stabilize other proteins during stress. Both increased during cold immersion but did not change significantly across the seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the cold exposure was enough to activate them, but the level of stimulus did not escalate throughout the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s possible the body tuned its internal systems to respond more efficiently without ramping up these proteins further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work underscores the importance of acclimation protocols in enhancing human health, especially in contexts where individuals are exposed to extreme temperatures,” noted Professor Kenny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cooling-curve-and-shivering-clues"&gt;Cooling curve and shivering clues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides cellular markers, physiological changes supported the idea of adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By day seven, participants had smaller increases in blood lactate levels – indicating less shivering. The body was becoming more efficient at conserving heat without relying on rapid muscle contractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooling rates slowed too. Participants took longer to reach the cutoff esophageal temperature of 35.5°C. While core temperature didn’t differ much across days, these smaller indicators confirmed the shift in cold tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-life-and-death-inside-a-cell"&gt;Life and death inside a cell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, at colder temperatures (33°C and below), both autophagic and apoptotic signals rose post-acclimation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual response could mean cells were trying to survive using every tool available. When stress surpassed a certain threshold, even enhanced autophagy wasn’t enough to prevent some cells from progressing toward death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mirrors findings in animal models, where excessive autophagy can trigger cell death if damage is too severe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway? Cold adaptation boosts protection, but it’s not a magic shield against extreme stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cold-plunges-may-slow-cellular-aging"&gt;Cold plunges may slow cellular aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were amazed to see how quickly the body adapted,” said King. “Cold exposure might help prevent diseases and potentially even slow down aging at a cellular level. It’s like a tune-up for your body’s microscopic machinery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this research focused on healthy young males, it opens a door for broader inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could older adults benefit from structured cold exposure? What about people with chronic illnesses that impair autophagic function? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are next steps scientists are eager to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cold-exposure-as-health-practice"&gt;Cold exposure as health practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study presents a strong case for integrating safe, structured cold exposure into wellness routines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven days of one-hour immersion changed how cells handled stress, repaired themselves, and avoided damage. It’s one of the first studies to show these changes at a molecular level in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research will help define guidelines: how cold, how long, and how often. But one thing is clear – the body learns. And when exposed with care, cold might not be something to avoid, but something to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re an athlete or just someone curious about longevity, this research suggests that the answer might be hiding in plain sight – or maybe, in a tub of ice water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adbi.202400111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Advanced Biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 12:09:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQMTMzWWNvY0Y1Z1duZ1Y1S3NuZkZjNWtlWXZaQ1RsTDJ3TjlYVGx4N1hXVUlVVk5ERGdPMzQ0OEtDZzI0SXFvY1BYb2ZIYk1maEJ5d1FYZzRQMzdGV2Q2N1RYamVmNzg0aFBnTHpsZ3R1RzJzNkh4SDJndC02cW95LW9Uc3pLbzhfQ0UtVzVINA</guid></item><item><title>A 30-Year Study May Have Found The Single Best Diet For Healthy Aging - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOLWgxQm50Y1JfanZxQmFaQm9HbkZxaUFMbmo1S2drekxERE9STFBURGZwbU9YU1hOZkVFd09uSEc0dm1FOW9URUNCd1FzWVNpV0NpM3NPaGRpU0pnbzJiUGdIdnR3ZVVyNW5sY3VwWXNIcGJlNFdTNWhZMDg4T1VmRm1YZjRCS29hREN5eEFicm8yTnY1WS1lUko0NnM2akk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Would you add a few more vegetables and whole grains to your diet in return &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/protecting-your-muscle-mass-is-vital-for-healthy-aging-heres-why"&gt;for a healthy old age&lt;/a&gt;? A new study has broken down in detail the food groups that increase the likelihood of healthy aging – and identified the best diet overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the study, researchers led by a team from Harvard University defined healthy aging as reaching 70 without any chronic diseases – and still being &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night"&gt;in good shape mentally&lt;/a&gt; and physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) came top of eight &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-should-eat-more-of-these-8-healthy-foods-and-heres-why"&gt;healthy dietary patterns&lt;/a&gt; studied: &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/scoring-highly-on-alternative-healthy-eating-index-lowers-risk-for-many-illnesses-202202082681"&gt;developed by Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, the AHEI prioritizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diet also keeps red and processed meats, sugary drinks, and salt down to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156605" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart.jpg" alt="Diet chart" class="wp-image-156605 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart-509x415.jpg 509w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DietChart-600x489.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156605" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;All the dietary guidelines studied improved the likelihood of healthy aging. (Tessier et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings also show that there is no one-size-fits-all diet," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Anne-Julie Tessier, a professor of nutrition from the University of Montreal in Canada. "Healthy diets can be adapted to fit individual needs and preferences."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tracked the eating habits of 105,015 people across the course of 30 years, cross-referencing how their diets matched up with the eight sets of healthy eating guidelines – and then checking health at 70 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, sticking closely to any of the diet plans improved the chances of aging healthily, and there was a lot of crossover in terms of the healthy eating recommendations: fruits, vegetables, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_grain"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt;, and unsaturated fats were frequently mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 9,771 people met the health criteria at 70, with the AHEI showing the most benefits. The participants who ranked in the top fifth in terms of AHEI adherence were 86 percent more likely to be healthy at 70 than those in the lowest fifth. It seems &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;the widely praised Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; may have some competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Studies have previously investigated dietary patterns in the context of specific diseases or how long people live," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology from Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ours takes a multifaceted view, asking, how does diet impact people's ability to live independently and enjoy a good quality of life as they age?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associations between diet and good health have been demonstrated in countless studies – whether you want to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-can-add-10-years-to-your-life-simply-by-changing-your-diet-massive-study-finds"&gt;add years to your life&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-japanese-diet-is-linked-to-less-brain-shinkage-in-women-experts-say"&gt;keep your brain ticking over&lt;/a&gt; – and while this new research doesn't show direct cause and effect, the link is strong enough to give us useful extra evidence for the benefits of eating well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since staying active and independent is a priority for both individuals and public health, research on healthy aging is essential," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Marta Guasch-Ferré, a professor of epidemiology from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal-based foods, may promote overall healthy aging and help shape future dietary guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Yvonne Vávra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayor of New York City refuses to walk in a straight line, loves hanging out in front of Zabar’s hoping to snag a bagel, and enjoys bossing around dogs — but only the large white ones, because he thinks they’re sheep. There. The truth is out. He also loves jumping into freshly made beds and messing them up. But that’s all just because he’s a dog. Simon of Riverside Drive is the official Dog Mayor of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Simon this week and was shocked to learn not only that we had a Dog Mayor, but that he’s a fellow Upper West Sider! The seven-year-old basset hound-cattle dog mix was sworn in just two months ago on the steps of City Hall, becoming only the second Dog Mayor in the city’s history. He succeeded basset hound Sally Long Dog of the East Village, who had served for two years. In front of some of the city’s most prominent human elected officials, Simon pledged to “uphold the office of New York City Dog Mayor with liberty — and yes, dognity — for all,” before shaking paws with Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who administered the Oaf of Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_92536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92536" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-92536 size-full" src="https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230.jpeg 640w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230-300x149.jpeg 300w, https://www.westsiderag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/79DE0DEF-E6A3-4545-99CF-ECEDA67E5F14-e1743105642230-360x180.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-92536" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Photograph courtesy of Sophie.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Honorary New York City Dog Mayor Election was founded by media producer and dog lover Stephen Calabria as a way to bring joy and foster community during challenging times. With many people feeling overwhelmed, disillusioned, and tangled in the chaos of national politics, electing a Dog Mayor seems like an initiative pawsitively everyone can get behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much more than a happy escape. A Dog Mayor may not know how to come up with plans or proposals to serve the greater good, nor how to mobilize people to step up. Not that many human politicians know, either. But dogs do, in fact, have qualities every good leader needs: They have the power to bring people together and foster a sense of belonging, which many of us crave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking the streets these days, I sometimes feel panic rising because everything seems so normal. People go about their business, sitting on benches, laughing, and eating ice cream. “We have no time for ice cream!” my brain screams. Please excuse it; it’s been screaming a lot, and it’s my fault. I’ve exposed it to too much news. Now it’s running wild, eyes wide and flailing: “The nerve of people to sit on benches in these times!” We should rather … uh … do something. But what? I don’t know. Anyone? The way I experience things is exactly what bad times need to stay bad: people feeling disconnected, scared, hopeless, and jaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s absolutely crucial to eat ice cream. We need to enjoy life and each other’s company, gather, and find out if the people sitting on benches feel the same way. That’s how we gain the strength to create positive change. The power of connection can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who can teach us how to foster these connections? Mayor Simon — representing all the canines of Gotham. Dogs show us that community-building doesn’t have to be complicated: Wag your way into shared moments of joy, be present, loyal, supportive, and always ready to lend a paw to anyone in need. Woof to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs don’t even need to do anything — their presence alone makes us stronger. There’s plenty of scientific evidence showing that dogs not only promote positive interactions between people, but also strengthen social trust and encourage helping behavior within communities. And, of course, they’re natural icebreakers. If you’ve ever walked with a dog, you know how many smiles and conversations come your way. Those small moments that acknowledge your presence instantly make you feel like you belong. You’re not just a passerby; you’re one of the crowd, part of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never met more people than I have since adopting Simon,” says Sophie, the Mayor’s mom. “We get stopped all the time, and I actually have close friends who I met because of Simon. I have so many interactions in a day — that’s my favorite part about the Upper West Side. We love it here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon may never pass a law or make a speech. But we should follow his lead. He ran on the slogan “Adopt a Brighter Future” and plans to use his term to champion animal rescue and adoption. Let’s adopt that mindset and rescue one another from facing these chaotic times alone. Short-legged Simon running the highest pawffice in the city reminds us that making a difference doesn’t always require big, bold steps. Sometimes, it’s simply about showing up with an open, loyal heart. The strength of our community lies not in how much we do, but how well we do it together — never forgetting to refuel along the way. Ice cream for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

A moment in a crib, or the taste of a first birthday cake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="300" data-end="534"&gt;Chances are, those memories aren’t real. Decades of research suggest that most people cannot recall personal experiences from the first few years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-start="536" data-end="789"&gt;However, even though we can’t remember being a baby, a new study has found new evidence that babies do take in the world around them and may also begin forming memories far earlier than once thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-did-the-study-work-and-what-did-it-find"&gt;How did the study work and what did it find?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study published this month in Science by researchers at Yale and Columbia universities has revealed that babies as young as 12 months old can form memories via the hippocampus – a part of the brain that stores memories in adults, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To observe this, the researchers used a specially adapted brain scan for infants during a single session. It allowed them to watch how babies’ brains responded while they were awake and looking at images of faces and objects. Parents remained close to their babies, which helped keep them calm and alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, 26 infants aged four to 25 months were shown a series of images. It was found that if a baby’s hippocampus was more active the first time they saw a particular image, they would look at the same image for longer when it reappeared a short time later, next to a new one – suggesting they recognised it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that babies’ brains have the capacity for forming memories – but how long-lasting these memories are is still an open question,” said Tristan Yates, a postdoctoral research scientist in the department of psychology at Columbia University and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time scientists have directly observed how a memory begins to take shape in an awake baby’s brain. Previous &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34022155/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; relied on indirect observations, such as watching whether babies reacted to something familiar. This time, however, researchers observed brain activity linked to specific memories as they form in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most past brain activity studies have been done while babies were asleep, which limited what researchers could learn about conscious memory-building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-tell-us-about-early-life-memories"&gt;What does this tell us about early life memories?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that episodic memory – the kind of memory that helps us remember specific events and the context in which they took place – begins to develop earlier than scientists previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it was widely believed that this type of memory didn’t begin to form until well after a baby’s first birthday, typically around 18 to 24 months. Although the findings from the Science study were strongest in infants older than 12 months, the results were observed in much younger babies as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="so-at-what-age-do-we-start-making-memories"&gt;So, at what age do we start making memories?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now understood that babies begin forming limited types of memory when they are as young as two or three months. These include implicit memories (such as motor skills) and statistical learning, which helps infants detect patterns in language, faces and routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, episodic memory, which allows us to recall specific events as well as where and when they occurred, takes longer to develop and requires the maturation of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Cristina Maria Alberini, professor of neural science at New York University, the period in infancy when the hippocampus is developing its ability to form and store memories may be “critical”. This window could be important not only for memory but also has “great implications for mental health and memory or cognitive disorders”, she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories formed in early childhood do not typically last very long, it is believed, which might explain why we can’t remember them later in life. In an ongoing study at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany, 20-month-old toddlers &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/are-your-earliest-childhood-memories-still-lurking-your-mind-or-gone-forever"&gt;were able to remember&lt;/a&gt; which toy was in which room for up to six months, while younger children retained the memory for only about one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-can-t-we-remember-anything-from-infancy"&gt;Why can’t we remember anything from infancy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="465"&gt;Humans’ near-universal inability to recall personal experiences from before the age of about three is a phenomenon known as “infantile amnesia”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="465"&gt;For decades, scientists believed this happens simply because babies’ brains were too immature to store episodic memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="465"&gt;But the Science study has shown that babies do indeed form memories. The mystery is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; those memories become inaccessible as we grow older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="467" data-end="780"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw1923"&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;, scientists say, is that babies’ brains undergo rapid neurogenesis – the fast-paced creation of new neurons in the brain. This rapid growth might disrupt or “write over” existing memories. In animal studies, when scientists slowed this process in baby mice, the mice were able to retain memories much longer – similar to adult mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1066" data-end="1357"&gt;There is also a hypothesis that episodic memory requires language to describe them and a “sense of self” to relate to them. Since these skills don’t fully develop until around age three or four, the brain might not yet have the tools to organise and retrieve memories in the way adults do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1359" data-end="1665"&gt;Some researchers also think the process of forgetting might serve a developmental purpose. By letting go of specific early experiences, the brain might be better able to focus on building general knowledge – to understand how the world works, for example – without being distracted by detailed memories which no longer serve a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="can-some-people-remember-events-from-infancy"&gt;Can some people remember events from infancy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people claim they can remember being a baby, but there is no evidence that what they describe are genuine episodic memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Yale and Columbia study, this belief typically stems from a psychological process called “source misattribution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People may remember information, such as that they cried during their first haircut, but not where that information came from. They might unconsciously attribute the memory to personal experience when it actually came from a photo, family stories or a parent’s retelling. Over time, the line between “real” and “reconstructed” has blurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows that early family stories, frequent photo viewings or cultural emphasis on early development can all contribute to this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale is currently conducting a new study in which parents will film their babies regularly, either with their phones angled from the baby’s point of view or by using head-mounted cameras on toddlers. Later, as the children grow older, the researchers will show the children these old videos to see if they recognise the experiences, primarily by monitoring brain activity, to find out how long early memories can last, Yates told Al Jazeera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="could-early-memories-be-recalled-later-in-life"&gt;Could early memories be recalled later in life?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is debate about whether early life memories are completely erased or have simply become inaccessible and could eventually be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yates said that while the latest study does not answer this question, preliminary evidence from other research at the Yale lab shows that early life memories can be recalled in early childhood, but not later childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think the idea that at least some of our early life memories may exist in some form in our brains as adults is fascinating,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of adult rodents have shown that early memories can be brought back through approaches such as optogenetics – activating the specific brain cells which are believed to store those memories. This works by identifying the brain cells involved in forming a memory, then later using light to reactivate those same cells, causing the animal to recall the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techniques such as optogenetics cannot yet be used in humans, but the study of rodents suggests that the process by which we retrieve memories is where the issue lies, rather than whether the memories exist at all, according to Paul Frankland, senior scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps there are natural conditions where these early life memories become more accessible,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychoanalysts such as Sigmund Freud believed that early childhood memories are not lost but buried deep in the unconscious, and that psychotherapy might help bring them to the surface by changing mental states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Frankland said that this is a “controversial area” as “it is difficult to verify the veracity of recovered memories”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera English</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 11:26:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNV1lDVnh1VHJ5UnNUYzZMeldGcnBULXNRQlo3Qkl6bld0YWVGcnlST1VrZE81aFEyc2Q0NEF3ck9rOUxydGFtUGd6dTNNZTdjaEw5Rm11c0tfYmZiZ1ROU1V5d2VfaUFSWDFtdjB4Z3gwQmRzM01IR19qSDZBSkJ1QUlPdmFDQjVraV9fUGU4RHVvTHY5eFhldGJvekJWSzB0R1BLSXBhQjRjMmRO0gGyAUFVX3lxTE45bzZpbTNLNVd0MXlJa2hPU1gyTXR4UVZCTkhZOFlyRmZ0M0ctX3g1Nl9yRUx5UkhmOWlqc0ZucTJwbXpzRzdoUDhxSDZNTHE0TTE1UlNVb3hON0pQek50Qk9jQXdZc0RqaUtCa2VkbW9lcW11U1QxNE44aVRvZXJsOEpyY0MyQ1A4VUZIVlMwNFc4U3ZHZnI0SkF0OFc1LWluOFQ5dndzalphZFBnTFpTQkE</guid></item><item><title>'Rucking' Is The Latest Walking Trend You Need To Try.

All you have to do is put on a weighted backpack or rucksack and start moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a low-impact exercise that is pretty much based on military training — think about how the military trains a lot for endurance, they do a fair amount of running, but they also have to carry a lot of heavy equipment, so that’s kind of how rucking started,” said &lt;a href="https://www.hss.edu/rehab-staff_Welch-Matthew.asp" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mathew Welch" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.hss.edu/rehab-staff_Welch-Matthew.asp" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Mathew Welch&lt;/a&gt;, an exercise physiologist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, this exercise offers some extra health rewards on top of a regular walking regimen. Here’s what experts say you should know about rucking and how to try it out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rucking adds resistance training to your walk, and has a host of other fitness benefits, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking brings more of a challenge to your daily walk, which is a good thing for someone who is looking to work their body in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physically, walking is awesome, but sometimes we want to amplify that, and the easy way to do that is adding weight,” Cihlar said. “Resistance training is key, especially as we age, in helping our bone health and our muscle growth because that naturally deteriorates as we get older, starting in our 30s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking takes your walk from a cardio exercise to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cardio plus resistance training. It’s recommended that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/well/move/strength-training-beginners-guide.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="you do 20 minutes of strength training" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/well/move/strength-training-beginners-guide.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;you do 20 minutes of strength training&lt;/a&gt; twice a week, but &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458949/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research shows that" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58514e4b0d06e412d4dc9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458949/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;research shows that&lt;/a&gt; most people do not hit that minimum. Rucking can be one way to achieve that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking is also good for your cardiovascular endurance, Welch said. Specifically, rucking benefits your “cardiac output, it’s going to help with the efficiency of your heart pumping the blood out,” Welch explained. This can help lower your blood pressure and improve your heart rate, so it’s a win-win all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also good for your posture and back strength. “The ruck is kind of pulling you back, so it really forces you to maintain your posture,” Welch said, who added that it’s a good way to offset the hours and hours and hours of sitting you likely do every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Going for a walk with a weighted backpack or rucksack on your back is a good way to add resistance training to your walk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plus, rucking is good for your mental health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rucking is an exercise you do outdoors, and getting outside in itself is great for your mental health.

It gives you time to clear your head,” Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are simple ways you can start rucking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting rucking doesn’t have to be complicated. “What’s nice is you can literally start with a backpack you have in your closet and ... throw some magazines in it ... your water bottle,” Cihlar explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also get a rucksack and rucksack weights if you want to use something that is officially made for the sport. Both experts said a rucksack is preferable because it’s safer. A regular backpack can sit pretty low on your back, which can cause issues if you’re carrying around a heavy bag. If you do decide to opt for a backpack, just make sure it isn’t sagging too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to how much weight you’ll want to carry on your back, that depends on your strength level and your size. “I always say start low because you can always grow from there,” Cihlar said. “You don’t want to start heavy and get discouraged.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t a frequent exerciser or weightlifter, starting with just 5 or 10 pounds and building on that is a good idea, she said. As for distance, start with a mile and see how you feel, Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, if you’re someone that is regularly active and you lift weights, you could probably do a 20-pound plate, a 30-pound plate in your ruck,” Cihlar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting with a mile is a good idea here, too, said Welch, but you can bump it up to a mile and a half or more if you don’t feel challenged. For an additional challenge, take your workout to hilly terrain, Welch added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While medications may be necessary to manage high cholesterol, diet quality is equally important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats, avocados, nuts and leafy greens may help improve cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To support overall heart health, focus on cooking more at home, eating whole foods and staying physically active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Approximately 25 million adults in the United States have high cholesterol, which is defined as a total cholesterol level of 240 mg/dL or higher.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is concerning, as having high cholesterol increases your risk of heart disease and metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Luckily, making a few simple tweaks to your overall lifestyle can go a long way in lowering your cholesterol levels, reducing your risk of disease and helping you live a longer life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the best places to start is by paying closer attention to what you’re putting in your shopping cart. While medication is often recommended and necessary to manage cholesterol levels, good nutrition is also essential.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because certain foods have more cholesterol-lowering benefits than others, we asked dietitians to share the top four foods they recommend adding to your grocery list this week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Oats  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Easy to find in most grocery stores—you can even get them &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-whole-grain-to-buy-at-costco-according-to-a-food-writer-8780277" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;in bulk at Costco&lt;/a&gt;—oats are a must-have pantry staple that won’t break the bank. They’re also one of the best foods for lowering cholesterol levels, thanks to their high &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; content. Soluble fiber binds to cholesterol in the small intestine and prevents it from being absorbed into the bloodstream. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nourishandrenewnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Korrinna Kelly, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Nourish &amp;amp; Renew Nutrition, points out that oats are a good source of beta-glucan, “[a type of] soluble fiber that’s been extensively studied for its cholesterol-lowering properties.” One older study found that consuming 3 grams of beta-glucan from oats per day significantly lowered cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This benefit has since been supported by more recent reviews, including one that specifically looked at the benefits of beta-glucan intake in people with high cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to shopping for oats, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7989862/steel-cut-rolled-or-instant-oats-which-is-the-healthiest/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;no one type&lt;/a&gt; is better than another. Whether you prefer the chewy consistency of steel-cut or the convenience of instant, the key is selecting oats that are free from added sugar. In addition to bumping the calorie content, diets high in added sugar can negatively affect cholesterol levels by increasing LDL or “bad” cholesterol levels and decreasing HDL or “good” cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-avocados"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Avocados &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These creamy green fruits are packed full of healthy fats, fiber and even a little protein. One avocado has about 13.5 grams of fiber—nearly half the daily recommended amount for adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating avocados daily has been shown to improve LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sounds expensive? Not to worry! Even just weekly consumption of avocados has been linked with a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no shortage of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8057914/avocado-recipes-to-make-forever/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ways to include more avocados&lt;/a&gt; in your weekly meals. This nutritious fruit can be added to salads, blended into smoothies, spread over toast or added to your favorite sandwich. You can even cut it in half and top it with some salt for a simple snack. Oh, and if you haven’t tried grilling avocado yet, you really should as you’re missing out on its full creamy potential. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies show that eating nuts regularly could help lower LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and potentially increase HDL cholesterol. What’s more, research suggests that people who incorporate nuts into their regular diet may live longer, healthier lives.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Because each nut offers different types and amounts of nutrients, try to incorporate &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a variety of nuts&lt;/a&gt; throughout the week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are incredibly versatile. They can be enjoyed on their own for a quick snack or added to other dishes, like salads and yogurt, for a delightful crunch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-leafy-greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Leafy Greens &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Multiple studies have linked the regular consumption of leafy greens with benefits for cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Greens like spinach, kale and Swiss chard are packed with vitamins, minerals, soluble fiber, antioxidants and other plant compounds that help fight chronic inflammation and prevent the buildup of cholesterol in the body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides enjoying them in a salad, leafy greens can be sautéed and seasoned for a nutritious side dish, added to baked pasta dishes or blended into your morning smoothie.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-are-optimal-cholesterol-levels"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Are Optimal Cholesterol Levels? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting at age 20, it’s recommended that adults have their cholesterol levels checked at least once every four to six years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More frequent testing may be recommended for folks at a higher risk of heart disease, such as those with a family history of the condition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are the optimal cholesterol levels for adults, according to the CDC:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; around 150 mg/dL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LDL cholesterol:&lt;/strong&gt; 100 mg/dL or less&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDL cholesterol: &lt;/strong&gt;above 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/dL for women&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s worth noting that while the CDC sets optimal total cholesterol at 150 mg/dL, other organizations recommend simply keeping total cholesterol below 200 mg/dL.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-lower-your-cholesterol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Lower Your Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides medications, there are many changes you can make to help improve your cholesterol levels and reduce your risk of heart disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on whole foods. &lt;/strong&gt;This may not come as a surprise, but one of the best ways to support better cholesterol levels is by eating more nutrient-dense whole foods. Fill your plate with whole grains, healthy fats, lean proteins and plenty of colorful fruits and vegetables. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit ultra-processed foods and added sugar. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ultra-processed-foods-cardiovascular-disease-risk-8708994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Highly processed foods&lt;/a&gt; tend to be higher in unhealthy fats, which can worsen cholesterol levels. Similarly, diets high in added sugar may negatively affect heart health. Ideally, limit added sugars to no more than 9 teaspoons per day for men and 6 teaspoons per day for women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook more at home.&lt;/strong&gt; “One of the most powerful lifestyle changes to reduce cholesterol levels is to prepare more of your own meals at home,” says &lt;a href="https://coachsimranmd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Simran Malhotra, M.D., DipABLM, CHWC&lt;/a&gt;, a doctor who practices lifestyle medicine and is the founder of Wellness By LifestyleMD. New to cooking? Start with this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836633/high-cholesterol-diet-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;7-Day Cholesterol-Lowering Meal Plan for Beginners&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move more. &lt;/strong&gt;Regular physical activity is good for virtually all aspects of health—including your heart. And you don’t have to lift heavy or run multiple miles to get a good workout. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8042248/walking-plan-to-lower-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Walking regularly&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to strengthen your heart muscle without putting too much strain on your joints. To help lower cholesterol levels and improve heart health, aim to get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate plant sterols. &lt;/strong&gt;Plant sterols are naturally occurring compounds found in plant foods, like vegetables, that have been shown to have a cholesterol-lowering effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While you can get them through food, folks with high cholesterol may benefit from a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-better-heart-health-11698497" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to your doctor about whether a plant sterol supplement might be right for you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop smoking and limit alcohol intake.&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking is associated with higher cholesterol levels, so quitting as soon as possible may help get your levels down. Similarly, heavy alcohol consumption—defined as more than four or five drinks per day for women or men, respectively—is consistently linked with negative effects on LDL cholesterol and blood pressure levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While you don’t have to give up alcohol completely, it’s recommended to limit intake to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;column Kennedy wrote&lt;/a&gt; for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html"&gt;promoted them with confidence&lt;/a&gt;. One campaign was called “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm"&gt;Get My Flu Shot&lt;/a&gt;.” The agency’s website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html"&gt;told medical providers&lt;/a&gt; they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’s communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes—nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late February, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html"&gt;forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1&lt;/a&gt; bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general US population, they said, was low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the US is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;NPR reported&lt;/a&gt; this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB"&gt;child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/"&gt;downplayed the seriousness&lt;/a&gt; of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/"&gt;only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the CDC added &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;an entry on Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; to its measles website for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, CNN reported that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html"&gt;several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function&lt;/a&gt;, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/26/texas-measles-public-health-funding-cut/"&gt;will hinder their ability to respond&lt;/a&gt; to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20 percent of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt; with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html"&gt;linger in the air&lt;/a&gt; for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles &lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-confirms-passenger-measles-traveled-new-york-washington-dc/16085440/"&gt;rode one of its trains&lt;/a&gt; from New York City to Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

But when it's impaired enough due to old age, the brain's resident immune cells, called microglia, have to jump into action instead, which can tax and overwhelm the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By targeting the meningeal lymphatics, the researchers are hoping to overcome a major hurdle for other therapies designed to battle age-related cognitive issues and neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Unlike therapies that struggle to get past the blood-brain barrier, this latest approach targets areas outside of the brain to gain access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The physical blood-brain barrier hinders the efficacy of therapies for neurological disorders," said Washington University pathology and immunology professor Jonathan Kipnis in a &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/boosting-brains-waste-removal-system-improves-memory-in-old-mice/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the research. "By targeting a network of vessels outside of the brain that is critical for brain health, we see cognitive improvements in mice, opening a window to develop more powerful therapies to prevent or delay cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an experiment, the team placed two identical black rods in a cage with old mice to let them play with them. On the next day, the same mice received one of these rods, as well as a silver rectangular prism. The idea is that older mice will spend roughly the same amount of time playing with either type of object, while younger mice will be more drawn to the novel trinket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then used a treatment to boost the growth and function of the lymphatic vessels in some of the old mice. As a result, the researchers observed that they were spending more time playing with the shiny new object — suggesting their memory had improved, compared to other old mice that didn't receive the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A functioning lymphatic system is critical for brain health and memory," said first author and Washington University postdoctoral fellow Kyungdeok Kim in the statement. "Therapies that support the health of the body’s waste management system may have health benefits for a naturally aging brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team suggests that the meningeal lymphatics treatment led to a reduction in the production of an immune protein called interleukin 6 (IL-6), which has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159124004562#:~:text=Elevated%20IL%2D6%20levels%20correlate,brain%20health%20and%20dementia%20risk." class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;previously been shown&lt;/a&gt; to affect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While plenty of work remains before we can demonstrate that the same approach could work in humans as well, the researchers are hopeful of discovering new ways to slow down the naturally aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Targeting the more easily accessible lymphatic vessels that are located outside the brain may prove to be an exciting new frontier in the treatment of brain disorders," Kipnis said. "We may not be able to revive neurons, but we may be able to ensure their most optimal functioning through modulation of meningeal lymphatic vessels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on neurodegenerative diseases:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/ozempic-like-drug-slows-alzheimers-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Ozempic-Style Drug Slows the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease, Experiment Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 10:45:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPdXhvNGk5YzIwRlM3ZVJ4dDZ0bmhxR1VLMUtrM1drQ1NRRDk2ckwzLWFZQTVPbEpDMC12WUQ5cUR0X1FhaTBJMW1od29DREdZNVhuYThhc2VsVUN2N3J4YmpXSVowTl9nMS1Zc3dXZVVYTnFSbVVuVm5IYXY2STU0Sw</guid></item><item><title>What to know about measles breakthrough cases and why vaccination is still important - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxPR2N3TEtibldkYm1PLTduYURmVW1VUlVXWFd0QzYweHFjVjB5c3l0RTBIYXRLQkk2MjhIa2dkSDlHZFhKZFBMQkV3S1NycHd6aThvMFJWa3BEOTVPcUlabERiamJYSWVjbEVpVzhhWGpjOXgtSV9FR0xNaHBTRjFERk1LWkoyV3dha0xtSHd5WUMtdk1aVlRVSFlweU5kQdIBowFBVV95cUxOd1pFS1FDWTRZRHFCazFnTVp2djJxTXFnM3lwdjdiZDVQSloxaTZidlRnd2NKVTMzRFJYdFFKNklpa0x1Wk5jZDNCV2RxYWVwbDlTaUZ1Y2xZdnRhS3ZvajdNcF9HdTljdWFCVjhhNE1Xb1VNU2JzMVUtcm92ZGZjd0RiVWpiNEpLSFdXZy1Ic2Z1UGdCNFRxMEFVdnNxang1bWpj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;As measles has spread across the United States, the overwhelming majority of cases have been among unvaccinated people or those with unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Of the 483 cases reported by the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), 97% have been confirmed in those who are unvaccinated or with unknown status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, a few cases have been confirmed among individuals fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In Texas, two of the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;400 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; have been among people fully vaccinated.

More than 23,000 study participants with new-onset type 2 diabetes were matched to over 71,000 other participants without the condition based on their &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323586" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt;, age, and gender, with an average follow-up of 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also searched for incidents of obesity-related cancers, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research has shown that cancer-related mortality is increasing in people with type 2 diabetes and we want to help identify whether type 2 diabetes is causing cancer, or are the increased cancers in people living with type 2 diabetes due to the coexistence of obesity,” Owen Tipping, BSc, an MBPhD researcher at the University of Manchester and co-lead author of this study told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can help with the creation of new potential cancer preventative measures and guide whether people with diabetes should undergo cancer screening,” Tipping explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We decided to look at type 2 diabetes and obesity-related cancers because obesity has strong evidence for a causal association with at least 13 cancer types, but this is not so clear for type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes and obesity are associated with similar cancers, and these conditions also often co-exist, making it difficult to decipher whether type 2 diabetes causes cancer, or whether it’s due to coexiting obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Owen Tipping, BSc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, Tipping and his team found that new-onset type 2 diabetes was correlated to a 48% increased risk of developing an obesity-related cancer in men, and a 24% heightened chance in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The significance of this is that type 2 diabetes may increase risk of cancer independent of obesity, rather than it being solely due to obesity — i.e in the scenario where a person living with diabetes has a healthy BMI value,” Tipping explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, scientists found a link between new-onset type 2 diabetes and an increased risk for three of the researched obesity-related cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colorectal cancer risk increased by 27% for men and 34% for women, liver cancer chances almost quadrupled for men and increased five-fold for women. And pancreatic cancer risk almost doubled for women and increased by 74% for men.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The significance of [these findings] is that whilst obesity is causally associated with these cancers, there is evidence from this study that type 2 diabetes is also associated — might be causal here, but more evidence is needed to confirm this,” Tipping said. “Cancer screening for people living with type 2 diabetes might be beneficial to detect these cancers early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan to replicate this study in cohorts of different ancestry, to verify whether these findings are consistent across different populations,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/general-surgery/ca/santa-monica/anton-bilchik-1609916733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Anton Bilchik&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine and Director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I found the study quite surprising since we know that there is a relationship between non-insulin dependent diabetes, obesity, and several cancers,” Bilchik commented. “And the fact that this study demonstrated a relationship between newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes, obesity, and some cancers and not others was quite surprising to me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study suggests and supports that there are other mechanisms involved in the development of certain cancers, such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326359" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;hyperinsulinemia&lt;/a&gt;, inflammation, the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/307998" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, and that there are several possible causes other than those related to obesity,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that there need to be more prospective studies looking at patients that are obese that have type 2 diabetes versus those that don’t and monitoring them prospectively, measuring &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8001241/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;inflammatory markers&lt;/a&gt;, measuring &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/science/biomarkers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;biomarkers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, looking at the microbiome to better understand the causes of some of these so-called obesity-related cancers,” said Bilchik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jack-f-jacoub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jack Jacoub&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified medical oncologist and medical director of MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA, about this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacoub commented that for him, it was still unclear how strong the link is between type 2 diabetes and the cancers discussed in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The obesity-related cancers and the lifestyle modifications that individuals can make to reduce that is probably the bigger message,” Jacoub explained. “It’s interesting, but I wouldn’t go out and tell every type 2 diabetic they’re at increased risk for X number of cancers and to worry about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I would just tell them to try to focus on improving their &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317216" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;hemoglobin A1C&lt;/a&gt; and getting their sugar under control and their weight under control,” he advised.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been several data sets about trying to treat the insulin pathway or use the insulin pathway as somehow a benefit to patients with cancer,” Jacoub continued. “There’s a case of giving an anti-diabetic drug, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/metformin-oral-tablet" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt;, in the case of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10974219/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; — it’s a very large trial going on — and others to see if there’s any possible way to impact it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it still always comes down to core principles for patients because there’s only so much in your control,” Jacoub added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Type 2 diabetes, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323729" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;insulin-dependent [type 1] diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, is one mediated by weight, diet, lack of activity, etc. And if those are things that you can improve, there’s downstream benefits, not only reducing these cancers, but others as well [and] cardiovascular disease,” he pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 06:12:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNeGVpVi1GRmJkRGF1Z1V0MXNoME8tV1lIeU5OQzB2VTk0QU80dEFPeEtmVXZZMDJ0dVpuV3M3ejRvejg4cHhmbmhGUE92bHZvRllVQlV5T3JpOWQxQU1fUGxXOE9mRTI5QkgyVmFhVjd2NV9lLU5ERW1OQmlhelZwVlMwSVFRSVFYZWxGdWgtVnlkN0hiLVZsMEZvb0tLUjF0ZUJiTHJnZHNHMG15OHhmZnZVTDYwWldobnVCeXJ2U09pQQ</guid></item><item><title>Weight Loss Breakthrough: Stanford Scientists Discover “Natural Ozempic” Without the Side Effects - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxPa3Q3V0x3TW80ZFZobDZGUFRuTkpHNWVvREwwT2VoRGhpQm1vbE5sVm9YSUotTGlNZU1wbWxjM09IbzJHanB4a25OenlQczNtaWVxczhKaHQ3bTVwRW9wbFczY19mejNJaXNxQWx3UHpFT25GWUZPQ2RMa2RHTUdEWERGNTM5WGc4VHpkUXUxYmFWWWxaS18ySERLRGY1WUlpRzVIS09NVmhfbXVtdjJDa0c5dmdjWlJ6OHlhbQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 02:36:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPa3Q3V0x3TW80ZFZobDZGUFRuTkpHNWVvREwwT2VoRGhpQm1vbE5sVm9YSUotTGlNZU1wbWxjM09IbzJHanB4a25OenlQczNtaWVxczhKaHQ3bTVwRW9wbFczY19mejNJaXNxQWx3UHpFT25GWUZPQ2RMa2RHTUdEWERGNTM5WGc4VHpkUXUxYmFWWWxaS18ySERLRGY1WUlpRzVIS09NVmhfbXVtdjJDa0c5dmdjWlJ6OHlhbQ</guid></item><item><title>Eating Yoghurt Could Lower Your Risk of Bowel Cancer, Evidence Shows - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQQ2tDWjJ5UUpzdDlHdDdBMEFJRjREeHZCRjJIOFVpLTUxTDROdGQyX1A5X2VpRXl2Y0tpM3p5MTBVczFaSjZqRU5oamdIeEpuNWNxTnJiLXYwYjBtNUpJdXpXUXNHUENOSUNob1NWSkl3OUdGQWExUXJDaWlxT3JlTmVzYkczSXVORERWV0h1ZEsyMGwwRnEwRHN3YTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Hard on the heels of impressive research findings that a glass of milk is &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-a-daily-glass-of-milk-really-could-reduce-bowel-cancer-risk-an-oncologist-explains-247301"&gt;good for reducing cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; has highlighted the potential benefits of yoghurt consumption in lowering the risk of certain types of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="156617" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; – particularly colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of new colorectal cancer cases among people under 55 has doubled globally in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37222697/"&gt;recent years&lt;/a&gt;, with diagnoses &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30520562/"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; by nearly 20%. As a consultant oncologist, many people have asked me how their risk can be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237"&gt;emerging evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that regular yoghurt consumption may have a protective effect against certain aggressive forms of colorectal cancer by modifying the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/gut-microbiome-1624"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, the natural bacteria that live in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in overall health, influencing digestion, immune function and even cancer risk. The gut bacteria can live &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35427497/"&gt;inside&lt;/a&gt; cancer itself, and in general a healthy balance of these bacteria is thought to be essential for maintaining a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00158-8"&gt;strong immune system&lt;/a&gt; and preventing inflammation, which can contribute to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bug-drugs-bacteria-based-cancer-therapies-are-finally-overcoming-barriers-251278"&gt;cancer development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2VdZwUmVlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;span&gt;oghurt contains live cultures of beneficial bacteria, such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/digestive-health/lactobacillus-bulgaricus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;lactobacillus bulgaricus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Probiotics-HealthProfessional/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;streptococcus thermophilus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which can help maintain this balance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that consuming two or more servings of yoghurt per week was associated with a lower risk of a specific type of aggressive colorectal cancer, which occurs on the right side of the colon and is associated with poorer survival outcomes compared with cancers on the left side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study analysed data from over 150,000 participants followed for several decades, indicating that long-term yoghurt consumption may alter the gut microbiome in ways that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-00974-4"&gt;protect&lt;/a&gt; against certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed the participants every two years about their yoghurt intake, and measured the amount of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10869629/"&gt;a type of bacteria found in yoghurt&lt;/a&gt;) in the tumour tissue of 3,079 people within the sample who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While yoghurt did not directly lower the risk for all types of colorectal cancer, those who ate two or more servings of yoghurt per week had a lower risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237#abstract"&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-positive proximal colon cancer"&lt;/a&gt;, a type of colorectal cancer that occurs in the right side of the colon and has one of the lowest survival rates. This new work also validates and builds on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7727484/"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; showing similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how yoghurt might reduce cancer risk. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26846801/"&gt;key mechanism&lt;/a&gt; is the modulation of the gut &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2464945?src=recsys"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoghurt's probiotics can enhance the diversity and balance of gut bacteria, potentially &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7913863/"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and levels of cancer-causing chemicals (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9915879/"&gt;carcinogens&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, yoghurt may exert anti-inflammatory effects on the colon lining cells, called the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10030639/"&gt;mucosa&lt;/a&gt;, which could help prevent cancer development. Improving gut barrier function is another potential mechanism, as yoghurt may reduce &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28091645/"&gt;gut permeability&lt;/a&gt;, which is linked to increased cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choose wisely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its potential anti-cancer effects, yoghurt offers several other health benefits. Like milk, it is rich in calcium, which supports bone density and may &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3641848/"&gt;reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt; of brittle bones, known as osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular yoghurt consumption has also been associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6613217/"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and reduced risk of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29462263/"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. Some studies suggest that yoghurt intake may help prevent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28615384/"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and other diseases too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when incorporating yoghurt into your diet, it's important to choose wisely. Opt for plain, unflavored yoghurt to avoid added sugars, which can negate health benefits – for example by causing weight gain, which is a risk factor for obesity and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30506248/"&gt;fermentation processes&lt;/a&gt; can result in varying levels of beneficial bacteria, so look for yoghurts with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24695895/"&gt;live cultures&lt;/a&gt;. Plain, unsweetened Greek yoghurt is generally higher in protein and lower in sugar, while full-fat yoghurt often has fewer processed ingredients than reduced-fat or non-fat variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoghurt contains all nine essential amino acids, and aside from improving gut health, a serving of plain Greek yoghurt contains 15 to 20 grams of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609537/"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are nearly 45,000 cases of bowel cancer every year in the UK, making it the nation's fourth most common cancer, and third &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/72/2/338"&gt;worldwide&lt;/a&gt; – but many of these are &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/bowel-cancer"&gt;preventable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R6OR_SpmAGI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cancer Research UK &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/bowel-cancer#heading-Three"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, 54 percent of all bowel cancers could be prevented by having a healthier lifestyle. Smoking, lack of exercise, alcohol, eating processed meat, and poor diet are all &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016508518349424"&gt;significant factors&lt;/a&gt; in the development of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emerging evidence suggests that yoghurt, particularly when consumed regularly, may play a role in reducing the risk of certain aggressive forms of colorectal cancer. While more research is needed to fully understand these effects, incorporating yoghurt into a balanced diet could be a beneficial choice for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as with any dietary recommendation, it's crucial to consider the broader context of a healthy lifestyle, including a diverse diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, along with regular physical activity. While yoghurt is not a magic bullet against cancer, it is a nutritious food that can contribute to a healthy diet and potentially offer protective effects against certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As research continues to uncover the complex relationships between diet, gut health and cancer risk, incorporating yoghurt into your daily routine may be a simple yet beneficial step towards a healthier life.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/251942/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Plastics have improved modern life in countless ways, but the ultimate price of this convenience is only now coming clearly into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have reached the point as a society where researchers have begun looking beyond the environmental hazards of plastic pollution to uncover hidden connections between plastic exposure and human well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions are emerging about how microplastics might be &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-chewing-gum-may-be-full-of-microplastics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;affecting our bodies&lt;/a&gt; and whether this is something we should address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some everyday items, such as water bottles, may contribute far more than trash. They could be releasing tiny plastic particles that slip into our bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early studies suggest that plastic particles are influencing human &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/study-reveals-over-2000-genetic-markers-that-affect-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a condition linked to serious cardiovascular problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Johanna Fischer from the Department of Medicine at &lt;a href="https://www.dp-uni.ac.at/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Danube Private University&lt;/a&gt; in Austria, a few recent findings have sparked new debates about what happens when microplastics flow through our bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tiny-pieces-of-plastic-wreaking-havoc"&gt;Tiny pieces of plastic wreaking havoc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics measure less than 5 mm, arising from the breakdown of larger plastics or from everyday sources like car tires and synthetic clothing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have been detected in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-pose-a-greater-threat-to-some-ocean-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;food, water, and the air&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists have identified them in the placenta, in certain organs, and even in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their presence has raised concerns because they might trigger inflammation or hormonal imbalances. By entering daily routines unnoticed, these microscopic bits could pose health hazards that are still under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent work has pointed to an unexpected culprit for high blood pressure. Their investigations indicate that common water bottles can release particles into the liquid we drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to preliminary insights, microplastics can migrate into our system, with potential effects on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-smell-control-your-blood-pressure-new-research-says-yes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure measurements&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators also discovered these minute fragments in glass containers, which complicates efforts to avoid them altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points to a wider issue that stretches beyond visible waste and calls for innovative approaches to monitoring exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastics-linked-to-blood-pressure"&gt;Plastics linked to blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight healthy adults took part in a project aimed at exploring any links between plastics and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were asked to rely on tap water instead of bottled drinks for about a month. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/black-gold-the-vitamin-packed-fruit-that-regulates-blood-sugar-and-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; readings were collected at the outset, after two weeks, and at the end of four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings indicated that women showed a noticeable dip in blood pressure levels, particularly in diastolic readings, while men did not exhibit the same changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One explanation might be that only three men participated. That small number makes it difficult to form broad conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the overall data hint that cutting back on plastics could influence cardiovascular health by reducing the number of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-widespread-in-the-seafood-we-eat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic particles&lt;/a&gt; present in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research group emphasizes that larger trials are needed. They aim to measure the actual concentration of microplastics in the blood, providing a clearer picture of how plastic exposure might relate to changes in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-pressure-and-plastics-the-results"&gt;Blood pressure and plastics – the results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We concluded, after extensive research, that beverages packaged in plastic bottles should be avoided,” the research team warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes observed in blood pressure suggest that reducing the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-in-the-brain-alarming-new-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intake of plastic particles&lt;/a&gt; could lower cardiovascular risk, emphasizing how these findings may fit into the bigger picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these scientists, a lower exposure to plastics seems to correlate with improvements in some blood pressure markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By stating that “plastic particles &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-found-in-every-semen-sample-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;present in the bloodstream&lt;/a&gt; could contribute to increased blood pressure,” the team highlighted a potential link between microplastics and cardiovascular concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although their study involved only a small group, they view the results as a motivation to investigate these interactions further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the precise pathways remain unclear, the prospect that tiny plastic fragments might affect blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health should encourage us all to rethink these common habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because hypertension is a leading cause of heart complications, any factor that might raise blood pressure deserves scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans already face multiple risks for cardiovascular disease, so identifying one that might be avoidable is compelling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting bottled beverages or opting for tap water in reusable non-plastic containers will definitely help reduce exposure, though additional verification is needed to confirm the long-term impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing many different studies, it’s very clear that microplastics have infiltrated every nook and cranny of our bodies, natural environments, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sounding-the-alarm-microplastics-are-disrupting-photosynthesis-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;global ecosystems at large&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of high blood pressure and other cardiovascular health issues that arise from the consumption of microplastics, scientists and physicians are concerned about inflammation, endocrine problems, and oxidative stress, all of which can harm overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the convenience of disposable products is tempting, making a personal choice of removing single-use plastics from our everyday lives will undoubtedly yield benefits – both for our health and the global environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8929/3/3/26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Microplastics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

      &lt;p&gt;Measles spreads quickly in communities where vaccination rates are low - and vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise for years.  But amid a growing outbreak in Texas, vaccine enthusiasm is growing, as parents try to get their kids vaccinated early.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/b&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AILSA CHANG, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Measles is now spreading in five states - Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio and Oklahoma. Most of the cases are in West Texas, which reported today that they have had 400 cases since the outbreak started. Measles spreads quickly in communities with low vaccination rates, and vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise for years. But now, some pediatricians are seeing vaccine enthusiasm. NPR's Maria Godoy is here to tell us more. Hi, Maria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARIA GODOY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: OK, so what are the latest numbers we're seeing right now on measles?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Well, today, Texas reported 77 new cases just since Tuesday, which just goes to show how contagious measles is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Yeah. Health officials there are expecting more cases, and as you noted, the virus is now spreading in other states. New Mexico has 44 cases. Kansas has 23. So there's concern that the virus will keep spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: And do most cases involve people who are not vaccinated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Correct. The vast majority are not vaccinated. But here's something interesting. While we're hearing a lot about parents who don't want to vaccinate their kids, pediatricians I've been talking to are also hearing from worried parents who want their kids to get their vaccines early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: What do you mean by early?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: So normally, kids get their first measles vaccine between 12 and 15 months and then a second dose between 4 and 6 years. But the CDC says in certain situations, you can get the measles vaccine as young as 6 months, like if you're traveling abroad or are in an outbreak area. I spoke with Dr. Shannon Fox-Levine. She's a pediatrician in Broward County, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHANNON FOX-LEVINE: Our call center is - was inundated with calls about, you know, MMR vaccine. Is their child up to date? Should they get another vaccine? Should they get an extra one? Can they get it early?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: And this is in Florida, where vaccine hesitancy has been growing, so Fox-Levine says hearing vaccine enthusiasm is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: And why do you think there has been an uptick in enthusiasm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Well, two things - parents are watching what's happening with these outbreaks, and they're worried that measles will spread to where they live. You know, it is spring break season now, so people are traveling, and if you have kids who are too young for the vaccine, you might worry that you could run into someone with measles or that someone with measles could travel to your community. So these are the concerns pediatricians are hearing, but there's also politics at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: What do you mean? Like, what kind of politics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Well, several pediatricians told me they're hearing from parents who are worried about the future of vaccine access. These are parents who watch the news. They know that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been a longtime critic of vaccines. Here's Dr. Susan Sirota. She's a pediatrician in the Chicago area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUSAN SIROTA: There's a bit of fear among moms and dads and parents about their ability to protect their children and to prevent diseases because vaccine access is in question for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: And, you know, it's not just the measles vaccine. Sirota says some patients are worried about access to the HPV vaccine, which protects against cervical cancer. Kennedy has been involved in legal challenges to that vaccine. Now, during his confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he wouldn't take vaccines away from anyone. He's called them a personal choice. We did reach out to HHS for comment. They did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANG: That is NPR's Maria Godoy. Thank you so much, Maria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: My pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Using PET imaging, they found that dopamine levels spike in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex when people switch between tasks — and the more dopamine released, the more efficiently they adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confirms a biochemical link between dopamine and the brain’s ability to adjust behavior in response to changing demands. The discovery may help refine treatments for disorders like Parkinson’s, depression, ADHD, and schizophrenia, which often impair flexible thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine &amp;amp; Adaptability:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher dopamine release correlates with better task switching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Region Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; PET scans showed dopamine activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may guide treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired cognitive flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SNMMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time, scientists have confirmed a neurobiochemical link between dopamine and cognitive flexibility, according to new research published in the March issue of &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Nuclear Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PET imaging shows that the brain increases dopamine production when completing cognitively demanding tasks, and that the more dopamine released, the more efficiently the tasks are completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108271"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/dopamine-adaption-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dopamine release was calculated using the linearized simplified reference region model which compares the two task blocks with each other. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with this information, physicians may soon be able to develop more precise treatment strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive flexibility is the ability to adapt one’s thinking and behavior appropriately to a changing environment and is considered an aspect of executive function. Cognitive flexibility differs among people and is reported to be impaired in several psychiatric and neurologic disorders, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, addiction, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the neurotransmitter level, the dopamine system has been linked to cognitive flexibility. A direct neurochemical response to cognitive flexibility, however, has yet to be shown,” said Isabelle Miederer, PhD, associate professor in experimental nuclear medicine in the department of nuclear medicine at University Medical Center Mainz, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our study, we sought to examine the release of dopamine in real-time by performing PET scans while individuals completed behavioral flexibility tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen participants were scanned with the D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor ligand &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fallypride in a two-part block study design. In the first part, participants performed two tasks consecutively on a computer screen without rule switching while undergoing PET imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second part of the PET scan, participants had to switch flexibly between two task rules. Dopamine release was calculated using the linearized simplified reference region model which compares the two task blocks with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PET imaging analysis showed a displacement of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fallypride in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the task switching (higher cognitive demand) part of the study, which is assumed to be the release of dopamine. Results also showed that the greater dopamine release, the more efficient participants were in switching between tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The present findings emphasize the significance of dopamine in cognitive flexibility,” said Mathias Schreckenberger, MD, head of the department of nuclear medicine at University Medical Center Mainz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are consistent with the results of previous clinical studies indicating that dopamine deficiency in disorders such as Parkinson’s disease may cause behavioral deficits in cognitive flexibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking forward, it is expected that the results of the study will contribute to a better understanding of the neurochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility and thus facilitate the development of treatment strategies to improve flexibility in neurological and psychiatric disorders,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dopamine and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85f7e8e4fde0fcc5f6ebe8e8ecabeaf7e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rebecca Maxey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://snmmi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SNMMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rebecca Maxey – SNMMI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.124.268317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Cognitive Flexibility: An [18F]Fallypride PET Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Isabelle Miederer et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nuclear Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Cognitive Flexibility: An [18F]Fallypride PET Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive flexibility is the ability to appropriately adapt one’s thinking and behavior to changing environmental demands and is conceptualized as an aspect of executive function. The dopamine system has been implicated in cognitive flexibility; however, a direct, that is, neurochemical, link to cognitive flexibility has not been shown yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate how cognitive flexibility is mediated by dopaminergic signaling in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Eighteen participants were measured in a PET study with 174 ± 12 MBq of the D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor ligand [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride in a block design with 2 parts. While participants processed 2 tasks sequentially without rule switching on a computer screen in the first part of the PET scan, they had to flexibly switch between the 2 task rules after 100 min after injection in the second part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine release (γ) was quantified using the linearized simplified reference region model contrasting the 2 task blocks (switching vs. no-switching/baseline). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; The statistical analysis of the parametric γ-images showed that the increased cognitive demand during task switching induced a displacement of the D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor ligand [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride in the vmPFC (maximum T value = 13.8; cluster size: 528 voxels; familywise error rate–corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; mean γ = 0.022 ± 0.006 min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, a correlation between behavioral switch costs and vmPFC [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride displacement suggested that participants showing greater dopamine release were more efficient in task switching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; To our knowledge, this is the first experimental PET study to show direct involvement of dopamine in the vmPFC in a task-switching paradigm, confirming model assumptions about the neurochemical basis of cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 22:32:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1sZUlteXlHOFp6dDFZM1JpcE9UdF95c0lfZDVWTkEteDlpeUhTQ29mRXR3TU1XSWJIcTJITUl1RkZWTmlvcjhFdGdXZWdVLWNFWU5XektoUllVRGpxOXlzRnNqVlZGb2J5SWVVUWVOa2Y2OGJE</guid></item><item><title>You’re not eating enough protein if you have these 6 symptoms - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost every bodily function depends on protein. Every element of your body, including your hair and bones, contains proteins. They aid in the production and maintenance of cells, which are essential for development and growth. It is essential for the synthesis of enzymes, hormones, and antibodies and is a key component of muscles, skin, hair, and nails. However, a typical nutritional gap is a lack of protein. The following are the 6 typical indicators that your diet is lacking in protein: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weakness and fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sunil Rana, Associate Director and Head- Internal Medicine, Asian Hospital says, “Your body uses weakness and fatigue to indicate a protein shortage. Fatigue, low energy, and general weakness might result from your body not getting enough protein. Your body may not be getting enough protein to support your daily energy levels if you feel exhausted all the time, even after you've rested. “ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weak hair, skin and nails&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since proteins make up the majority of hair, skin, and nails, the condition of these tissues is one of the most obvious indicators of a deficit. You can have thinning hair or easily broken nails. Proteins like keratin, collagen, and elastin make up skin, hair, and nails. You may have dry and flaky skin, deep ridges on your fingernails, and brittle or thinning hair when your body is unable to produce them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Slow wound healing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dt. Debjani Banerjee, Incharge Dietetics, PSRI Hospital, “Slow wound healing and recurrent illness are two other typical signs of a protein shortage. Swelling (also known as edema), particularly in the hands, legs, feet, and abdomen, is one of the most typical indicators that you aren't receiving enough protein. Edema can be caused by a variety of factors, so be careful to consult your physician if you suspect something more serious. Your immune system may be compromised by a severe protein shortage. Protein aids in the production of antibodies, which guard against infections and other diseases. A lack of protein results in fewer antibodies, which raises your risk of infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mood swings&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, proteins are essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters that control mood and mental acuity. Mood fluctuations, impatience, and trouble focusing can all be caused by a protein shortage. Another typical sign of a protein shortage is mood swings. To convey information between cells, your brain employs chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are composed of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Therefore, eating too little protein would alter how your brain functions. For instance, you can experience depression or excessive aggression if your dopamine and serotonin levels are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uncontrolled cravings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent snack cravings, particularly for savory or sweet meals, may be your body's way of indicating a protein shortage. Your body uses skeletal muscle tissue as fuel when there is insufficient protein. Muscular atrophy, or a loss of muscular mass, results from this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Poor muscle mass&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, sustaining muscle mass, particularly as we age, requires protein. The body starts to break down muscular tissue for energy when it doesn't obtain enough protein from diet. Since muscles support and cushion the joints, this can result in muscular atrophy, weakening, and even joint discomfort. Insufficient protein intake may be the cause of joint pain or muscle loss. It frequently takes longer for cuts and scratches to heal in those who consume little protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprains and other injuries associated with exercise appear to be no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;10 symptoms you're having too much screen time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.’s Faulty Advice On Bird Flu - FactCheck.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE9pZVJyMnE0MUdNZTBiVF9oZ0JFTndRVzFiWXdTek4yNTRjaE5Yd3daN2pma1hjYTRudXFxOW8zUGwycmZJZXhnX25QRE9VRk54cUNjTUhwSm1vdUZpcVMwQVdTM2puNXZIN3RaQzFwNTBsN3M3akQtWA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Este artículo estará disponible en español &lt;a href="https://eltiempolatino.com/author/factcheck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;en El Tiempo Latino&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent news appearances, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/person/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; has suggested allowing bird flu to spread in poultry flocks unchecked. Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; that’s risky because it gives the virus more opportunities to replicate, increasing the chance it could change to spread easily among humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Avian influenza, or bird flu, has been &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/05/qa-on-h5n1-bird-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;spreading&lt;/a&gt; in U.S. dairy cows for more than a year now and has &lt;a href="https://archive.is/aFE8n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;infected&lt;/a&gt; several dozen dairy workers. The virus also has &lt;a href="https://archive.is/YHEcz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;infected&lt;/a&gt; flocks of chickens and other poultry in the U.S. since 2022, leading to the deaths of more than 168 million birds, infections in poultry workers and high &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/qa-on-egg-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;egg prices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We’ve in fact said to [the U.S. Department of Agriculture] that they should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds and preserve the birds that are immune to it,” Kennedy said of bird flu in an &lt;a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/watch/d5c0ee929861616db083854daa058a56/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel. The conversation aired March 4 on Fox Nation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of our scientists are against the culling operation,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in an interview with Sean Hannity, which aired on Fox News March 11. Kennedy advocated testing therapeutics in flocks and again suggested looking for birds with “a genetic inclination for immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have acknowledged that culling on its own &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-02-26/poultry-culling-hasnt-stopped-h5n1-bird-flu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;has not stopped&lt;/a&gt; bird flu from infecting poultry. But they &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/birdflu/114731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; is risky and unlikely to yield a breakthrough in the search for bird flu therapeutics or genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If someone is going to say well, we should let the virus just go unchecked and follow RFK Jr.’s suggestion, we’re going to exacerbate the problem,” &lt;a href="https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/maurice-ernest-pitesky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Maurice Pitesky&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at University of California, Davis, Veterinary Medicine Cooperative Extension, told us. “There’s no scenario where that is a good idea.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Why do we want to give the virus a leg up? Why do we want to give it an advantage and let it do its worst without being checked?” &lt;a href="https://www.pirbright.ac.uk/our-science/scientists/prof-ian-brown-obe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ian Brown&lt;/a&gt;, group leader of avian virology at the Pirbright Institute in the U.K., asked us. “That doesn’t feel terribly logical.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letting bird flu run through poultry flocks is “not advisable and this will cause serious harm to poultry and put other animals at risk, but also humans who will have to manage the culling/clean-up, which poses a huge biosecurity risk,” &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/popescu-saskia/"&gt;Saskia Popescu&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told us in an email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Kennedy left out important context about the risk of bird flu. And he misleadingly claimed that vaccinating poultry would turn birds into “mutation factories,” when researchers say that vaccinating birds could be one possible way of mitigating agricultural harm and reducing risks to people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is in charge of HHS, not the USDA, so it is unclear how much his views will influence the policy on culling or vaccinating birds. On the human health side, lawmakers and scientists recently have raised concerns that HHS is threatening pandemic preparedness by pulling back &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-government-pulls-back-over-11-billion-funding-state-health-departments-2025-03-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;funding to states&lt;/a&gt; being used to control infectious disease, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/health-department-job-layoffs-rfk-jr.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;embarking on&lt;/a&gt; a massive reduction in HHS staff and reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/hhs-moderna-vaccine-contract-bird-flu-pandemic-preparedness-worries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reevaluating&lt;/a&gt; a contract for research into bird flu mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins in a Feb. 26 Fox News &lt;a href="https://x.com/AmericaNewsroom/status/1894798813681827949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; indicated USDA might try out a pilot program to build a “safe perimeter” around some flocks to “see if there is a way forward where the immunity and the genetics and the DNA become part of this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the USDA affirmed to us via email that its policy is still to require culling. “The United States will continue to follow our established stamping out policy,” in keeping with international &lt;a href="https://www.woah.org/en/what-we-do/standards/codes-and-manuals/terrestrial-code-online-access/?id=169&amp;amp;L=1&amp;amp;htmfile=chapitre_avian_influenza_viruses.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, an agency spokesperson said, and also will work to “develop innovative strategies (including alternative response activities) and ensure we use every tool at our disposal” to fight bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In late February, the USDA &lt;a href="https://archive.is/HY0SY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a $1 billion strategy to combat bird flu, which &lt;a href="https://archive.is/rSXDT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;includes&lt;/a&gt; funds dedicated to developing vaccines for poultry and for improving biosecurity on farms. Good biosecurity can help prevent bird flu from being introduced to farms in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting Bird Flu Spread in Poultry Is Risky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;H5N1 bird flu — the type causing the current outbreak in the U.S. — spreads rapidly in chickens and is &lt;a href="https://archive.is/WhPDJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;highly lethal&lt;/a&gt;. USDA &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/depopulationpolicy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; is to kill all the birds in a flock once H5N1 is detected. This culling process, also referred to as depopulation, reduces bird flu’s ability replicate, mutate and spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his interview with Hannity, Kennedy blamed high egg prices on culling. “We’ve killed 166 million chickens,” Kennedy said. “That’s why we have an egg crisis.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But bird flu is the root cause of the bird deaths. These birds “would die anyway if they were not depopulated,” Brown said, explaining that the “lethality is pretty close to 100%.” The hens would stop laying eggs early in their infection, he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When infection is allowed to take its course, poultry “die quite a horrible death,” Brown said, so there is also an animal welfare issue with not culling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most likely outcome of stopping culling, Pitesky said, would be more bird deaths as the virus spread unchecked, ultimately reducing the country’s food security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The quicker you depopulate, the quicker you can prevent disease transmission from that facility to other facilities or to wild birds that are in that area that are then going to transmit the disease to other facilities,” Pitesky said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stopping culling could increase the risk of bird flu changing in dangerous ways. “The more opportunities the virus has to replicate, the more opportunities it has to mutate and reassort with all kinds of different strains,” Pitesky said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy was also wrong to almost entirely blame bird flu cases in humans on culling. “Almost all of the people who have gotten sick were workers who were involved in the culling operations,” he told Siegel. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s inaccurate,” Popescu said. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 24 out of 70 U.S. human bird flu cases cave been in people &lt;a href="https://archive.is/aFE8n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt; via poultry farms and culling operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been cases “related to culling, but this is also in relation to poultry exposure overall – culling is a necessary practice to avoid additional exposure (humans and animals), and frankly it’s a horrific illness for birds,” Popescu said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy Unlikely to Identify Flu-Resistant Chickens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers said that stopping culling in order to find resistant birds or new therapeutics was unlikely to be effective. “People have been trying to breed genetic lines that are resistant to flu for some years now and have generally failed to succeed,” Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There has been research into whether some birds might have genes that could provide flu resistance, Pitesky said, but this work is done in poultry being raised in villages in Africa and Asia that have more genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commercial chickens in the U.S. are bred to be as genetically identical as possible so that they will grow at the same rate, Pitesky added. These poultry are the “least ideal population” to test whether it’s possible to identify birds with genetic resistance to H5N1, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pitesky also said that before testing a therapeutic in the field, “you ultimately need some indication that it’s going to work.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The biggest issue is we don’t have anything in the pipeline right now, as far as I know, that there’s any indication it could be curative of a viral infection like this in poultry,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown said that there have been concerns about whether therapeutics for chickens could be cost-effective, “even if they could do the job, which I doubt.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I do think we do need to think outside the box, but that is not a viable outside-the-box scenario,” Pitesky said, referring to Kennedy’s proposal for finding resistant chickens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccinating Poultry Could Curb Bird Flu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One possible way to protect chickens would be to vaccinate them, Brown said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in his conversation with Hannity, Kennedy misleadingly dismissed vaccination as a strategy that could harm human health. “All of my agencies have advised against vaccination of birds because if you vaccinate with a leaky vaccine — in other words, a vaccine that does not provide sterilizing immunity, that does not absolutely protect against the disease — you turn those flocks into mutation factories,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown said that vaccination would reduce illness in birds and their ability to spread the virus. Bird flu vaccines do not completely prevent infection, and vaccination could favor versions of the virus that aren’t as well targeted by the vaccine. However, there isn’t evidence that vaccination would “generate some monster virus that can infect people,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poultry vaccines are available, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/french-bird-flu-vaccine-campaign-helps-poultry-output-recover-producers-say-2025-02-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2023/02/17/bird-flu-vaccination-policies-by-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; Mexico, France, Egypt and China use vaccines against bird flu in poultry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “claim that poultry vaccination will ‘turn those birds into mutant factories’ is incorrect,” virologist &lt;a href="https://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/bmi-affiliated/angela-rasmussen.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angela Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Saskatchewan said in a social media &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/UQK8-UZ3T" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccination in China against another type of bird flu virus, H7N9, did &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/2DZB-6XUX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;favor&lt;/a&gt; survival of flu genotypes that could evade the vaccine, she said. But researchers found that the “variants that emerged were less adapted to infect humans,” Rasmussen said, and &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/4J56-58X6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vaccinating&lt;/a&gt; the birds “basically stopped human infections.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So yes, RNA viruses like flu can mutate &amp;amp; vaccination creates selection pressures driving their evolution,” Rasmussen &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/YJM4-JU2U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “But that doesn’t turn chickens into mutant factories &amp;amp; reduces the risk to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are policy and logistical &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/20/h5n1-bird-flu-egg-prices-former-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-biosecurity-vaccines-new-normal/"&gt;barriers&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinating chickens in the U.S. Brown explained, for instance, that some countries do not allow imports from countries that vaccinate their poultry. The laying industry in the U.S. does not have a substantial export business and is for vaccinating poultry. The meat industry, also called the broiler industry, exports large quantities of chicken and is against vaccination due to the trade embargoes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we’ve written, USDA is funding vaccine research. In response to a March 26 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a39tYB91NJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; from Forbes about Kennedy’s poultry vaccine comments, asked during an impromptu interview outside the White House, Rollins did not comment specifically but emphasized that multiple agencies would work together to curb bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks of Bird Flu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://archive.is/E0l0E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://archive.is/HV5qd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; currently consider the risk of H5N1 bird flu to the general public to be low. However, public health experts still &lt;a href="https://archive.is/ExJxs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that people take precautions, such as avoiding raw milk and using caution around wild birds and other potentially infected animals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists also have emphasized that the risk level of bird flu &lt;a href="https://archive.is/5dlV3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/bird-flu-america-death.html?unlocked_article_code=1.6k4.u3Jf.JV8nun8aMOP6&amp;amp;smid=url-share&amp;amp;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;change very quickly&lt;/a&gt; if the virus changes to more readily infect and spread among humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy — who has advocated &lt;a href="https://archive.is/d1ImN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;deregulating&lt;/a&gt; raw milk in the past — left out this context in talking about the food supply. “It’s not transmitted through eggs or through dairy products,” he told Siegel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know, you cannot get it from an egg or milk or meat from an infected animal,” he said to Hannity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been no documented human cases of bird flu in the U.S. resulting from eating eggs, milk or meat. Birds with flu stop laying eggs early in the course of their infection, and the virus isn’t found in high amounts in eggs, Pitesky said. For eggs, “I’d be more concerned about salmonella than I would about avian influenza,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Dairy is different,” Pitesky said, saying that raw milk is “dangerous,” both due to the potential presence of bird flu and due to other microbes. In cows, bird flu is found at the highest levels in the udder and milk. Pasteurization kills the bird flu virus, but it has been shown to persist in raw milk and raw milk products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cats have &lt;a href="https://archive.is/f04HN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; from H5N1 bird flu after drinking raw milk. “If someone is going to tell me, let’s wait until a human dies … I’m not willing to take that chance,” Pitesky said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Raw meat pet foods have also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/04/h5n1-avian-flu-cats-transmission-pets-companion-animals-disease-surveillance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; cats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also said that B3.13, the version of bird flu that spread to cows in late 2023, is “not very dangerous to humans,” adding that it “is not something that we’re deeply concerned about.” He said to Siegel that the D1.1 version of the virus, which has been found in wild birds and poultry and also recently spread to cow herds, is “more dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To date, the B3.13 genotype has caused mild disease in humans. D1.1 and a related version of the virus, called D1.3, have led to &lt;a href="https://archive.is/kYP5f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;three severe bird flu cases&lt;/a&gt; in humans in the U.S., including one &lt;a href="https://archive.is/LrBi7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. The severe cases occurred in two people with backyard &lt;a href="https://archive.is/SAl5P" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt; and one worker who was culling diseased poultry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, scientists cautioned against complacency in the response to any version of the virus. “It only needs to acquire a couple of mutations” to become more dangerous to humans, Brown said. “That risk profile might change.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Epidemiologists like me are wary of drawing premature conclusions about severity,” Caitlin Rivers of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health wrote in a recent New York Times &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/bird-flu-america-death.html"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt;. She cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from small numbers of cases occurring largely in dairy workers, when people with high-risk health conditions or the very old or young might be underrepresented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I fear that the apparent mildness of infections in the United States has confounded calls to act more decisively,” Rivers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want to up your potassium game, stock up on jackfruit, prunes, guava, and kiwi. Mixing in a variety of these fruits will help you hit your daily potassium goals and make your diet more flavorful and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, which of these are you adding to your next grocery run?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At least &lt;strong&gt;41 people&lt;/strong&gt; have been hospitalized so far.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An unvaccinated, but otherwise healthy child, died of measles in February, becoming the &lt;strong&gt;first measles fatality&lt;/strong&gt; in the U.S. in a decade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just two cases have occurred in people fully vaccinated, according to the data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Friday’s updates come after the Trump administration abruptly canceled more than &lt;strong&gt;$11 billion&lt;/strong&gt; in COVID-era public health grants, a move that state and local health departments said could harm Texas’s measles response.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Departments are already operating on &lt;strong&gt;thin margins&lt;/strong&gt; and need to balance sometimes competing public health priorities. Due to the loss, some health departments are already starting to cancel contracts and lay off workers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Grants were used for information modernization, as well as to hire people to help with vaccinations, testing and disease tracking. But that work had to &lt;strong&gt;stop immediately&lt;/strong&gt;.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, said &lt;strong&gt;grant money&lt;/strong&gt; was going to be used to help equip a new lab that is being built. The new equipment would have expanded the lab’s testing capacity for COVID-19, as well as other pathogens, like measles.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This is going to stop work in its tracks that was really important for their communities,” said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“Work to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in nursing homes, for example, or to be able to track measles cases … the work has to stop, and yet the needs in the community remain,” Casalotti said.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hill</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 21:36:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNMGhlRlA3eFRieVdFX3F1SVBrQmR0blJlc2oxRHVkZW1wTDBDSnBLek9fOVlfWG9zQU1vT3pBNldCNmhmZW4wd19mZV9naE1BZVBFUzlQSjQ1OExLeHcxV2QwQ1ZIRVdnTUFEYnB2eDhEZUFMVHE0dXZJU1dxY3NDWjZxb2RzaTNvNmfSAY8BQVVfeXFMTUhLaTAxMWZleUtZeVg4cHIwNEVEY3BjdE1jS2F3QXUzXzZaTlhBOWNWN0RBRG5Yb3o4Y0FpSlJjYjgyUHhrTGZjNlJDOE0zaFgwM3o1Vk5CWU82dVVERHdWWjgzeGxJVU9EcTZoSWd5SWJXY01JdHZld0taUHVCOEN5MWVNeWx4SDYtXzFKdG8</guid></item><item><title>Is It Healthy To Eat Yogurt Every Day?

Whether we’re blitzing it into a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a39576599/blueberry-smoothie-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, grabbing it from the cold case at a local cafe, or shoving a cup into our bag as we run out the door on a busy morning, we opt for it because we’re confident in its stunning nutritional resume and relative ease of consumption—especially when we’re &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/g43725813/grab-and-go-breakfast-ideas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:on the go;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;on the go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is it possible that we’ve become overconfident? Is yogurt really the nutritional powerhouse we believe it is? And, even if it is, is it possible to get too much of a good thing? As someone who personally LOVES &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a27059031/instant-pot-yogurt-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:yogurt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt; (and eats it very often), I take these questions very seriously, so I took a deep dive into the topic, consulting two nutritionists and reading countless articles. Here’s everything you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Let’s talk about that STUNNING nutritional resume:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying it: yogurt brings some amazing health benefits. According to registered dietitian &lt;a href="http://www.jessicacordingnutrition.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jessica Cording&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, dairy-based yogurt is a great source of calcium, vitamin B-12, riboflavin, potassium, and phosphorus. It also has a lot of protein (depending on the type and brand, a 5.3-ounce serving can contain up to &lt;a href="https://usa.fage/products/yogurt/fage-total-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:16 grams;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;16 grams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!) and, since most dairy in the United States is fortified with vitamin D, it’s a good source of that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many types of yogurt also contain probiotics, aka beneficial bacteria, which, according to registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://crossfit26.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kim Yawitz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kim Yawitz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “help optimize the balance between good and bad microorganisms in your gut.” Yawitz shares that eating probiotic-rich yogurt can potentially help to “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-025-93603-3&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.delish.com%2Ffood%2Fa64144233%2Fis-it-healthy-to-eat-yogurt-every-day-experts-weigh-in%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fend off intestinal infections;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;fend off intestinal infections&lt;/a&gt;, relieve symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1494118/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:irritable bowel syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/regular-yogurt-consumption-may-reduce-colon-cancer-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce the risk of colon cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduce the risk of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;.” Between the gut health benefits, all those vitamins and minerals, and the boost of protein, it might seem like eating a cup of yogurt every morning is a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;However... (let’s not get carried away!)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all yogurt is created equal. While yogurt can have great health benefits, its specific nutritional value vastly varies depending on what yogurt you’re consuming. For example, only some types of yogurt carry the live probiotics that are so good for the gut. Yawitz shares that most naturally-occurring probiotics in yogurt actually die when the yogurt is pasteurized, so the only types of yogurt that still contain them are those where the manufacturers have actually added the bacteria back into the yogurt after it was pasteurized. These refortified yogurts are set up to benefit our gut health; anything that doesn’t tout “live probiotics” on the packaging won’t do your gut any good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a specific yogurt’s nutritional value can vary wildly depending on the amount of added sugar. According to Yawitz, a “seemingly innocent fruit-flavored yogurt” can contain “just as much added sugar as a serving of ice cream.” Don’t believe it? Check out the nutrition facts for this popular brand’s &lt;a href="https://www.yoplait.com/products/original-single-serve-strawberry" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6-ounce container of strawberry yogurt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6-ounce container of strawberry yogurt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: it contains only 5 grams protein and a whopping 18 grams sugar. For comparison, a serving of this brand’s &lt;a href="https://smartlabel.unileverusa.com/077567226006-0001-en-US/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vanilla ice cream;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vanilla ice cream&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also contains (you guessed it!) 18 grams sugar. I don’t know about you, but given the option, I’d probably take the ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly yogurt has the potential to be a great healthy option on any (and every) weekday morning, but it’s not necessarily a given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what do you buy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few good rules of thumb to follow when choosing your morning “cuppa yo’.” Here’s what to look for, whether you’re cruising the dairy aisle or snagging a container at your local coffee shop:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go high-protein.&lt;/strong&gt; Maximizing yogurt’s high-protein potential is especially important if you’re hoping to sustain your energy until lunch. Cording often recommends Greek or Icelandic-style yogurt since these varieties are both “higher in protein and will help you feel full for longer.” But she does note that these high-protein yogurts aren’t everyone’s favorite, and that if you prefers the texture of plain, non-Greek-style yogurt, you shouldn’t feel obligated to opt for it for the sake of a little extra protein. Instead, she recommends incorporating a little extra protein from other sources into that morning meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid the added sugars. &lt;/strong&gt;Unless you actually want dessert for breakfast (and there’s definitely a time and place for that!), follow Cording’s recommendation and opt for “unflavored” over flavored (i.e. sweetened) yogurts. But if you really hate plain yogurt, don’t despair: Cording recommends looking for lower-sugar options or ones that use “natural sugar alternatives like allulose, monk fruit, and stevia.” She also suggests plain and flavored yogurt together and gradually adjusting the ratios over time so “your tastebuds adjust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep it cultured.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you’re actually getting all the probiotic benefits by checking the labels ensure your yogurt has been refortified with those bacteria. Yawitz recommends looking for products with the words “live and active cultures” on the label and specific strains of bacteria in the ingredients list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogurt has the potential to be a highly healthy addition to your diet, but it’s absolutely not a given. Double check the label on your carton next time to make sure you’re doubling down on the full benefits of your morning cup of yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:57:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5IVE9fWjAybi1JUG9sQkxDTEZsUXhFYUUzVHBXVHo5Z0lCS09jYVpJNmxld3VpWlcyVUZnR2tVMWt5RDBvemc2WEo5ZWlUdjRMYVhrektMRGdLX3ljVkJOQ2xNS200c2hrSXhDRjR0bDE</guid></item><item><title>‘Clean your plate’ leads to problems; doctor offers ways to encourage healthy eating in kids - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxNVE5wSW5sN2JZLUtrQzA0RHU4YzkyOVlCT19tZm04dWJ1RVhVOFh6LWNMb25oWGJzR3oySlJSSGl4cVoxSXdGQzhLOWdUVGlJTkt4aGhBbGxfdjEzamNHRV94ZjhuVG1tbUVQNHYxdEFEd092VlVNZG9UMUdOcC1pQklyMDF3eVpjR19hb0RRMVo1ZHZiRDZYUUU4MFJTWWFEcmh0QzE5bllGb1JzUUJ5Yk02MXRhSFhxc0o3dVIyeV9McXBzNHV4QVNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;One local doctor offers is offering ways to encourage healthy eating in kids as food rules could lead to overeating, food anxiety or eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;For generations, well-meaning parents have resorted to an arsenal of food rules, including “clean your plate before you leave the table,” to try to get their children to eat a well-balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My parents said the same thing to me,” said &lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/providers/michelearthurs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Michele Arthurs&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician with Kaiser Permanente in Temple Hills, Maryland. “When we’re looking at the overall relationship with food, we want to rethink that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forcing children to finish their food can teach them to ignore natural hunger and fullness signals that are built-in for humans. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over time, this can contribute to overeating, and food anxiety, and sometimes even eating disorders,” said Arthurs. “It’s important for our kids to learn how to stop eating when they feel satisfied, not when they feel too full.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, March is &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/about-national-nutrition-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Nutrition Month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making healthy food available at the dinner table is a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important for our children to be exposed to all the food groups — different vegetables, different fruits, different whole grains, different sources of protein,” said Arthurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having a little bit of a trial on the plate can be helpful — invite that,” she suggested. “It doesn’t have to always be accepted by our child. We might have to try 30 times before the new food, no matter what color it is, is indeed sampled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the problem with food rules?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a parent insists a child eat their food, “it can create a relationship with food that feels antagonistic,” Arthurs said. “The child does not have control over that particular situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, she said the goal is to empower young eaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to their own choices for food, that they have control over that. That they understand the purpose of food — that’s it’s more than just how it tastes, that it’s there to nourish their body,” Arthurs said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects can be long-lasting. A child who is forced to eat vegetables is likely to become an adult who doesn’t want to eat vegetables, and “that’s a hard habit to undo,” said Arthurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empower children at the grocery store&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than imposing edicts at the dinner table, Arthurs said there are easy ways to help children develop a healthy relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If they’re coming with us to the grocery store, we can play ‘Where’s Waldo’ with food,” she suggests. As an example: “I’m looking for a food that’s red, that’s sweet, that has tiny little seeds on the side, and is high in all these wonderful vitamins and nutrients that we need — what might that be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The answer, by the way, is “strawberries.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea is to look for ways to remind children about the benefits of healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of kids say, ‘I want to grow up to be big and strong.’ And you can answer, ‘What are the foods on your plate that are going to support that?'” said Arthurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"&gt;Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts’ assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0"&gt;In an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"&gt;A CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment “because it does not say anything that the public doesn’t already know.” She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"&gt;But what the nation’s top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0"&gt;“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” the statement said, echoing a line from a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;column Kennedy wrote&lt;/a&gt; for the Fox News website. “People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0"&gt;ProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0"&gt;“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0"&gt;For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html"&gt;promoted them with confidence&lt;/a&gt;. One campaign was called “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm"&gt;Get My Flu Shot&lt;/a&gt;.” The agency’s website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html"&gt;told medical providers&lt;/a&gt; they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0"&gt;Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0"&gt;Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0"&gt;When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’ communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes — nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"&gt;Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0"&gt;The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0"&gt;Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0"&gt;In late February, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html"&gt;forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1&lt;/a&gt; bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general U.S. population, they said, was low.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0"&gt;In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the U.S. is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0"&gt;The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0"&gt;This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0"&gt;The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0"&gt;Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0"&gt;During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;NPR reported&lt;/a&gt; this.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"&gt;But some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0"&gt;On the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB"&gt;child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/"&gt;downplayed the seriousness&lt;/a&gt; of the outbreak. “We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0"&gt;In an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. “They’re seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0"&gt;As parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/"&gt;only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0"&gt;Still, the CDC added &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;an entry on Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; to its measles website for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"&gt;On Wednesday, CNN reported that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/texas-measles-vitamin-a-toxicity/index.html"&gt;several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function&lt;/a&gt;, a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0"&gt;Texas health officials also said that the Trump administration’s decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/26/texas-measles-public-health-funding-cut/"&gt;will hinder their ability to respond&lt;/a&gt; to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0"&gt;Measles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt; with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html"&gt;linger in the air&lt;/a&gt; for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0"&gt;This week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles &lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/amtrak-confirms-passenger-measles-traveled-new-york-washington-dc/16085440/"&gt;rode one of its trains&lt;/a&gt; from New York City to Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
        
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ProPublica</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9mTVVhZHdpUHpEUkJEZUI2bXFWZ2R2dkVfNXRfOFZISG1qQ1U1czFzRzhtLTE0d2ZCTjZISlpQdkxFdWQxU3FTQ0ppTkpiZ19ydUVOWDZLbFA0b0FLZGxYZGVKa1JkZ09ZN3FiOFc4VjdUTHc</guid></item></channel></rss>
