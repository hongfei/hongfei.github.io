          &lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen this in major media yet (except CBS), nor here, but this story is spreading on Facebook and in Europe today: (CBS) &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-reports-cases-new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-behind-surge-china/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;U.S. reports cases of new COVID variant NB.1.8.1 behind surge in China&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;'s airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks. . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts have been &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md#global-overview" target="_blank"&gt;closely watching&lt;/a&gt; the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a "significant increase" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to see the CDC is still on the job (NO snark intended).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Daily Express (US version) is also alarming: &lt;a href="https://www.the-express.com/news/health/172633/new-covid-19-variant-nb181-detected-china-us-airports" target="_blank" title=""&gt;New Covid variant lands in US after ripping through countries, killing some in Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is yet to be evidence that this new variant is more severe, but authorities in Hong Kong say they have already begun urging locals to wear masks in crowded places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has also reported a rise in emergency room visits, including severe cases and deaths, and the country's health authorities have said they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, The Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee unanimously recommended that the newest vaccines for Covid should be updated to target a variant of strains currently on the rise, including NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting on Thursday was the first the Administration has had since President Trump took office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The (UK) Economic Times also has some details: &lt;a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-spreading-in-u-s-is-it-more-dangerous-do-vaccines-work-and-whats-the-fatality-rate/articleshow/121369143.cms" target="_blank" title=""&gt;COVID variant NB.1.8.1 spreading in U.S.: is it more dangerous, do vaccines work, and what's the fatality rate?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answers: It does not &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; to be more severe than previous variants, but it spreads more rapidly. Also, “Early data suggests that updated vaccines targeting related variants such as LP.8.1 may be beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, there is no sign that NB.1.8.1 causes more severe illness than previous strains. But what it lacks in evasiveness, it may make up for in speed. Early research from China suggests the variant binds more effectively to human cells, which could make it more contagious than its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By coincidence, during a routine exam last week my doctor suggested getting a COVID booster, which I did. Consult your doctor or other health care to consider doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

The idea was that this vitamin, vital for basic metabolic functions, might turn into a very reactive intermediate during certain biochemical processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have shown that the hunch was correct. &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/vincentl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prof. Vincent Lavallo&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California, Riverside (&lt;a href="https://www.ucr.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCR&lt;/a&gt;), led the investigation that confirms vitamin B1 can form a reactive species called a carbene, even in watery surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-vitamin-b1-and-carbenes"&gt;Understanding vitamin B1 and carbenes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00001a054"&gt;Carbenes&lt;/a&gt; have only six valence electrons on the carbon atom. They are known for being so reactive that they often vanish moments after forming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water, which normally disrupts these molecules almost instantly, was never thought to be a friendly environment for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time anyone has been able to observe a stable carbene in water. People thought this was a crazy idea. But it turns out, Breslow was right,” said Lavallo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thiamine is key to &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/b16594/introduction-nutrition-metabolism-david-bender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fundamental tasks&lt;/a&gt; in the body, including the breakdown of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bumblebees-choose-immediate-rewards-over-energy-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugars for energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-so-much-doubt-for-so-long"&gt;Why so much doubt for so long?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbenes were long considered too unstable for water because of how quickly they react. Even trace moisture in the air could destroy them before scientists had a chance to study them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most early attempts to observe carbenes in water ended in failure. They either disappeared or broke apart into other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-molecule-discovery-will-force-textbooks-to-be-rewritten/"&gt;molecules&lt;/a&gt;, reinforcing the belief that they simply couldn’t last in water-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That skepticism ran deep. Researchers preferred to work with these molecules in dry, oxygen-free environments using special lab setups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This made the idea of observing them in water, let alone storing them, sound like science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-fresh-approach-to-working-in-water"&gt;A fresh approach to working in water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A carbene in water seemed &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cr400640e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;impossible&lt;/a&gt; because water usually attacks such electron-poor carbon centers right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were making these reactive molecules to explore their chemistry, not chasing a historical theory, but it turns out our work ended up confirming exactly what Breslow proposed all those years ago,” said &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Varun-Tej-Raviprolu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Varun Raviprolu&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues developed a special chemical covering – a molecular shield – to keep the carbene from making contact with water. This shield prevented immediate breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1958-theory-turned-out-to-be-true"&gt;1958 theory turned out to be true&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemist &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01547a064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ronald Breslow&lt;/a&gt; suggested ages ago that thiamine might transform into a carbene during certain body reactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one could prove it. The new findings show that under the right conditions, the carbene form of vitamin b1 is stable enough to observe with advanced tools like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-can-now-trace-forever-chemicals-back-to-their-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nuclear magnetic resonance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say this stability helps explain how crucial transformations occur in living cells. Their protective strategy shows that the body could be forming short-lived carbene intermediates during routine metabolic tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eco-friendly-b1-manufacturing"&gt;Eco-friendly B1 manufacturing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These carbenes can serve as ligands in metal-based catalysts, which are widely used to produce many substances. Carbenes in water may open a path to cleaner processes, thanks to reduced dependence on harmful solvents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Water is the ideal solvent – it’s abundant, non-toxic, and environmentally friendly. If we can get these powerful catalysts to work in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-molecule-discovery-will-force-textbooks-to-be-rewritten/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, that’s a big step toward greener chemistry,” said Raviprolu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These catalysts could transform how pharmaceuticals and everyday materials are produced. Some industry reactions are notorious for generating chemical waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By harnessing water-based techniques, the hope is to cut costs and avoid safety concerns linked to flammable liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mimicking-life-s-chemistry-in-the-lab"&gt;Mimicking life’s chemistry in the lab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living cells rely on complex, water-based reactions to keep the body running. Many of those reactions involve fast, reactive intermediates that are hard to detect or replicate in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Lavallo’s team managed to stabilize a molecule that mimics this behavior could help researchers recreate cellular chemistry more accurately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means a better grasp of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cruelty-free-foie-gras-made-with-enzymes-not-force-feeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how enzymes work&lt;/a&gt; and possibly new ways to repair or reprogram those functions in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbenes are often studied for their ability to mimic parts of enzyme action. Now that scientists can make them behave in watery environments, they might start finding ways to control them for specific biological tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could eventually change how we design &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/spider-venom-has-hidden-biochemical-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;enzyme-inspired&lt;/a&gt; drugs or materials that react only under the same conditions found inside human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-with-vitamin-b1"&gt;Next steps with vitamin B1&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proving that carbene intermediates can survive in water solves a riddle about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tomatoes-could-become-an-important-source-of-vitamin-d/"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; b1’s potential. It also raises new questions about other fleeting molecules that may exist in living systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lavallo and his team hope that a similar method might reveal more hidden players involved in major biological reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something that seems impossible today might be possible tomorrow, if we continue to invest in science,” said Raviprolu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding suggests that nobody should dismiss theories, no matter how far-fetched, without thorough research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr9681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 20:45:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOaEZzRllkUmU0cHV5T19YTEx6UXBIYlItdG9reUI0TnA4V2poaEdBQTBCaFQ2Ni1JUlo5ZkdOcG1maHY3cDlTTl92ak5qVzl4WTJtOFBNZFdaWXZ6Rk5zMm9JdzFtY1d3NTdRVlNxVVJQMHpGSTlSeFROcUZvdGtXMkRib0N3WFBGeGcxaVVQNlFjOUw3MmVjR0NlaEZoX1lYUWkwaQ</guid></item><item><title>一名患有麻疹的国际旅行者在传染期间访问了爱达荷州的多个地点- KTVB | An international traveler with measles visited multiple Idaho locations during infectious period - KTVB</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAJBVV95cUxQZlk4eS1oX2JOVnBMT3JHZkJtYmNXWTdrMXY3TGNFcEVybmhsNnRoYmMwREoxNVp3eTVtaklhanR6S3pmZEFnUGx0QnhuMzdOS3hWNnlMdW5lS0oxY2pEMzU3TDR4MVZYcWl2aXdhRXVjd1hKbW1Eall4c2w1ellSeFNXUS1jWndQdFZOWVh2VGdCMjdWS3l4bUM2Z1gzWEVyY0RBYWJ3R3BPRU9oa2VQd0QxaDhBRThicmprcko5MF8zVGhheXpRZy00c0NaemRRS2ttQVEwUndyMm5mcWRacFAwSFZNdXhURzdqaEI0czRrZFJJSEFHNDAxbGlwZGJ3eUNXYlZNVW1uMVZlZ3FYXzJOZ0k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The visitor spent time at Burley establishments during their infectious period.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURLEY, Idaho — Health officials are investigating a measles case involving an international business traveler who visited several locations in south-central Idaho while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their infectious period, the out-of-state visitor spent time at three Burley establishments: EdgeWater Dining and Spirits on Monday evening, an urgent care clinic on Tuesday morning and Intermountain Health Cassia Regional Hospital on Tuesday morning and afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the South Central Public Health District, anyone exposed to measles at these locations could develop symptoms between Saturday and June 14. Officials are notifying identified contacts, though some brief exposures may not have been captured in the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traveler visited EdgeWater Dining and Spirits at 530 Hampton Drive between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Monday. On Tuesday, they went to Urgent Care of Idaho's Burley Clinic at 382 Overland Ave. between 8:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., then to Cassia Regional Hospital at 1501 Hiland Ave. between 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urgent care clinic shares a waiting room with two other businesses, potentially expanding exposure risk. The hotel where the individual stayed has notified guests who were present during the relevant timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary findings indicate the infected person received a childhood measles vaccination. While breakthrough cases in vaccinated individuals are rare, emerging data suggest these cases tend to be less severe and less infectious than infections in unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are focused on working with state and local health organizations in this ongoing investigation," said Tanis Maxwell, the health district's family and children's health director. "Our priority is to keep the public informed and to support anyone who may have been exposed."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. The virus can survive in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves. Patients remain contagious from four days before until four days after the characteristic rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough and rash. The disease is highly contagious and can spread rapidly in communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If symptoms develop, people who may have been exposed should monitor for symptoms for 21 days and contact their healthcare provider. Those experiencing measles symptoms should call ahead before visiting medical facilities to allow staff to prepare isolation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is highly effective, with one dose providing about 93% protection and two doses offering 97% effectiveness. Health officials encourage residents to verify their MMR vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman in the U.S. has died from severe neurological symptoms that were caused by an abnormal protein — which she was unknowingly injected with nearly 50 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having shown no neurological symptoms in the decades since the injection, the 58-year-old recently began experiencing tremors and changes in her ability to balance while walking. In the following weeks, she developed urinary incontinence, difficulty speaking and abnormal breathing. After being admitted to hospital, she entered a coma and later died, according to a&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article" data-url="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;case report published May 14 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article#suggestedcitation" target="_blank" data-url="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/24-1519_article#suggestedcitation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up MRI scan while she was in hospital revealed damage to her brain, and further testing showed positive results for an abnormal protein called a prion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prions are found in cell membranes, the wall that surrounds every one of our cells, and are thought to be one of the molecules &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2653553/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2653553/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;involved in cellular communication and other interactions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though prions can exist safely in the body, when these proteins accumulate in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/29365-human-brain.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/29365-human-brain.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they can cause surrounding proteins to contort and "misfold," damaging nerve cells.

People with this condition have a lack of hormones produced by the pituitary gland, the&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23935-panhypopituitarism" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23935-panhypopituitarism" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;organ that secretes a range of hormones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; including those involved in growth and sexual development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, panhypopituitarism was treated by injecting patients with human growth hormones extracted from the healthy pituitary glands of people who had died. At the time, this was common practice — as well as being used to treat pituitary conditions,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6616070/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6616070/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;hormones from cadavers were also given to women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whose ovaries were not producing eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in 1985 researchers identified the first U.S. outbreak of CJD related to treatments with cadaver-derived growth hormones. The treatment was quickly suspended, and later a synthetic&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/19/us/synthetic-growth-hormone-cleared.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/19/us/synthetic-growth-hormone-cleared.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;alternative hormone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, produced by genetic engineering, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/6/12-0116_article" data-url="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/6/12-0116_article" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;0.4% of those treated in the U.S&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with growth hormones taken from the organs of deceased individuals have gone on to develop CJD. How these hormones were infected with prions is still unknown, and scientists cannot yet explain why there is such a long latency period between the infection and the symptoms arising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no treatment available to those with CJD, or any other form of prion disease.

But while the pandemic has officially ended, the elevated death toll has persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers blame the ongoing crisis on a combination of drug overdoses, gun violence, traffic accidents, and chronic diseases like heart failure and diabetes, all of which are hitting the US harder than other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also cited the lack of a robust social safety net — common in many European countries — as a major factor worsening the toll. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers said the uptick was linked to surging overdose deaths from drugs among other factors. Pictured above are people suffering from drug dependency in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows people suffering from drug dependency in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They were pictured on May 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jacob Bor, an epidemiologist who led the research, said: 'The US has been in a protracted health crisis for decades, with health outcomes far worse than other high-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This longer-run tragedy continued to unfold in the shadows of the Covid pandemic.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834281"&gt;JAMA Health Forum&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers calculated the rate of deaths per year for the US and that in 21 other developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These were: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These figures were compared, and analysis was carried out to reveal how many extra deaths the US was recording per year compared to the average for other developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, researchers used data from&lt;span&gt; the Human Mortality Database, the world's leading scientific data resource on mortality in developed countries covering the years 1980 to 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis included 107million deaths in the US and 230million deaths recorded in the 21 other countries between 1980 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the excess number of deaths being recorded in the US every year compared to that in similar nations.

But while the pandemic has officially ended, the elevated death toll has persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers blame the ongoing crisis on a combination of drug overdoses, gun violence, traffic accidents, and chronic diseases like heart failure and diabetes, all of which are hitting the US harder than other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also cited the lack of a robust social safety net — common in many European countries — as a major factor worsening the toll. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers said the uptick was linked to surging overdose deaths from drugs among other factors.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found mechanical dishwashing of plastic plates, bowls, cups and cutlery leads to the release of micro- and nano-sized particles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'Even routine household activities, like dishwashing, can have significant environmental consequences,' Dr Elvis Okoffo from the University of Queensland said in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2025/05/dishwashing-containers-source-of-microplastic-pollution"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We demonstrated that plastic containers and utensils washed in dishwashers release plastic particles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2025, the US has seen an estimated 7.2 million people aged 65 and older &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5527593/5-7-million-people-Alzheimers-costing-277-BILLION-year.html"&gt;living with Alzheimer's dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this number is projected to rise to nine million by 2030 and nearly 12 million by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While microplastics have not been definitely linked to the cognitive issue, a recent study of 54 brain samples found that dementia patients had significantly higher concentrations of microplastics than those without dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences, Albuquerque found levels were up to 10 times higher in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the new study, researchers collected 13 different plastic items and simulated typical dishwasher cycles to assess how much plastic is shed into the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now only do the particles contaminate other dishes, but they are released into wastewater that flows into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics are plastic fragments less than five millimeters in size, while nanoplastics are even smaller, less than 100 nanometers - less than the size of a human hair. Both are linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease, cognitive issues and reproductive problems .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 2025, the US has seen an estimated 7.2 million people aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer's dementia.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depression and anxiety can spread between married couples through shared mouth bacteria — healthy spouses showed increased mental health symptoms after just six months of marriage to a depressed partner.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Women appear more susceptible to this bacterial transmission — female spouses experienced more pronounced changes in both their oral microbiome and mental health scores.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This research could change how we treat mental health in relationships — healthcare providers may need to consider treating both partners as a unit rather than focusing on individuals alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEHRAN —&lt;/strong&gt; Marriage means sharing your life with someone special. But new research out of Iran reveals couples might be sharing more than they bargained for: the bacteria in their mouths — and potentially their mental health struggles along with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study of newlywed couples in Iran found that when one spouse suffers from depression and anxiety, their partner’s oral bacteria actually changes to mirror theirs. As those microbes shift, so do the healthy partner’s mood and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After just six months of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt;, previously healthy spouses showed significantly higher rates of depression, anxiety, and sleep problems if their partner had what researchers called the “depression-anxiety phenotype” — essentially, someone dealing with both conditions simultaneously along with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Oral microbiota transmission between individuals in close contact partially mediates symptoms of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;,” the researchers concluded in their paper published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xiahepublishing.com/2472-0712/ERHM-2025-00013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The journal notes that exploratory research published by it “does not necessarily need to be comprehensive and conclusive, but the study design must be solid, the methodologies must be reliable, the results must be true, and the hypothesis must be rational and justifiable with evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-bacteria-jump-between-partners"&gt;How Bacteria Jump Between Partners&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every time you &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/kissing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;kiss your spouse&lt;/a&gt;, share a meal, or breathe the same air in close quarters, you’re potentially swapping millions of bacteria. Most bacterial exchange is harmless or even beneficial. But this study points to a pathway for mental health conditions to spread between intimate partners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by independent researcher Reza Rastmanesh, tracked couples married for an average of six months. They recruited 1,740 couples from two private sleep clinics in Tehran between February and October 2024, comparing 268 healthy spouses with 268 partners who had depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. Both groups took standardized mental health tests, provided saliva samples to measure stress hormones, and had their mouth bacteria analyzed using advanced DNA sequencing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the study’s start, healthy spouses scored normally on tests for depression, anxiety, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. After six months of living with an affected partner, their scores climbed significantly higher — not quite matching their troubled spouse, but moving in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Can depression or anxiety really be transmitted through a kiss? New research suggests the swapping of oral bacteria could make it possible (Photo by PeopleImages.com – Yuri A on Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More revealing was what happened to their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/oral-health-heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mouth bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. The oral microbiome—the community of microorganisms living in our mouths—of healthy spouses began resembling that of their depressed and anxious partners. Using a technique called linear discriminant analysis, researchers found that specific bacterial families like &lt;em&gt;Clostridia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Veillonella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/em&gt; became more abundant in both partners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These bacteria aren’t random. Previous research has linked these same microorganisms to brain disorders, including depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Scientists believe these bacteria may affect the brain by compromising the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-brain-barrier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; or through what’s called the “oral microbiota-brain axis”—essentially, a pathway of communication between mouth bacteria and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-women-show-stronger-effects"&gt;Women Show Stronger Effects&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Female spouses appeared more susceptible to these changes than men, showing more pronounced increases in depression, anxiety, and sleep problems after six months, along with greater shifts in their oral bacteria composition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also measured &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cortisol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, often called the “stress hormone,” in participants’ saliva. Healthy spouses married to depressed and anxious partners showed significant increases in their cortisol levels over six months, indicating their stress response systems were being activated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This bacterial transmission theory builds on existing research showing how couples synchronize biologically — their heart rates can align during conversations, sleep patterns often mirror each other, and they share similar daily cortisol rhythms. What’s new here is the suggestion that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; conditions might spread through bacterial exchange.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-treatment"&gt;What This Means for Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings could reshape how we think about treating depression and anxiety in relationships. Instead of focusing solely on the individual patient, healthcare providers might need to consider the couple as a unit, potentially treating both partners even when only one shows obvious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research builds on compelling evidence from animal studies where scientists successfully transferred depression-like behaviors to healthy mice by transplanting gut bacteria from depressed animals. Other studies show that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/probiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;—beneficial bacteria—can improve mood and reduce anxiety in both animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, this study has limitations. Researchers only followed couples for six months and didn’t account for other factors like shared stress from major life events, similar diets, or lifestyle changes that come with marriage. Participants were also aware they were being studied, which could have influenced their responses to mental health questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted in Iran with Persian-speaking couples, so findings might not apply universally. While the study found strong correlations between bacterial changes and mental health symptoms, it can’t definitively prove the bacteria caused the mood changes—just that they occurred together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For couples, the findings offer both concern and hope. While no one wants to think they might “catch” their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/hugs-help-ease-pain-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;partner’s depression&lt;/a&gt;, understanding this potential mechanism could lead to better treatments. If bacterial imbalances contribute to mental health problems, then targeted probiotics or other microbiome interventions might offer new therapeutic options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research also reinforces what marriage counselors and therapists have long observed—that mental health conditions affect entire families, not just individuals. This study provides biological evidence for that clinical experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/relationship-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;close relationships&lt;/a&gt;, couples may share more than they realize—including microscopic influences on their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a cross-sectional study of 536 Iranian couples (268 couples total) who had been married for an average of six months. They recruited participants from two private sleep clinics in Tehran between February and October 2024. One spouse in each couple had what researchers called the “depression-anxiety phenotype”—meaning they scored high on standardized tests for depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II score of 14 or higher), anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory score of 16-25), and sleep problems (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index indicating poor sleep). The other spouse was healthy at the study’s start. Participants completed mental health questionnaires, provided saliva samples for cortisol measurement, and had oral bacteria collected from their tonsils and throat. The bacterial samples were analyzed using advanced DNA sequencing techniques to identify and quantify different bacterial species.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After six months, healthy spouses showed significant increases in depression, anxiety, and sleep problem scores compared to their baseline measurements, though they remained lower than their affected partners’ scores. Their oral bacteria composition changed to become more similar to their depressed and anxious spouses, with specific bacterial families (Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae) becoming more abundant. Salivary cortisol levels also increased significantly in the healthy spouses. Female spouses showed more pronounced changes than male spouses across all measures. The researchers found that oral bacteria patterns could predict depression-anxiety status and that bacterial changes correlated with mood and stress hormone alterations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study followed couples for only six months, which may not capture long-term effects. Participants knew they were being studied, potentially influencing their questionnaire responses. The research didn’t control for confounding factors like shared diet, stress exposure, or frequency of intimacy between couples. The study used self-report questionnaires rather than clinical psychiatric diagnoses. Only morning saliva samples were collected for cortisol measurement, and bacterial sampling was limited to tonsils and throat due to budget constraints. The sample consisted entirely of Persian-speaking Iranian couples, limiting generalizability to other populations.&lt;/p&gt;

This new approach enables side-by-side testing of grafts—one with retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and one without—within the same lesion, using a specially designed clamp to maintain eye pressure and reduce damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animal models, the RPE grafts significantly preserved light-sensing photoreceptors and regenerated the choriocapillaris, the blood vessel layer essential for retinal health. These results enhance ongoing efforts to translate lab-grown stem cell therapies into clinical treatments for vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Grafting Innovation:&lt;/strong&gt; A new technique allows simultaneous implantation of two grafts for better comparative analysis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photoreceptor Preservation:&lt;/strong&gt; Grafts containing RPE cells protected light-sensing neurons better than controls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vessel Regeneration:&lt;/strong&gt; RPE grafts uniquely regenerated the choriocapillaris, crucial for retinal support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NIH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists have developed a new surgical technique for implanting multiple tissue grafts in the eye’s retina. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings in animals may help advance treatment options for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is a leading cause of vision loss among older Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report about the technique published today in &lt;em&gt;JCI Insight&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110332"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amd-vision-surgery-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Post surgery, scientists used artificial intelligence to analyze retinal images and compare the effects of each graft.  Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In diseases such as AMD, the light-sensitive retina tissue at the back of the eye degenerates. Scientists are testing therapies for restoring damaged retinas with grafts of tissue grown in the lab from patient-derived stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, surgeons have only been able to place one graft in the retina, limiting the area that can be treated in patients, and as well as the ability to conduct side-by-side comparisons in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such comparisons are crucial for confirming that the tissue grafts are integrating with the retina and the underlying blood supply from a network of tiny blood vessels known as the choriocapillaris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the technique, investigators designed a new surgical clamp that maintains eye pressure during the insertion of two tissue patches in immediate succession while minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animal models, the scientists used their newly designed surgical technique to compare two different grafts placed sequentially in the same experimentally induced AMD-like lesion. One graft consisted of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells grown on a biodegradable scaffold. RPE cells support and nourish the retina’s light-sensing photoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In AMD, vision loss occurs alongside the loss of RPE cells and photoreceptors. In the lab, RPE cells are grown from human blood cells after they’ve been converted into stem cells. The second graft consisted of just the biodegradable scaffold to serve as a control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post surgery, scientists used artificial intelligence to analyze retinal images and compare the effects of each graft. They observed that the RPE grafts promoted the survival of photoreceptors, while photoreceptors near scaffold-only grafts died at a much higher rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they were able to confirm for the first time that the RPE graft also regenerated the choriocapillaris, which supplies the retina with oxygen and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings expand on the capability demonstrated in an ongoing, NIH-led first-in-human clinical trial of patient-derived RPE grafts for the dry form of AMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was supported by the National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AMD and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9dd3d4d5cdeff8eeeeddf3f4f5b3faf2eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIH Office of Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;NIH Office of Communications – NIH&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.179246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;iPSC-RPE patch preserves photoreceptors and regenerates choriocapillaris in a pig outer regina degeneration model&lt;/a&gt;” by Kapil Bharti et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;JCI Insight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPSC-RPE patch preserves photoreceptors and regenerates choriocapillaris in a pig outer regina degeneration model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of untreatable vision loss. In advanced cases, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell loss occurs alongside photoreceptor and choriocapillaris degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that an RPE-patch would mitigate photoreceptor and choriocapillaris degeneration to restore vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An induced pluripotent stem cell–derived RPE (iRPE) patch was developed using a clinically compatible manufacturing process by maturing iRPE cells on a biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare outcomes, we developed a surgical procedure for immediate sequential delivery of PLGA-iRPE and/or PLGA-only patches in the subretinal space of a pig model of laser-induced outer retinal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep learning algorithm-based optical coherence tomography (OCT) image segmentation verified preservation of the photoreceptors over the areas of PLGA-iRPE–transplanted retina and not in laser-injured or PLGA-only–transplanted retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptive optics imaging of individual cone photoreceptors further supported this finding.

                                &lt;p&gt;DELMARVA - Whether you're heading in for surgery or rushing a family member to the emergency room, the hospital you choose can affect more than your insurance bill; it can shape how safely you leave. Twice a year, a national nonprofit tries to answer a crucial question: How safe are the hospitals you rely on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spring 2025 Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade report shows where Delmarva's hospitals excel at preventing harm and where room remains to improve. Behind each letter, however, is a deeper story about surgical complications, infection risks, communication and how growing communities are shaping the quality of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five Delmarva hospitals received A's, one received a B and three received C's when it comes to safety, according to Leapfrog's spring 2025 report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an improvement from fall 2023, when &lt;a href="https://www.coasttv.com/news/hospital-safety-concerns-no-delaware-facilities-receive-as-in-recent-assessment/article_b8e31004-7f44-11ee-882e-77870f0b1bca.html" target="_blank"&gt;no Delaware hospital received an A&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, TidalHealth Peninsula Regional in Salisbury was the only hospital on Delmarva with an A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leapfrog's twice-yearly scorecard aggregates more than 30 measures of infections, safety, preventative practices, surgical outcomes, staffing and communication to rate hospitals across the country from A to F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scroll to the end of this article for a hospital-by-hospital breakdown of scores and what they mean for patients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five of the nine hospitals that serve Delaware and the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland— TidalHealth Peninsula Regional, TidalHealth Nanticoke, Atlantic General and ChristianaCare's Christiana and Wilmington hospitals— earned A's in the spring 2025 Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade. The University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton received a B. Bayhealth's Kent and Sussex campuses, along with Beebe, received C's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-blur"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-48ca4d93-e1f3-4f25-add5-b4e99d0328f4" data-instance="#gallery-items-f2af2c81-1e51-470d-be41-8f219441dbde-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-f2af2c81-1e51-470d-be41-8f219441dbde"&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;HOW SCORES ARE DETERMINED&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.leapfroggroup.org/about" target="_blank"&gt;The Leapfrog Group&lt;/a&gt;, a Washington-based national nonprofit that collects, analyzes and publishes data on healthcare safety and quality, conducts programs like the safety grade, which evaluates nearly 3,000 hospitals nationwide on how well they keep patients safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These safety grades, issued every spring and fall, are determined by using performance measures from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, surveys submitted by hospitals and supplemental data sources. Measures are then weighted based on evidence, opportunity for improvement and impact. Hospitals missing too many measures do not receive a safety grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spring 2025 grades reflect data from between 2021 and 2024, depending on the category. &lt;a href="https://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/your-hospitals-safety-grade/about-the-grade" target="_blank"&gt;Because of Leapfrog's scoring methodology&lt;/a&gt;, Hospitals missing too much data aren't graded. For those that are, each measure is weighted based on its impact on patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chart below is comprised of data for different measures that are &lt;a href="https://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/your-hospitals-safety-grade" target="_blank"&gt;compiled by the Leapfrog Group&lt;/a&gt; to determine a hospital's letter grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;HOW LOCAL HOSPITALS COMPARE NATIONALLY&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges of serving largely rural areas and growing coastal populations, Delmarva's hospitals performed well on several key national safety standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, these nine facilities have physicians with advanced training in intensive or critical care working in their ICUs, which even some larger urban hospitals did not. Six local hospitals met Leapfrog's standard for electronic prescribing, a practice that helps prevent errors. Three others saw considerable achievement in this area, according to the Leapfrog data. All of Delmarva's hospitals reported zero cases of "never events" like air embolisms, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These wins suggest that, despite smaller labor pools, core systems to prevent many potentially catastrophic errors have been implemented. Yet, these same hospitals sometimes stumble on equally critical metrics that hinge on day-to-day bedside care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals &lt;a href="https://www.coasttv.com/news/beebe-healthcare-faces-growing-strain-as-sussex-county-expands/article_74164ebe-a9b7-4548-999d-2a55ac9e35b1.html" target="_blank"&gt;serving southern Delaware's explosive growth&lt;/a&gt; like Beebe, Bayhealth Sussex and Bayhealth Kent reported bed sore rates worse than the U.S. average. Bayhealth Kent ranked among the nation's poorest performers in patient fall fractures and collapsed lungs after procedures. Even the area's only straight-A hospital, TidalHealth Peninsula Regional, reported a surgical complication death rate closer to the nation's poorest performers than to its best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenges aside, there are some bright spots. For the first time, Leapfrog is recognizing &lt;a href="https://www.leapfroggroup.org/news-events/leapfrog%E2%80%99s-spring-2025-safety-grades-are-%E2%80%94-new-trend-data-shows-one-eight-hospitals" target="_blank"&gt;straight-A hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, or those that have earned an A for five or more consecutive reporting periods. TidalHealth Peninsula Regional is the only hospital on Delmarva to achieve this status, joining just 12 percent of eligible hospitals nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mid-Atlantic neighbor New Jersey is one of the top five states in the country with the highest share of straight-A hospitals, with 27 percent of its eligible facilities receiving this status. It is also one of six states with the highest percentage of A grades this spring. Though an influx of out-of-state license plates shows that New Jerseyans love moving to Delaware, it may not be for healthcare. The first state is, by contrast, one of 12 states (plus Washington, D.C.) with no straight-A hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looked at together, the data paint a nuanced picture; Delmarva's hospitals can meet or exceed high-standard structural requirements, but patient care issues still appear in bedside-level harms that technology and checklists alone can't yet erase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY THIS SPRING&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among all of the measures Leapfrog evaluates, one in particular stands out as a potential regional red flag: deaths from serious, treatable complications after surgery. Four Delmarva hospitals scored worse than the national average in this category. Two others were slightly above average. The remaining three did not receive a score in this category, meaning they did not have enough data to report for this measure, not that they withheld information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TidalHealth Peninsula Regional had the lowest available local score despite its straight-A status. ChristianaCare's Christiana and Wilmington hospitals reported the best numbers for Delmarva in this spring's report and were the only ones on the peninsula slightly above the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-blur"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-07aed8cb-909b-44f9-8ece-9ce3b2e254cb" data-instance="#gallery-items-f2af2c81-1e51-470d-be41-8f219441dbde-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-f2af2c81-1e51-470d-be41-8f219441dbde"&gt;
                &lt;span class="fas tnt-expand"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;

                                &lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;After surgery, patients can sometimes develop serious complications while still in the hospital, such as pneumonia, have a heart attack or lose function in their kidneys or liver. These numbers represent the number of surgical patients who died for every 1,000 people who had a serious treatable complication after surgery, according to Leapfrog. &lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/span&gt;
                            
                        
                            
                        
                        &lt;span class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to infections, most hospitals in Delaware and on the Eastern Shore of Maryland performed better than expected when it came to infections like C. diff and MRSA, two potentially dangerous bacteria commonly spread in healthcare settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. diff can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever, often after antibiotic use. The University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton scored very well when it came to C. diff, while it performed worse than expected for MRSA, which is a type of staph infection that resists many antibiotics and can be spread through contaminated equipment or unwashed hands. Preventing these infections comes down to hygiene, from handwashing to proper equipment sterilization, and the data suggests most local facilities are doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-blur"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-6cf6625e-4dc3-4b9e-9476-132b47c90b05" data-instance="#gallery-items-f2af2c81-1e51-470d-be41-8f219441dbde-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-f2af2c81-1e51-470d-be41-8f219441dbde"&gt;
                &lt;span class="fas tnt-expand"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;

                                &lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;
                                    &lt;p&gt;The plotted numbers represent comparisons made during Leapfrog's scoring process when it comes to infections. The comparison looks at the number of infections that actually happened at a hospital compared to the number expected for it, given the number of patients cared for on a daily basis and how widespread these bacteria are in the local community. A number lower than one means fewer infections occurred than were expected, while a number greater than one means more infections than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;HOSPITAL-BY-HOSPITAL&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letter grades can offer a quick snapshot, but they don't tell the full story. Each grade is a weighted blend of more than 30 performance measures. Some measures scores are drawn from fresh data, while others are from years ago; some reflect hospital-reported surveys, others come from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means a hospital can excel in one area, like infection control, but fall short in another, like preventing surgical complications.

&lt;div class="summary-box"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TidalHealth – A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TidalHealth, including both the Peninsula Regional facility in Salisbury and the Nanticoke facility in Seaford, received A's through the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade this spring. The Nanticoke facility maintained the A rating it achieved in the fall, which was preceded by a B in spring 2024 and C's in 2023 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Achieving an A grade for a second consecutive period reflects the deep commitment of our entire team in Seaford to uphold the highest standards in clinical excellence, safety practices and compassionate care," said Penny Short, president of TidalHealth Nanticoke. "We're proud to serve our community with the safest and most reliable healthcare in downstate Delaware."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peninsula Regional has maintained A's straight back through 2023, with B's in 2022. That being said, even as the only straight A hospital on Delmarva, it had the worst score for the measure which looked at patient death from serious treatable complications when compared to others locally. Complications in this measure include pneumonia, heart attack or losing function in an organ. Leapfrog says these types of complications are serious but can be treated by a good hospital team. It is worth noting, as mentioned above, that three of the nine Delmarva hospitals included in this article did not report scores for this measure, and of those that did, they remained below or around average when compared nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TidalHealth Peninsula Regional and TidalHealth Nanticoke scored below average when it came to patient falls; however, when looking directly at the data and not just comparisons to other hospitals, the picture may change. In this case, below-average means that, at TidalHealth Nanticoke, which received the worst score between the two, less than one person out of 1,000 patients who were eventually discharged experienced a fall or similar trauma, according to Leapfrog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanticoke's communication with doctors, nurses and staff received high marks from patients. Scores for this measure represent a zero-to-100 scale based on patients' perspectives of how effectively doctors and nurses explained things and listened to them. Nanticoke also scored well for the speed of response of hospital staff when patients request help for pain, new symptoms or cannot reach the bathroom alone. Nanticoke received the highest scores for nurse communication and hospital staff response on the Peninsula, with a 93 and 85, respectively. In these three staff-patient communication categories, Nanticoke was joined by Atlantic General in receiving above-average scores; in fact, Atlantic General had the highest peninsula score for doctor communication with a 93.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an overall hospital, Atlantic General also received an A alongside the two TidalHealth facilities, a good sign given the &lt;a href="https://www.coasttv.com/news/joining-forces-atlantic-general-hospital-now-under-the-tidalhealth-umbrella/article_1236b8b6-a14a-4c28-9a44-a7a05bb73a9c.html" target="_blank"&gt;new partnership between these healthcare systems that began May 1&lt;/a&gt;, which brings Atlantic General under the TidalHealth umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Safety is foremost for all healthcare providers. Our team at Atlantic General Hospital worked extremely hard over the past year to improve to an A, which is an outstanding achievement in support of their patient safety mission," said Steve Leonard, president and CEO of TidalHealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its doctor communication score, Atlantic General also had the best score on Delmarva when it came to communication about discharge, but the worst score for C. diff infections. According to the Leapfrog safety grade results, Atlantic General received a 1.23 for C. diff infection. This number represents a comparison of the number of infections that actually happened to the number expected for this hospital based on its number of patients and how widespread C. diff is in the local community. A number higher than one means more infections than expected, according to Leapfrog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="panel-deets" id="bay"&gt;
&lt;div class="summary-box"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayhealth – C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayhealth's Kent and Sussex facilities have had different trends in recent years. While the Kent campus has received a C for the past six Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grades dating back through spring 2022, the Sussex campus has shown a downward trend. In 2022, the Sussex campus received an A in both the spring and fall. In 2023 and spring of 2024, the hospital received B's. Starting in the fall of 2024, Bayhealth Hospital's Sussex campus received a C, which it got again this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At Bayhealth, we are deeply committed to delivering exceptional care and the best possible experience for all the patients we serve across our facilities," Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Kyle Benoit tells CoastTV. "We are disappointed that our recent Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grades of C this year do not fully reflect the outstanding dedication and high-quality care our clinicians provide daily."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at specific measures, the Sussex Bayhealth campus had the worst score of Delmarva's hospitals for surgical site infection after colon surgery. This score, a 2.124, is below the national average and represents the number of infections after colon surgery that actually happened compared to the expected number for this hospital. Numbers above one mean more infections occurred than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Kent campus in Dover, scores were not good for patient falls. In particular, this facility's Leapfrog score was equal to the worst score received by all hospitals across the nation for collapsed lungs, at 0.65 for every 1,000 people, and falls that cause broken hips, at 0.56 per 1,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to sepsis, Bayhealth Kent was also a bit below the national average and the lowest scoring on Delmarva. According to the spring 2025 Leapfrog safety grade, 5.63 surgical patients per 1,000 experience sepsis across the country. At Bayhealth, that number is 6.69 patients per 1,000, followed next by Bayhealth Sussex at 5.29, which is actually slightly better than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these reports from post-surgery care, the Bayhealth Kent campus received above-average scores when compared to hospitals across the nation for not having problems with surgery, including surgical wounds splitting open, blood leakage, kidney injuries and accidental cuts and tears. Both Bayhealth facilities also received top marks for effective leadership structures that increase awareness of patient safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These scores are not where we aim to be, and we have multiple teams actively developing detailed action plans to enhance our quality metrics and address areas needing improvement," Benoit said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="panel-deets" id="beebe"&gt;
&lt;div class="summary-box"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beebe – C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beebe has generally remained steady, receiving C's in five out of the last six Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade reports, including this spring. Beebe received a D in spring 2024. Beebe's last A was given in the spring of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked for comment, Beebe Healthcare President and CEO Dr. David Tam told CoastTV that, while Beebe recognizes the value of independent surveys and takes every opportunity for improvement seriously, the organization does not feel the recent Leapfrog score reflects the quality of care that Beebe clinicians and staff members provide to patients and the community each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tam also pointed out that this spring's scores rely on historical data, not the most recent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Beebe consistently meets or exceeds several other quality and safety standards, as is reflected in our ranking as the &lt;a href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/de" target="_blank"&gt;number two hospital in Delaware, according to U.S. News and World Report&lt;/a&gt;," Tam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Delmarva, Beebe scored worst for kidney injuries after surgery and harmful events. Beebe received a 2.12 in the spring 2025 Leapfrog safety score, a number that represents the estimated number of times patients experienced kidney failure after major surgery for every 1,000 people who had surgery. It's worth noting that patients who are older or have other pre-existing health problems are at a greater risk of experiencing kidney failure, and Beebe is in the heart of coastal Sussex County, which has seen an influx of retirees in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Beebe scored by far the worst when compared to other local hospitals when it came to bed sores. The hospital's score of 7.16 patients with dangerous bed sores for every 1,000 people discharged was closer to the national worst of 7.5 than it was to the next closest Delmarva facility, which was the Bayhealth Sussex campus with a score of 1.83. Bed sores are wounds on the skin that form when a patient remains in the same position for too long without being moved. Advanced bed sores can become large and deep, potentially reaching muscle or bone and leading to pain or serious infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, Beebe reported improvements in areas such as handwashing, receiving a 100 this spring compared to a 40 in the fall of 2023, and beating the national average number of patients that experienced a sepsis infection, which was also below average a year-and-a-half ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Beebe received a positive score for central line-associated blood infections. Scores in this category represent a comparison of the number of blood infections that actually happened at Beebe compared to the number expected there based on the number of central lines used and other factors like facility type and size. According to Leapfrog, Beebe had fewer infections that would have been expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Beebe spokesperson shared with CoastTV that the hospital celebrated several quality and safety achievements in 2024 and continued success into this year, including zero central line-associated bloodstream infections and four years in a row without one of these types of infections in the ICU. The hospital also achieved more than a 50 percent reduction in patient falls through its fall prevention task force, according to Beebe, which evaluates the causes of patient falls and identifies opportunities to improve in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beebe also received positive Leapfrog scores from patients when it came to communicating information about home care and the help they would need during recovery, including written information about symptoms or issues to watch for during recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Quality and safety efforts are never complete for any health system. Day after day at Beebe, we evaluate and apply evidence-based improvement methods to identify, define, measure, analyze and improve processes, systems and structures to achieve the highest standards for patient safety and secure the best patient outcomes," Tam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="panel-deets" id="christ"&gt;
&lt;div class="summary-box"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChristianaCare – A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChristianaCare's Christiana and Wilmington hospitals have been on the upswing in recent years when looking at their Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade reports. The Christiana hospital received an A this spring, the highest score received in recent years. ChristianaCare's Christiana hospital received B's in 2024 and C's in 2023. This spring, the Wilmington hospital maintained its A rating from the fall, which was an improvement from a B in spring 2024 and a C's in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wilmington hospital's MRSA infection score was the best on the peninsula, determined by Leapfrog as being better than expected for a facility like it. In fact, this hospital was the only one on Delmarva that reported above-average scores when compared nationally in all measures related to infection, including for C. diff infections, infections in the blood or urinary tract, surgical site infections after colon surgery and sepsis after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Wilmington and Christiana facilities are slightly above average when it comes to deaths from serious treatable complications after surgery and had the best scores on Delmarva with both reporting 170.41 surgical patient deaths for every 1,000 people who had a serious treatable complication after surgery, down from the 177.45 national average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both ChristianaCare hospitals also had above average scores in a variety of safety categories like avoiding falls, collapsed lungs, dangerous blood clots and potentially harmful events after a surgery, procedure or childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="panel-deets" id="um"&gt;
&lt;div class="summary-box"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UM Shore Medical Center – B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shore Medical Center in Easton has remained generally consistent over the past three years in the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade. It received a B this spring, the same score received in 2024. Before that, it received A's in 2023 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spring, the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center did worse than a hospital like it was expected to when it comes to MRSA infections, receiving a below-average score nationally and the worst score on Delmarva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it had the best Delmarva score of 5.3 per 1,000 surgical patients who experienced serious breathing problems. This score was well below the national average of 10.53, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Scientists found that deleting this four–amino acid segment from a synapse-building protein, PTPδ, disrupted neural activity and led to anxiety-like behaviors in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mini-exon enables PTPδ to bind with another protein, IL1RAP, forming a complex critical for excitatory synapse development. This discovery helps explain how subtle changes in genetic splicing may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, ADHD, and OCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mini-Exon B Function:&lt;/strong&gt; A 4–amino acid segment in PTPδ enables essential synaptic protein interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Imbalance:&lt;/strong&gt; Removing mini-exon B caused reduced survival, synaptic dysfunction, and anxiety-like behaviors in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The disrupted signaling pathway mirrors patterns seen in autism, ADHD, and OCD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) have identified a remarkably small but critical piece of genetic code that helps determine how brain cells connect, communicate, and function. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery not only deepens our understanding of how the brain’s wiring is built but may also explain the origins of several neurological and psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110324"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce.jpg" alt="This shows genes and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-behavior-brain-neuroscincce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The findings are especially relevant given the growing evidence that disruptions in microexon splicing may underlie several neuropsychiatric conditions. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted by the Center for Synaptic Brain Dysfunctions at IBS and led by Director KIM Eunjoon (Distinguished Professor at KAIST), focuses on a protein called PTPδ—a key molecule that helps neurons form synapses, the connections that allow brain cells to pass signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While PTPδ has already been linked to disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, OCD, and restless leg syndrome, the researchers have now zoomed in on a previously unstudied detail: a tiny segment known as mini-exon B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mini-exon is created through a process called alternative splicing, in which cells include or exclude specific snippets of genetic material to slightly alter the structure—and function—of a protein. Mini-exon B is just four amino acids long, yet the team found it plays a surprisingly powerful role in brain development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Closer Look at the Brain’s Synaptic “Glue”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;he brain’s ability to think, feel, and move depends on a delicate balance of electrical and chemical signals. These signals travel across synapses, where one neuron passes a message to the next. Proteins like PTPδ help these synapses form properly by acting like molecular Velcro—linking neurons together with precise alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers genetically engineered mice to delete mini-exon B from the PTPδ gene. The results were dramatic: Mice missing mini-exon B entirely had a survival rate of less than 30% after birth, highlighting its essential role in early brain development and viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, mice with one copy of the gene altered survived into adulthood but displayed clear behavioral changes, including anxiety-like behavior and reduced movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain recordings in these mice also showed a misbalance in synaptic activity. Granule cells—neurons responsible for processing information—received weaker excitatory input, while interneurons, which help keep brain activity in check, received stronger excitatory signals. This excitation-inhibition imbalance is a hallmark feature of various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular Clues: A Lock-and-Key Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To uncover how this tiny segment affects brain signaling, the researchers examined the proteins interacting with PTPδ. They discovered that PTPδ forms a molecular complex with another protein called IL1RAP—but only when mini-exon B is present. Without this mini-exon, PTPδ loses its ability to engage IL1RAP, disrupting a critical pathway for forming excitatory synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interaction turned out to be cell-type specific, meaning it behaves differently depending on which neurons are involved. This level of specificity explains why the deletion of mini-exon B affects some parts of the brain more than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director KIM Eunjoon remarked, “This study illustrates how even the tiniest genetic element can tip the balance of neural circuits. It’s a compelling reminder that errors in alternative splicing could have profound consequences in brain disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Human Brain Disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first in vivo study to demonstrate the function of PTPδ’s mini-exon B. The findings are especially relevant given the growing evidence that disruptions in microexon splicing may underlie several neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditions like autism and ADHD have been increasingly linked to impaired synaptic development, and this study helps explain one mechanism by which that might happen. It also highlights the need to study not just genes themselves but the tiny variations in how they’re assembled by the cell’s machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, these insights could inform the development of therapies that target splicing regulation or help restore normal synaptic balance in affected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted in collaboration with KAIST, KBSI, KISTI, Kyungpook National University, and Yonsei University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eunjoon Kim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eunjoon Kim – Institute for Basic Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59685-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alternatively spliced mini-exon B in PTPδ regulates excitatory synapses through cell-type-specific trans-synaptic PTPδ-IL1RAP interaction&lt;/a&gt;” by Seoyeong Kim et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternatively spliced mini-exon B in PTPδ regulates excitatory synapses through cell-type-specific trans-synaptic PTPδ-IL1RAP interaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTPδ, encoded by &lt;em&gt;PTPRD&lt;/em&gt;, is implicated in various neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTPδ trans-synaptically interacts with multiple postsynaptic adhesion molecules, which involves its extracellular alternatively spliced mini-exons, meA and meB. While PTPδ-meA functions have been studied in vivo, PTPδ-meB has not been studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that, unlike homozygous PTPδ-meA-mutant mice, homozygous PTPδ-meB-mutant (&lt;em&gt;Ptprd-meB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;–/–&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) mice show markedly reduced early postnatal survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heterozygous &lt;em&gt;Ptprd-meB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;+/–&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; male mice show behavioral abnormalities and decreased excitatory synaptic density and transmission in dentate gyrus granule cells (DG-GCs). Proteomic analyses identify decreased postsynaptic density levels of IL1RAP, a known trans-synaptic partner of meB-containing PTPδ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, IL1RAP-mutant mice show decreased excitatory synaptic transmission in DG-GCs. &lt;em&gt;Ptprd-meB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;+/–&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; DG interneurons with minimal IL1RAP expression show increased excitatory synaptic density and transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, PTPδ-meB is important for survival, synaptic, and behavioral phenotypes and regulates excitatory synapses in cell-type-specific and IL1RAP-dependent manners.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 14:16:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5xSmlGR0V6ZHd4QXpGNnVDSS1QRnZjRlMwX1kwUXJJTjB1NHFZOEJQcHdnRjJQUnFVMDZ5amFhWndTdVFhNUF5anBKRHFZR29aS1dLcGhWLVdsQWs2UWs0Zk53Zk0ydDRidUtyYl92UQ</guid></item><item><title>开发的血液测试可以加快婴儿罕见疾病的诊断-卫报 | Blood test developed that could speed up diagnosis of rare diseases in babies - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQUHF1SVdKZWc1NHZjRjdpWmhXTVpqRXdSbk41T2VQclh5RXpoX091c0ZwN0JDbnBoVEt2Z2dSN0w0bHFFRlJSZy1oM1ZOTEViRndZUW85VVpQeFhUOXdISXI3SGZDOTZMNHVDZkgzTW5kUER0S2JYM1I5akZhQ0xLZm1nRk1iREJPM1lqajdSaW1hQ3EtSjlKWFpUQUlJME44Ri1J?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A new blood-based test that could help speed up diagnoses for children born with rare genetic disorders has been developed by researchers in an effort to provide answers – and treatments – sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rare genetic disorders include a host of conditions, from cystic fibrosis to diseases relating to the mitochondria – the powerhouses of our cells.

We think a single proteomic test can increase that diagnostic yield to 50-70% of suspected patients,” said Prof David Thorburn, another author of the research from the University of Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the study focuses on using the test for mitochondrial diseases, Stroud said it was already applicable to about half of the 7,000 known rare diseases, although more work was needed to demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Stroud added that for mitochondrial diseases as little as 1ml of blood from a newborn was required for the procedure, whereas current techniques involved a muscle biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Furthermore, while a mitochondria-focused version of the test has a similar cost to current techniques, it is not specific to one kind of rare disease. That not only makes it more cost-effective but, as Stroud noted, it also means patients could avoid having to take other unnecessary tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This has obvious benefits to both the patient and healthcare system,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A diagnosis not only sheds light on the disease, and – in some cases – possible treatments. It also helps parents who are considering having further children by raising the possibility of pre-natal genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Michal Minczuk, a professor of mitochondrial genetics, at the&lt;br&gt;
 University of Cambridge, and who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research. “Overall, the paper marks a very significant step forward in diagnostic practices by introducing a robust, rapid, and minimally invasive method for confirming and characterising genetic disorders,” he said. “This could greatly enhance patient care by expanding the tools available for clinicians and researchers in genomic medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Robert Pitceathly, a professor of clinical neurology and mitochondrial medicine at UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, agreed. “The next step is broader validation and integrating this technology into NHS diagnostic services to improve patient outcomes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 14:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQUHF1SVdKZWc1NHZjRjdpWmhXTVpqRXdSbk41T2VQclh5RXpoX091c0ZwN0JDbnBoVEt2Z2dSN0w0bHFFRlJSZy1oM1ZOTEViRndZUW85VVpQeFhUOXdISXI3SGZDOTZMNHVDZkgzTW5kUER0S2JYM1I5akZhQ0xLZm1nRk1iREJPM1lqajdSaW1hQ3EtSjlKWFpUQUlJME44Ri1J</guid></item><item><title>医生透露“经常被忽视”的身体部位，您必须每天清洁，否则将面临严重的健康问题-每日邮报 | Doctor reveals 'often overlooked' body part that you MUST clean everyday, or risk serious health issue - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQdEhKSHNtZUIzOXg4TlRqS0ZsQVhpak54OXZKN0xsQWcweEg2R0gwem1sWTAxTFBMX1RLV3p5c2owOVNabTVrbEs3YV9hU2xLVEFNcEd3VVJUSUxJLXRiVTlpQXQtdjV4QkQ2aERJbTZJSWpIOEJGRXRWS19QMTFXZDlETnlhQTFhU0U2WGJMd0FuS0phWk9pU2YyZkw4eXV2Q2oyYzFmWnVNQdIBrwFBVV95cUxPWEhienhVcllxYXVLQUJzU3RjMUZDWFRpOTNLUlh2MDE4RW9nUkw2N3RoSDQxcGZkSG1tVlFCQU1lazNyM0xVY2Jkbkt2TEp1MWFVVVV6SXdseC1hS2xaLUZQSGdvN2NjUTdYaU9NXzNNdlhHTUNGZ0dIeXRxMGdFeFdZMk1nLW5rWGtvWTh1RVdSZ0Vlb3JPbnY3NWt1QVY0NTh2b3BXZkVzTG4zYmtN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

And while many migraine sufferers find relief by working with a physician to identify what may be causing their condition, narrowing down the exact cause isn’t always an easy process. Ask five people what triggers their migraines, and you’ll probably get five different answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people get quick and easy answers – finding that things like avoiding chocolate or keeping hydrated can help. Others have a more difficult journey to identifying their triggers, especially if they are lesser known. We talked to real life migraine sufferers and experts who treat them to hear about 8 things you may not know that can cause migraine to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scented garbage bags&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some migraine sufferers, certain scents can bring on a migraine attack. A common trigger is perfume, with some studies showing that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15546266/#:~:text=Conclusions:%20Osmophobia%20and%20taste%20abnormality,in%20females%20than%20in%20males." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:odors like perfume;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;odors like perfume&lt;/a&gt; can trigger migraines in 50% of people who get them. You can take proactive measures like avoiding using scented lotions and body washes but sometimes smells can sneak up on you. For Christina Sees, a 40-year-old resident of New Jersey, it was scented garbage bags that were an unexpected trigger for her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Typically at home we use unscented trash bags,” she shares. “We always have and I never really noticed or realized that they even sold scented ones. Then one day I accidentally bought scented ones at the store and that was the end of it.” Sees felt the effects instantly and experienced her usual dose of migraine symptoms. “In general, fragrances such as plug-in air fresheners, flowers or perfumes, will instantly get me sick,” she says. “It starts with nausea and blurry vision or clamminess first, then the headache comes on.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After realizing the bags made her head pound, she threw the whole box out. “I forgot about it for a while until it happened again,” says Sees. “I generally learn about my migraine triggers through patterns and repetition.” She also has to avoid using the trash cans at work since those trash bags are also scented. Her company, she says, is working on switching them to unscented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The sun&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image representing migraine pain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another trigger that Sees has learned to watch out for is the sun. “If I'm out in 73-degree weather or hotter with bright sunlight, I get frantic and am desperate to get out of the sun within five minutes because after 15 minutes the nausea begins and then I'm down for one to two days,” she reveals. Sees was working outdoors last week for what she thought would be a brief session, but it ended up being a warm day and she felt sick after 20 minutes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I can't go to the beach or pool,” she says. “Finding shade or wearing a hat can help extend my ability to sit outside, but not by much.” The American Migraine Foundation recommends taking the following steps to make time out in the sun more manageable for migraine sufferers: stay hydrated, seek out shade, cool yourself off with a spray bottle of water or a cold bandana around your neck, exercise in air conditioning if possible and stick to your meal and sleep routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Periods of calm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most people recognize the onset of stress as a common migraine trigger, I discovered that I get migraines with stress release,” says Desola Awofeso, a 41-year-old in Houston, Texas. “I’ve worked in high-stress roles for years and could never understand why the end of the workday or the weekend would usher in strong auras, followed immediately by severe migraines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finding an app to track her symptoms and describing them to her neurologist over time, her doctor was finally able to figure out the cause: the flood of stress being released all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraines happening at the conclusion stressful incidents is more common than people think, says Dr. Danielle Wilhour, a neurologist at UCHealth. “I often see patients experience a let-down migraine, not during a big event, but right after it’s over, when your body finally relaxes,” she says. “Intense physical exertion, such as a tough workout, hot yoga, or even sexual activity, can also spark an attack."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Awofeso’s doctor explained that her migraines were likely triggering because of the sudden drops in cortisol and adrenaline after work, she was able to put together a plan to help herself cope. “I learned that if I gradually released stress throughout the day — instead of all at once — I could reduce those sudden drops in hormone levels and potentially reduce the migraines. So, with that in mind I started taking short 'brain breaks' throughout the workday to gradually decompress. It was a small shift but has been super effective in preventing my stress-release migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Giving birth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image representing migraine pain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraines have been linked to changes in hormones, making them something that can appear in women &lt;a href="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/postpartum-headache/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:postpartum;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;postpartum&lt;/a&gt;. Statistics show that one in four of women will experience a migraine within two weeks of delivery and almost half will experience migraines within the first month of giving birth. Laura Haver, a 46-year-old in Chicago, Illinois, was one of those women whose migraines were triggered after childbirth. “I believe it was from exhaustion post emergency c-section and as a new mom,” she says. “Yet it continued on for years well past the birth of my second child.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctors could not figure out what was wrong. “I went to different doctors, neurologists, naturopaths, chiropractors and more. No one could do anything useful, and I regularly found myself in bed for days at a time,” Haver recalls. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, Haver hired a coach to assist with her writing, coaching, and speaking career, who introduced her to the healing power of energy work. “It was a game changer! It made such a big impact on my life and health, and I got trained myself to help others."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her health in mind, Haver created her own daily energy practice. “It's a unique fusion of energy clearing, meditation, mindfulness, and more,” she says. “It helps me release the stresses and pressures of everyday life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Traveling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image representing migraine pain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathryn Werner, a 43-year-old resident of Prattville, Alabama who has battled migraines for the past 30 years, has found that traveling can trigger her headaches. “My husband actually noticed it before I did, just saying that I always get a migraine during our vacations,” she says. She’s not alone. Others have found travel to be a situation that sets off a migraine. This can be for a variety of reasons that include flying at high altitudes, dehydration, stress, skipped meals, changing routines and different diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately now that she knows that travel is a trigger, Werner has found a way to make taking trips more comfortable. “I keep a really regular sleep schedule, eat my usual foods, stay well hydrated, avoid alcohol, and may even schedule a massage while we're on vacation,” she says. “It takes a little planning, and honestly, I usually still get a migraine, but it's much less intense and disruptive with those strategies.” She also has her doctor prescribe her medication when a migraine sets in. “It helps get me back to normal within a few hours, which is so much better than it was before!” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fluorescent lighting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since 2017, I have suffered from sudden, disorienting ocular migraines that blur my vision, distort my sight, and leave me exhausted. It wasn’t until I noticed a pattern—episodes following exposure to bright LED headlights, harsh fluorescent office lights, or losing focus while staring at screens—that I realized light sensitivity and overstimulation were significant triggers,” says Bernard Charles, a 34-year-old digital project manager in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctors confirmed Charles was experiencing ocular migraines, often triggered by visual and social stress coupled with neurological overstimulation. To navigate his diagnosis, he’s tried all sorts of things and eventually found ways to bring himself some relief. “I wear blue-light-filtering prescription glasses, use dark mode across devices, and reduce screen brightness,” he says. He’s also shifted his lifestyle by cutting caffeine and sugar, leaning into plant-based foods, and adopting a diet centered around reducing inflammation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“When a migraine happens, you immediately go into fear, anger, and depression,” says Charles. He finds meditating or sleeping are ways to help things calm down. “I now know that light pollution — from the television to the checkout station at the store — has also triggered my migraines, so I take extra precautions to reduce eye strain and keep my internal voice positive when exposed to these elements,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Poor oral health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image representing migraine pain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your oral health is important to help maintain your teeth and gums, but poor oral health and habits could be contributing to migraines. “The jaw joint, when under stress from misalignment or clenching, can trigger pain that radiates into the head and mimics migraine symptoms,” says Nicole Khalife, a general dentist, and a dental practice owner at&lt;a href="https://www.luxsmilesnyc.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lux Smiles NYC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Lux Smiles NYC&lt;/a&gt;. Treating these symptoms can help. “One patient’s migraines had been so persistent that they were considering more invasive procedures—until we discovered the problem stemmed from jaw tension caused by grinding at night,” says Khalife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another dental trigger that can contribute to headaches is misalignment or missing teeth. “When the bite is uneven, the muscles of the face and jaw compensate, and that extra work can trigger headaches that feel like migraines,” says Khalife. “Replacing missing teeth or correcting bite issues with simple dental adjustments can bring real relief.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even inflammation from gum disease or untreated tooth decay can be a hidden contributor. “Chronic oral infections or swelling can radiate pain into the head and neck,” adds Khalife. “Many people don’t connect the dots right away because the pain doesn’t always feel like it’s coming from the mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you’re a big gum chewer with migraines, listen up. “Excessive chewing—especially gum—can overstimulate jaw muscles and trigger headaches, especially in people prone to migraines,” says Dr. Joseph Goodman, CEO of &lt;a href="https://topbeverlyhillsdentist.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TopBeverlyHillsDentist.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TopBeverlyHillsDentist.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tech neck&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you find yourself staring down at your phone more times throughout the day than you can count? Some reports say we (gulp) look at our phones upwards of &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2023/07/19/how-to-cut-back-screen-time/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:144 times a day!;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;144 times a day!&lt;/a&gt; All that can add up to chronic neck and shoulder pain, known as &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/tech-neck-is-a-pain-in-more-than-just-the-neck/#:~:text=Tech%20neck%20is%20any%20form,the%20shoulders%20to%20slump%20forward." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tech neck;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tech neck&lt;/a&gt;. “Posture and jaw position are connected,” says Goodman. “Constant phone or screen use can lead to forward head posture, straining the neck and jaw, and potentially leading to migraines.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning signs that your tech habits could be contributing to migraine tension include headaches after long hours on the phone or computer, stiffness in the neck or upper back and jaw clenching while concentrating, adds Goodman. To reduce your risk, he recommends adjusting your screen to eye level, taking frequent stretch breaks, sitting upright in your chair versus bending forward and straining your spine. And one position you should definitely avoid when making a call? “Holding the phone between shoulder and ear,” says Goodman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/migraine-sufferers-talk-8-surprising-migraine-causes-11740086" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 13:36:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFAzWVpwb2p2M1F5bW02V20xUUE4Tmhhb3J0a0VwWkFtOFZRT2J5TGd6cHhqYTg1ek5Kd0Uxb3U2OC1NZG5STWlQd25ER3VjU0ZwZGZYTXJnLTgwM2ctLXJEUWVjQmZmQkZsVl9rMmFsWE5RSUVyMl9GTzdfRQ</guid></item><item><title>您应该始终与鸡蛋一起吃的令人惊讶的水果- AOL.com | The Surprising Fruit You Should Always Eat With Your Eggs - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE52ZVU1NXdjQlhBTjkxQVg2MXA3cFJnMnBKNmtOVkZWYzJWR285Wktyc05NVmZ2OEtybndneXRFUUJuOFR5RlJ4ZTB4d1Bza3M5MThIR0pvN2RSSU80MEFmck9HNFNQXzBoNXNtdjQzSElra1U1UXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;10 Nutritious Food Combos You Need to Be Eating&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;NataBene - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to unlocking the full health benefits of your food, sometimes one plus one equals three. This is the power of “nutrition synergy” — a concept doctors and dietitians agree everyone should know about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“To put it simply, certain food pairings work better as a duet than as a solo,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dietitianjess.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopDyM3U6XLj7slPeMKWXdxifUhtvHtBLe5D_Q8Fz-YnuV6Sb3j-" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jess DeGore, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jess DeGore, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt; “When combined, they boost the body’s ability to absorb and use specific nutrients, helping you get the maximum benefits. This helps support improved immunity, energy, digestion and beyond.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leveraging this concept is a powerful way to be more intentional about healthy meals. “People often ask which nutrient is the most important for their health, but the real key is eating a variety of whole foods,” says &lt;a href="https://www.frugalnutrition.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Caitlin Self, L.D.N., C.N.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Caitlin Self, L.D.N., C.N.S.&lt;/a&gt;, who runs the blog Frugal Nutrition. “The fun part is that there are tons of synergistic dynamic duos to incorporate into your diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, experts share the best food combinations to add to your meal planning rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spinach and Lemon Juice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A splash of lemon juice on your spinach does more than just add flavor. Vitamin C significantly enhances the absorption of iron, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11124756/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that pairing these nutrients in a meal together is more effective than eating them separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Iron is an important nutrient, especially for healthy blood. Because the iron in plant-based iron foods like spinach is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448204/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:not as bioavailable;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;not as bioavailable&lt;/a&gt; as animal-based iron foods, it needs a little boost from sources of vitamin C,” says &lt;a href="https://www.michellecaravellacoaching.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michelle Caravella, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Michelle Caravella, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.michellecaravellacoaching.com/normalizing-your-nutrition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Normalizing Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Normalizing Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. “Also, cooking your spinach increases the availability of iron.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other smart pairings include citrus fruits, cantaloupe or strawberries (which all have plenty of vitamin C) with iron-rich foods like lentils, quinoa or tofu. Using citrus marinades on meats is another great way to boost iron absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrots and Olive Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooking carrots, especially with olive oil, can make them even more nutritious, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S146685640700046X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because beta-carotene — an antioxidant found in carrots — is fat-soluble. That means your body absorbs it better when eaten with healthy fats. Your body &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:converts beta-carotene into vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;converts beta-carotene into vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, which is crucial for your vision, immune function, cell growth and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salad Greens and Olive Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrots aren’t the only veggie that benefit from a drizzle of olive oil. Fats aid your body in absorbing vitamins A, D, E and K — which makes olive oil a nourishing dressing for all kinds of salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the easiest things you can do is add an olive oil-based dressing to your next salad,” says Caravella. “There are often many fat-soluble vitamins found in a diverse salad, and the salad dressing provides the fat to assist the body in better absorbing their nutrients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are endless for this synergistic duo: You can find vitamin A in tomatoes and red bell peppers, D in mushrooms, E in nuts and seeds and K in leafy greens, broccoli and Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eggs + Berries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know there are heart-health benefits to pairing fiber with cholesterol-rich foods? “Soluble fiber transforms into a gel-like substance in the digestive system, which traps cholesterol and prevents it from entering your bloodstream,” explains Self. “In other words, the body does a better job at digesting cholesterol when fiber is there to help take out the excess. That’s why eggs, which contain cholesterol, and berries, which are rich in fiber, make a wonderful duo.” Other beneficial fiber-rich sides for your eggs include apples, pears, beans, avocado and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eggs and Raw Veggies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also get a nutrition boost from eating your eggs with raw vegetables. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5086793/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that eating 3 whole eggs with a salad increased the absorption of carotenoids — a type of phytonutrient with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects — up to eight-fold more than eating the salad on its own. Keep hard-boiled eggs on hand to embrace this powerhouse combo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salmon and Broccoli &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/calcium-and-vitamin-d-important-bone-health#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20promotes%20bone%20health,our%20muscles%20and%20immune%20system." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plays a crucial role;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plays a crucial role&lt;/a&gt; in helping your body absorb calcium. That makes salmon (which contains the vitamin) and broccoli (a good source of calcium) an ideal pairing to help keep your bones strong, says Caravella. Tuna, egg yolks and tofu are other great sources of vitamin D that can be paired with calcium-rich foods like kale, collard greens and fortified dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turmeric and Black pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric is packed with antioxidants that help protect your cells, but its benefits are amplified when paired with black pepper. Pepper enhances turmeric’s bioavailability, which helps your body absorb its health-promoting properties, explains DeGore. So next time you make a golden latte or stir-fry, don’t forget to add a dash of pepper!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raspberries and Dark Chocolate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you’re craving a sweet treat, consider raspberries and dark chocolate. According to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S088915751500071X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, combining cocoa with raspberries can significantly enhance the antioxidant effects of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice and Beans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans are great source of protein, but they’re a bit limited because they don’t contain all nine amino acids that our bodies need to function. Eating a variety of proteins helps you get the essential amino acids it needs. Likewise, you can make a protein-packed plate by pairing a plant protein and a grain — like beans and rice. “On their own, they’re missing some essential amino acids, but together they deliver all nine that your body needs but cannot produce on their own,” says Carvella. “This duo is especially beneficial for those who primarily eat a plant-based diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Wheat Bread and Peanut Butter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole wheat bread and peanut butter are another powerful plant-based protein duo. Each one contains the amino acids that the other lacks so when you eat them together you can get all the amino acids you need. Ideally, look for bread that has whole-grain flour or whole-wheat flour listed as the first ingredient. You can also add sliced bananas to your sandwich for added fiber and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 13:21:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE52ZVU1NXdjQlhBTjkxQVg2MXA3cFJnMnBKNmtOVkZWYzJWR285Wktyc05NVmZ2OEtybndneXRFUUJuOFR5RlJ4ZTB4d1Bza3M5MThIR0pvN2RSSU80MEFmck9HNFNQXzBoNXNtdjQzSElra1U1UXc</guid></item><item><title>金毛小狗坚持自己走回家，我们痴迷于他的自信-雅虎 | Golden Retriever Puppy Insists on Walking Himself Home and We’re Obsessed with His Confidence - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNblQtcm51OHlZWUVYMjRuME00dGF1OXc0eXhNMjRFWUFadndyVzdWNUF6SzVpTFNjNktSc0U1RHpTUS1qS3V1T2JyRXdoak1zX1NrcENvcU9QYnViVE03bE85Qkl1QnhBOF9kNW83UWVHbTlvNk8yQkNHUXF1NUk0Q1pBZURiWnVtZFVpcXRB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Puppies are always eager to explore the world, but some, right from the start, take their independence very seriously and want to prove to the world they can do anything they set their mind do.

Cheers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another shared, “He thinks he's walking &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Someone else added, “They are all the same haha my 8mo old will still try to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One joked, “Look at me - I am the leash owner now!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other comments included, “Aww, I miss when my girl was that little and did that,” “He’s a strong independent floof that doesn’t need no hooman to lead him,” “C’mon hooman,” “Just a big boi doing big boi things,” and “My guy did this too when he was little. I use a belt leash, so I imagine in his mind this was him walking me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One user offered some advice, writing, “They may grow out of it, and they may not. My dog pulls on his leash at 8 from the point we put in on until we get to the driveway, and then it's not stop sniffs for however long the walk is. It's never too early to start the ‘hey don't chew that behaviors.’ My dog prefers the &lt;em&gt;nononono&lt;/em&gt; in a soft voice approach to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There's no convincing us that after this walk and his overpouring confidence that this Golden Retriever puppy didn't have the restful sleep. We hope so, at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-puppy-insists-on-walking-himself-home-and-were-obsessed-with-his-confidence" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever Puppy Insists on Walking Himself Home and We’re Obsessed with His Confidence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever Puppy Insists on Walking Himself Home and We’re Obsessed with His Confidence&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade Pets on May 23, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 13:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNblQtcm51OHlZWUVYMjRuME00dGF1OXc0eXhNMjRFWUFadndyVzdWNUF6SzVpTFNjNktSc0U1RHpTUS1qS3V1T2JyRXdoak1zX1NrcENvcU9QYnViVE03bE85Qkl1QnhBOF9kNW83UWVHbTlvNk8yQkNHUXF1NUk0Q1pBZURiWnVtZFVpcXRB</guid></item><item><title>如何进食以获得更好的睡眠- CNN | How to eat for better sleep - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5OMTlIZTFJZFpvOTBQOFBDbmltQXZueVY5OW54YkUtX0hiVFNtRUU5QnMwdGxNLTNhZmdHNGdfSnEyNEZWOFEwbHJORE0wdjBwS3JsSnpiYTRxUzVIc0xPWUlIeVBQOFhNSVh1MlpkTdIBdEFVX3lxTE1NZ241SWg1SHVOWFRfeF91UE9GNUVMdEFyTXhqeUJ0blBOb0oxOXdfRk5DTnZuSUpWU0RrRUtmX3gzT055TWE1SzRUdzhTcWoyeHRCVDdUTjVoWUJVZGhpelBsaUpRMXZlTnJIQ3ljUTdKWjhp?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            To prep for a good night’s sleep, start at breakfast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000e3b6mv11i1bey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What you eat throughout the day could affect your quality of sleep at night. Adding foods with the right nutrients could help you get to sleep, stay asleep and wake up more refreshed, according to Dr. Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000f3b6mf7yvy11z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Better-Sleep-Food-Sleep-Connection/dp/1982198443" target="_blank"&gt;Eat Better, Sleep Better&lt;/a&gt;: 75 Recipes and a 28-Day Meal Plan That Unlock the Food-Sleep Connection,” St-Onge presents research linking certain foods with the production of melatonin — and better rest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000g3b6mbkwukd8y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep and wake cycles. But the production of melatonin relies on tryptophan, an amino acid that people need to get from nutrients because the body can’t produce them, said St-Onge, who is also a professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000h3b6mii3z7rgo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While some ingredients in particular can help provide tryptophan or encourage melatonin production, just eating a handful of nuts right before bed isn’t going to do the trick, said Dr. Erica Jansen, assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000i3b6muc58bltr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The book is a good representation of the current science around sleep and food, which shows that the best approach to eating for better sleep focuses on what you eat throughout the day rather than prioritizing one food for a quick fix, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000j3b6mo9s8xwtv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s really what I see in my research as well –– that it’s a whole approach to eating,” Jansen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000k3b6m45vaycve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research suggests that overall, having a balanced, whole-food diet is helpful, St-Onge said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000l3b6m4uttpdam@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She recommends focusing on a diet heavy in plants (like fruits and vegetables) but also high in whole grains, fiber and protein sources that are lower in saturated fats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000m3b6mqoxiieyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Such foods include legumes such as chickpeas, lentils, tofu, nuts, seeds and beans, which are all good sources of tryptophan, according to the book.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000n3b6m8txxcn7x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When choosing carbohydrates, look for fiber-rich options, and avoid highly processed carbs such as cakes, cookies and crackers, St-Onge wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000o3b6makd9mwnq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Need more guidance? Eating a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/eat-but-better"&gt;Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/a&gt;, which is higher in fats from fish and olive oil, was associated with a lower risk of insomnia and more time spent sleeping, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30137563/" target="_blank"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; by St-Onge and her coauthors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000p3b6mmef41orm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other micronutrients also help support your body’s response to tryptophan and melatonin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000q3b6mvf9l717o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Add zinc to your diet with ingredients like almonds, oysters and wheat bran; magnesium with chia seeds, cashews and yogurt; vitamin B with bananas, chickpeas and tuna; and folate with broccoli, lentils and spinach, according to St-Onge’s book.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmazzmril00163b6muoinzqo3@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="melatonin-and-other-supplements-arent-as-helpful" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Melatonin and other supplements aren’t as helpful
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000r3b6mksr26ed4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It isn’t a matter of cutting everything that isn’t sleep-promoting out of your diet but rather working in more of sleep-promoting foods as you can, Jansen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000s3b6mqo8ki765@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you want to eat something that’s really not sleep-promoting, it’s not a big problem,” she said. “It’s not a very prescriptive diet.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000t3b6mpie8xi73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, it might not be a good idea to eat something sugary, spicy or caffeinated before bed, Jansen said. Focus on adding nutrients that promote sleep instead of restricting foods that don’t.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000u3b6mef3tpdcu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Can’t you just get melatonin or the nutrients that promote it from supplements? Not ideally, St-Onge said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000v3b6mg3j8khus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Supplements don’t always provide the right dosage or optimal form of a nutrient, she said. In many cases, nutrients work best paired together, whereas supplements often deliver the nutrient by itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000w3b6mm05oifmg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Getting nutrients from a balanced diet is generally healthier and safer than supplements,” St-Onge wrote. “Plus, absorbing nutrients from foods is more efficient than extracting them from supplements.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000x3b6m4q51gky5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though people who are already eating a nutrient-dense diet can do more to optimize their sleep, the ones who will likely benefit most are people who have poor diets, Jansen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000y3b6my8t2b32u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you want to add more whole foods with sleep-promoting nutrients into your day, dietitian Alexandra Babcock recommends starting with one meal, particularly one that needs more inspiration.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000z3b6minoz6bic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For some people, that’s breakfast. You can add one serving of fruit, vegetables or beans to your morning meal, Babcock said. She loves eating savory oatmeal with a poached egg and black beans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw00103b6mgor49u3a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you want to add more whole foods to your lunch, a salad with chickpeas is a good option, according to Babcock, who owns Nutrition Innovations in Austin, Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw00113b6munsg7nos@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chickpeas don’t have to be boring, Babcock added. “They can have flavor. They can be toasted and roasted in spices.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Small changes geared toward a healthier lifestyle often build on one another: Adjusting one meal could lead to more changes, which could motivate you to get more active — and, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/health/insomnia-exercise-wellness"&gt;exercise is linked&lt;/a&gt; to better sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw00133b6mt9zlj62w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lifestyle changes can help you get better sleep, but that might not be enough for people who have insomnia, Jansen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw00143b6mc6mnn613@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It does have to be kind of like a holistic approach,” she said. “For someone who has really significant sleep disorder, their sleep disorder really should be addressed by a physician at the same time that they’re improving their diets.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of six &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt; with a CVS, where a vein is found running through the center of a lesion, has a similar diagnostic accuracy as a spinal tap that tests for oligoclonal bands (OCBs) — a type of MS antibody — in the spinal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The findings of our research are particularly exciting as we have now shown that we can give the diagnosis of MS without this painful procedure,” Nikos Evangelou, MD, PhD, the study’s senior author and professor at the University of Nottingham, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/mri-can-replace-spinal-tap-to-diagnose-ms"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;. “With the MRI scan, it takes 8 minutes, is completely safe, and then you can go home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000017"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance of the Central Vein Sign and CSF Oligoclonal Bands Supporting the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Neurology Open Access&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the benefits for patients, the researchers think the advancement will lead to major cost savings by expediting diagnoses and avoiding complications that require care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On average, we think we will reach the diagnosis three months earlier and the change could save the [National Health Service] up to 5 million pounds each year, which can be reinvested in better services for our MS patients,” Evangelou said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Criteria for MS diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaching an &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;MS diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; can be challenging as there’s no definitive test to identify the disease. Clinicians rely on a combination of clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, with the decision governed by a set of guidelines called the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-diagnosis-mcdonald-criteria"&gt;McDonald criteria&lt;/a&gt;, which was updated in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per those guidelines, people who’ve had a bout of clinical symptoms suggestive of MS, called &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/clinically-isolated-syndrome-cis/"&gt;clinically isolated syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (CIS), must show that damage is happening in multiple places of the central nervous system (CNS, the brain and spinal cord) — a feature called dissemination in space — and at multiple points in time, or dissemination in time (DIT), to be formally diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former can be met when &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/"&gt;MRI scans&lt;/a&gt; show lesions characteristic of MS in multiple regions of the CNS. DIT can be proven by a second disease relapse or new signs of damage on MRI scans, but these can be replaced by the presence of OCBs, or antibodies that suggest CNS inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCBs are measured in a sample of spinal fluid collected with a lumbar puncture, where a thin needle is inserted into the spinal canal. But these antibodies aren’t 100% universal in MS and can be seen in other inflammatory diseases. Moreover, lumbar punctures are invasive, painful, and can lead to complications that require additional monitoring or hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/09/25/ectrims-2024-mcdonald-criteria-changes-speed-diagnoses/"&gt;proposed modifications&lt;/a&gt; to the McDonald criteria would let MS be diagnosed even if DIT isn’t present, provided other criteria are met. One of these would be CVS — an MRI finding believed to be &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/central-vein-sign-mri-diagnostic-marker-ms/"&gt;specific to MS&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, the proposed criteria would follow the so-called “rule of six,” where at least six lesions need to be found around a vein in imaging scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CVS vs. OCBs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05533905?term=NCT05533905&amp;amp;rank=1"&gt;DECISIVE clinical trial (NCT05533905)&lt;/a&gt; explored the diagnostic utility of CVS versus OCBs among adults with typical CIS. As part of it, 99 people in the U.K. underwent a MRI scan and a lumbar puncture. After an evaluation a year and a half later, 80 were diagnosed with MS, 10 were considered to have CIS, eight were diagnosed with a different condition, and one remained undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVS, established either with the rule of six or when at least 40% of evaluated lesions had a central vein, had similar diagnostic sensitivity as OCB, accurately predicting about 84%-91% of definite MS cases. CVS wasn’t as specific as OCBs, however, meaning it was more likely to call a case MS when it wasn’t. Still, the approaches had similar total diagnostic accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side effects were more common after a lumbar puncture (75%) than a MRI (9%), and some people (15%) needed time off work or their usual responsibilities to recover after a lumbar puncture. A small group of participants interviewed all preferred the MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings support CVS as a diagnostic test for centers that have the appropriate MRI equipment, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We expect that the overall number of patients requiring diagnostic [lumbar puncture] will reduce, thereby reducing the burden for patients and costs of health care services,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

But experts warn a lesser-known issue is on the rise, particularly among boys: muscle dysmorphia, aka &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-bigorexia_l_677d7df8e4b07acf439ce592" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="“bigorexia.”" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="677d7df8e4b07acf439ce592" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;“bigorexia.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bigorexia is a psychological condition and type of body dysmorphic disorder which involves a distorted self-image that focuses specifically on muscle size and physical appearance,” &lt;a href="https://www.newporthealthcare.com/who-we-are/healthcare-leadership/#kara-becker" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Kara Becker" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.newporthealthcare.com/who-we-are/healthcare-leadership/#kara-becker" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Kara Becker&lt;/a&gt;, a certified eating disorder therapist and national director of eating disorder programs at Newport Healthcare, told HuffPost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With bigorexia, the afflicted person is obsessed with becoming more muscular and preoccupied with the idea that their body isn’t brawny enough ― even if they actually have the physique of a bodybuilder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals may have an inaccurate view of their bodies, often believing they are smaller or less muscular,” said &lt;a href="https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/profile/amy-gooding" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Amy Gooding" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/profile/amy-gooding" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Amy Gooding&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist at Eating Recovery Center, Baltimore. “This belief and subsequent preoccupation can lead to unhealthy behaviors, including obsessive exercise, and may lead to changing one’s eating to be as lean as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although muscle dysmorphia can affect anyone, it’s more common in males, and research suggests the disorder is on the rise. &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2019/06/414726/22-young-men-5-young-women-engage-disordered-eating-bulk" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="A 2019 study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2019/06/414726/22-young-men-5-young-women-engage-disordered-eating-bulk" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;A 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; indicated that 22% of adolescent boys engaged in “muscularity-oriented disordered eating behaviors” in an attempt to bulk up or gain weight and found that supplements, dietary changes and even steroid use were common among young adult males. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating disorders in boys are often under-recognized and under-diagnosed, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jason.nagata" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Jason Nagata" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jason.nagata" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician specializing in eating disorders in boys and men, who co-authored the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that a &lt;a href="https://ca.style.yahoo.com/ontario-boys-eating-disorder-explainer-183123456.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="recent Canadian study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://ca.style.yahoo.com/ontario-boys-eating-disorder-explainer-183123456.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;recent Canadian study&lt;/a&gt; found that hospitalizations for eating disorders in male patients had risen dramatically since 2002. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there’s more awareness around eating disorders, muscle dysmorphia can be overlooked for several reasons ― one reason being that it can lead to behaviors often encouraged in the weight room,” Gooding said. “Lack of awareness of the disorder may lead to the disorder being missed in someone who is struggling, as this is one of the less well-known disorders. Those who struggle may hesitate to reach out for help due to shame, secrecy or the normalization of the behaviors in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s fueling the rise of bigorexia in kids and young adults?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are many potential causes and influences, including biological, psychological and sociocultural factors that can contribute to the development of this disorder,” Becker said. “A family history of mental health conditions, especially disorders related to body image or anxiety, may increase the chance of developing bigorexia. Likewise, people with low self-esteem, perfectionism or obsessive-compulsive tendencies are more vulnerable to developing this disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trauma and bullying are potential risk factors for bigorexia as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bodybuilders and other people who lift weights are at a higher risk than the general population,” Nagata said. “Competitive athletes are more at risk than noncompetitive athletes. Athletes who lift weights to change the appearance of their bodies are at higher risk than those who focused on improving performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts who spoke to HuffPost agreed that one of the biggest factors contributing to the rise of bigorexia is the proliferation of social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not only are young people consuming body ideals from the media, but they feel pressure to produce content and display their own bodies on social media,” Nagata said. “Men’s bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts. Constant comparisons to these idealized bodies may lead to body dissatisfaction and bigorexia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overemphasis on an idealized physical appearance in media and advertising is particularly harmful for younger boys, who might not fully appreciate that influencers and celebrities actually make their livelihood off images of their bodies. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPOzOanrNyg" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a different reality" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPOzOanrNyg" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;a different reality&lt;/a&gt; that is unattainable (not to mention undesirable) for most people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TikTokers and other social media influencers are making millions of dollars by getting likes and followers, which they then invest in professional trainers, full-time chefs, and other experts to curate and maintain their image,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bryant.edu/academics/faculty/trunzo-joseph" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Joseph J. Trunzo" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.bryant.edu/academics/faculty/trunzo-joseph" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Joseph J. Trunzo&lt;/a&gt;, a psychology professor and associate director of the School of Health &amp;amp; Behavioral Sciences at Bryant University in Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed to celebrities such as Hugh Jackman, who has trained for hours a day and even undergone &lt;a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/bodybuilders-dehydrate-before-competition-techniques-hugh-jackman-reddit" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="supervised dehydration regimens" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/bodybuilders-dehydrate-before-competition-techniques-hugh-jackman-reddit" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;supervised dehydration regimens&lt;/a&gt; to transform his body for screen roles. “Most 15-year-old kids” do not think about these facts when they see images of Jackman looking ripped and instead might develop dissatisfaction with their own bodies, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s not even taking into consideration the misleading role of filters, angles, poses, makeup and editing in those images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Influencers may take thousands of images and pick the best one, with the best lighting or enhancements, to curate the ideal version of themselves,” Trunzo added. “None of it is real. In short, we are constantly exposed to unrealistic, idealized and glamorized versions of the human body at a rate that we have never experienced before. In the hands of an impressionable young person, this is a very dangerous dynamic and recipe for psychological disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment sections also expose posters and viewers to harsh critiques about people’s bodies, which can fuel more insecurity and low self-esteem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For those struggling with muscle dysmorphia, seeing pictures and messaging on social media may cause a person to have harmful thoughts about the need to change their body,” Gooding said. “They may start to train more in the gym and worry about losing body fat to enhance their muscular bodies. Soon this training becomes excessive and obsessive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can parents do? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways parents can help counteract the forces that fuel body image issues and psychological disorders like bigorexia. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Limit social media consumption as much as possible, but recognize that you cannot eliminate it altogether,” Trunzo advised. “Your child will be exposed to these images, so talk to them about what they are seeing. Listen to what they say, how they interpret what they see, make sure they understand the reality behind what they are viewing and are not ‘buying’ the image.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also recommended emphasizing values of human worth and dignity that go beyond physical appearance. Focus on qualities like kindness, creativity, humor, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to provide support by creating a safe space for open conversations,” Becker said. “Be a positive role model by demonstrating a healthy attitude toward your own body and self-esteem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to the comments you make about your own bodies in front of your children and the attitudes toward exercise and food you’re displaying. Be mindful of the kinds of messages your kids are getting from their entertainment and social media activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents should challenge unhealthy and unhelpful messaging about ‘perfect bodies’ and social acceptance,” Gooding advised. “Body diversity should be discussed and praised. Conversations surrounding exercise should include messages about proper fueling, refueling, rest and balance in workouts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When images of buff celebrities appear on your child’s radar, provide context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been having conversations with my 9-year-old son like, ‘Let’s read what Hugh Jackman said about what he had to do to transform into Wolverine and look like this,’” said therapist &lt;a href="https://nourishedsoulcenter.com/cherie/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cherie Miller" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nourishedsoulcenter.com/cherie/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Cherie Miller&lt;/a&gt;, who is CEO and clinical director at Nourished Soul Center for Healing. “It’s a chance to say, ‘You know, this isn’t normal, this isn’t realistic, and this is not something that we should try to attain.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She focuses “body respect” ― reminding her children that we care about our bodies and want to take care of them, so we do things like drinking enough water, getting enough sleep and eating a variety of foods. The goal is to avoid extremes and know that bodies are great because of the functions they serve in helping us live our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Talking about body diversity as a good and natural thing is important too,” Miller said. “Life would be boring if we all looked the same. So isn’t it great that we come at all sizes and shapes and colors. Look at all the different plants and animals in the world too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If parents believe their child is being bullied or teased about their appearance, they should take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early intervention and treatment are vital to stopping the progression of muscle dysmorphia,” Gooding said. “If a parent recognizes behavior that may cause concern for the child, parents should engage in conversation with their child about the thought process surrounding their exercise behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagata shared some typical warning signs for muscle dysmorphia, urging parents to take note if their child develops a preoccupation or obsession with weight, food, exercise or appearance in a manner that “worsens their quality of life and impairs their social, school or daily functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For instance, some boys spend all of their waking hours exercising and feel guilty if they are not at the gym,” he said. “They may no longer eat with their families or friends because of rigid concerns about their nutrition and diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect your child is starting to struggle with bigorexia, know that they are not alone and there are resources that can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Boys with muscle dysmorphia or eating disorders should seek professional help,” Nagata said. “They can discuss these issues with a primary care pediatrician. Eating disorders and muscle dysmorphia are best supported by an interdisciplinary team including a mental health, medical and nutrition provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

I found myself having difficulty falling asleep and, even when I did, waking up in the middle of the night. As a freelancer who makes my own schedule, I attempted to fill in the gaps with occasional naps, but it was still a vicious cycle of feeling constantly exhausted during the day, only to not be able to doze off when my head hit the pillow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, I didn't think my issues were serious enough to warrant a doctor's visit (and didn't want to deal with the hassle of potentially having to find and see a specialist), so I turned to what I thought was the next best option: Unisom, an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g39284222/best-sleep-aids/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g39284222/best-sleep-aids/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="over-the-counter sleep aid" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="1.1.0"&gt;over-the-counter sleep aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s just one problem about taking this sleep shortcut: meds like Unisom, a.k.a. doxylamine succinate—which are found in both OTC sleep aids &lt;em data-node-id="1.3"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; allergy meds—are actually pretty bad for your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Though most sleep aids and certain &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g36446792/best-otc-allergy-medicine/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g36446792/best-otc-allergy-medicine/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="allergy med" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.1.0"&gt;allergy med&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; labels indicate that they're not intended for long-term use, they often don’t say why. A close friend who is also a physician clued me into why these OTC options aren't ideal: Frequent use of antihistamines that fall into the category of first-generation antihistamines has been tied to an increased risk of dementia. In fact, a study published this year in the &lt;a href="https://www.worldallergyorganizationjournal.org/article/S1939-4551(25)00002-X/fulltext" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.worldallergyorganizationjournal.org/article/S1939-4551(25)00002-X/fulltext" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World Allergy Organization Journal" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="2.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.3.0.0"&gt;World Allergy Organization Journal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests people should avoid taking Benadryl, which is a first-gen antihistamine, altogether. (And, BTW, these meds were put on the market all the way back in 1946, before they were required to undergo safety testing, according to research by the the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-journal-of-allergy-and-clinical-immunology-in-practice" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-journal-of-allergy-and-clinical-immunology-in-practice" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology" data-node-id="2.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="2.5.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.5.0.0"&gt;Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This is a serious concern among medical experts, says Pamela Tambini, MD, an internal medicine physician and medical director at Engage Wellness. "People sometimes assume these medications must be harmless because they are sold over the counter, but if you use them too often or for too long, they can mess with your thinking, make you groggy during the day, and possibly lead to long-term problems," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So while they might be safe to take every once in a while, here's why doctors strongly recommend considering other options for sleep or allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0"&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://engagewellnessnow.com/contributor/dr-pamela-tambini/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://engagewellnessnow.com/contributor/dr-pamela-tambini/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pamela Tambini" data-node-id="6.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.2.0"&gt;Pamela Tambini&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a Palm Beach Gardens, FL-based double board-certified physician in internal and addiction medicine and medical director at Engage Wellness in Acton, MA, Seetha Bhagavatula, MD, a Maryland-based board-certified geriatrician and internal medicine physician at &lt;a href="https://remo.health/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://remo.health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Remo Health" data-node-id="6.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.4.0"&gt;Remo Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="heres-why-first-generation-antihistamines-are-bad-for-your-brain-health" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;Here’s why first generation antihistamines are bad for your brain health.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;First, a quick refresher on what antihistamines are exactly. Antihistamines are medications that work primarily to block histamine, a chemical released by the immune system during allergic reactions or infections, says Seetha Bhagavatula, MD, a board-certified geriatrician and internal medicine physician at Remo Health. Histamine is what causes the uncomfortable allergy symptoms you might experience like a runny nose, itchy eyes, or irritated skin. Luckily, “by preventing histamine from binding to its receptors, antihistamines effectively reduce these allergy-related symptoms throughout the body," says Dr. Bhagavatula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;They’re an easily available solve for people with mild seasonal allergies, but these meds affect more than just your runny nose. They also make you sleepy (which is why they pop up in OTC sleep medications) and affect many other systems in your body, Dr. Tambini says. "Since histamine also helps keep you awake, blocking it makes you feel sleepy, which is why they’re often used in sleep aids—they sort of sedate you as a side effect," Dr. Tambini says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;However, patients with allergic rhinitis (commonly known as "hay fever") taking first-generation antihistamines face an increased risk of developing dementia, according to a 2024 study in the &lt;a href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(24)00541-5/abstract" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(24)00541-5/abstract" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="10.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.1.0.0"&gt;Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study also found some risk with second-generation antihistamines, but the risk was far lower. "There might still be a slight risk for cognitive effects," says dr. Tambini. "However, that risk is very low for most healthy adults taking them occasionally or even seasonally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That’s because there’s another major system certain antihistamines affect: Your brain. Older antihistamines, known as first-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (ZzzQuil) and doxylamine (Unisom) cross into the brain and block histamine receptors there, whereas second-generation antihistamines were designed to avoid that, says Dr. Tambini. They specifically target acetylcholine—which happens to be a key brain chemical involved in memory, focus, and learning. This makes an impact on long-term brain health, according to the research. Frequent sleep medication use was associated with an increased risk of dementia in older adults, highlighting that risk may vary by race as well, according to a 2023 study in the &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-221006" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-221006" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Journal of Alzheimer's Disease" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="12.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="12.1.0.0"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"If you are constantly dampening that system with these medications, your brain does not function as well," Dr. Tambini says. "Over time, that can lead to memory issues or even contribute to cognitive decline, particularly if you’re already at risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In older adults, these medications can also cause confusion or even increase the risk of falling, but the biggest concern is how they impact the brain over time, especially when used frequently, Dr. Tambini says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Medications that contain first-generation antihistamines:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="16" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="16.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0.0"&gt;For sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Unisom (doxylamine succinate), Sominex (diphenhydramine HCl), Tylenol Simply Sleep (diphenhydramine HCl), ZzzQuil (diphenhydramine HCl)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="16.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.1.0"&gt;For allergies:&lt;/strong&gt; Benadryl (diphenhydramine), Chlor-Trimeton (chlorpheniramine), Dramamine (dimenhydrinate), Vicks NyQuil (doxylamine succinate)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="theyre-also-not-even-that-helpful-for-your-sleep-either" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-atzu3h emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;They’re also not even that helpful for your sleep, either.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you've ever taken these meds to help you sleep, you may find you knock out and sleep hard on the first night that you're particularly exhausted. But as you continue them, you might also feel groggy or foggy the next morning, even if you slept a full eight hours, making their intended use backfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;These meds actually worsen your sleep quality in the long run, even if they still help you fall asleep fast, Dr. Tambini says. "These meds can reduce REM sleep—the deep, dream-filled sleep that really restores your brain," she explains. "So you might technically be asleep for hours but still wake up feeling sluggish or unrefreshed because it's like getting the quantity of sleep without the quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="what-to-take-instead-of-first-generation-antihistamines" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-atzu3h emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;What To Take Instead Of First-Generation Antihistamines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;What's more important than finding the perfect sleep aid is nailing why exactly you're looking to find one, especially if you may have other underlying health factors that could increase negative side effects, says Dr. Bhagavatula. Whether it’s stress, poor sleep hygiene, side effects of another medication, or insomnia, you’re going to want to get to the bottom of your sleep issues to find the best treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"Sleep is complex, and while reaching for a quick fix might be tempting, those fixes sometimes cause more problems than they solve," Dr. Tambini says. "There are safer, more effective options out there—and talking to your doctor is a great first step in figuring out what’s really going on and how to get your sleep back on track."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But, it &lt;em data-node-id="24.1"&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; okay to occasionally use an OTC sleep aid such as Unisom or ZzzQuil in a pinch, she says. "Taking something for a night or two can be fine if you’re dealing with a temporary sleep issue—like jet lag or stress before a big event," Dr. Tambini says. "[But once you] build up a tolerance, which can happen in just one to two weeks of regular use, they stop working as well, and your body starts relying on them, you’re not actually addressing the root cause of why you can’t sleep in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Long-term, both Dr. Tambini and Dr. Bhagavatula advise looking into solutions that *don’t* affect your brain health, which include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="for-sleep" data-node-id="27" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;For Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Alternatives to something like ZzzQuil include supplements like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64019685/melatonin-dna-repair-study/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64019685/melatonin-dna-repair-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="melatonin" data-node-id="28.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="28.1.0"&gt;melatonin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and valerian root, which some people find helpful, according to Dr. Tambini (but the science isn’t completely settled on yet, per a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7585905/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7585905/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Journal of Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine" data-node-id="28.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="28.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="28.3.0.0"&gt;Journal of Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re really struggling to catch some Zzzs, though, both docs recommend cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which is the most effective treatment, per a 2022 study in &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362185028_Cognitive_Behavioral_Therapy_for_Insomnia_CBT-I_A_Primer" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362185028_Cognitive_Behavioral_Therapy_for_Insomnia_CBT-I_A_Primer" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clinical Psychology and Special Education" data-node-id="29.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="29.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="29.1.0.0"&gt;Clinical Psychology and Special Education&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It helps you build better sleep habits and teaches your brain how to sleep again, says Dr. Tambini. This is something that takes multiple sessions to work, so it’s not quite an in-the-moment fix like popping a melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And, there are a few prescriptions that doctors have at their disposal, too.

It was a complete shock to us all,' Ms Hunt said of his diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors assured the family they had a 'full plan' and that Mr Haston would start chemotherapy and be a good candidate for a stem cell transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But during his two rounds of chemotherapy he developed life-threatening pneumonia, which eventually resulted in multiple organ failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He died within two days of becoming ill with the lung disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shortly before his death, Mr Hunt had been making plans for his retirement with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He didn't get to enjoy one day of retirement with my mum or do any of the future they had planned together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Haston was dealing with some constipation, which his GP gave him laxatives for. But he was also really fatigued with muscle weakness and 'just didn't look right'. Above, his wife Anne Haston (left) and stepdaughter Beth Hunt (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;His wife took him to A&amp;amp;E—where tests found his kidney function had plummeted to just 14 per cent and he had extremely high calcium levels. He was eventually diagnosed with myeloma, a deadly a type of bone marrow cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'If Ronnie hadn’t been so unwell by the time he got into hospital, he would have been in a better position to fight it,' said Ms Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of the disease—which include back pain, broken bones, fatigue, and recurring infection—are often missed and instead linked to just general ageing or minor conditions and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Constipation is a lesser-known symptom, caused by a build up of calcium in the blood triggered by the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Hunt added: 'It's not people's fault, it's the system's fault. The catalogue of errors, the wait. We kept saying, "he needs a blood test", but he couldn't get one for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In this day and age how is that acceptable? If somebody is unwell, you need the blood test now. Even in hospital, it was all too little too late. The big thing for me is educating GPs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In honour of her stepfather, mum-of-two Beth has started a&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/beths-miles-for-myeloma"&gt; JustGiving &lt;/a&gt;page and decided to run the Edinburgh Marathon to raise money for Myeloma UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are an estimated 6,000 new cases of myeloma per year in the UK, with more than 35,000 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It occurs due to changes in immune system cells called plasma cells, which replicate at a faster rate and cause a host of problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There are an estimated 6,000 new cases of myeloma per year in the UK, with more than 35,000 in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's often called multiple myeloma because it can be found in several places — wherever there is bone marrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While chemotherapy can reduce the number of myeloma cells, doctors aren't yet able to eradicate them completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking of her upcoming marathon challenge Ms Hunt said: 'I know I can do at least half but I’ll probably have to push through the last six miles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I tend to run at night when my husband’s here and the children are sleeping. I think of Ronnie and my mum when I run – the last year without him has been awful for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If she can wake up without him and can put one foot in front of the other then I can take it one step at a time too.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The rest are due to complications from localized tumors or blood cancers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When you look at the literature, you quickly realize that 70 percent of cancer patients do not succumb to the primary tumor, but the metastatic spread,’ Rodriguez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After years of research in chemical biology that can be leveraged to fight cancer , Dr Raphael Rodriguez and his team have developed a molecule that could save millions from deaths caused by the cancer spreading to other parts of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I realized the gap. The treatments we have are not sufficient — they are not designed to target metastasis, and they are not designed to target the capacity of a cell to migrate.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer cells hoard iron in special compartments called lysosomes, which makes them more aggressive — but also gives them a hidden weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That same iron can trigger a process called ferroptosis, which destroys the cancer cell from the inside out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rodriguez said: ‘We conceptualize the fact that cancer cells can exploit iron chemistry to adapt, to change identity, to be plastic, to become invasive.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But at the same time, he said, iron is chemically active (redox-active), meaning it easily reacts with molecules in cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The paper that we just published exploits that finding, basically: could we develop a compound that would accumulate inside of the cell where iron is loaded, and can we manipulate the chemistry of iron?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rodriguez, a French biochemist, helped develop Fentomycin-1, a molecule that supercharges ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In early lab tests, metastatic cancer cells were wiped out in less than 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cancer cells aggressively stockpile iron in lysosomes to fuel their spread—but this creates a fatal flaw. The same iron can trigger ferroptosis, a self-destruct mechanism that corrodes tumors from within&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And this was spectacular,’ Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘At this point in time, cancer patients are dying — specifically in this population [with these cancers]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And it was very gratifying for us to see that we are capable of designing a compound that does what we wanted to do.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team tested Fento-1 in aggressive forms of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and sarcomas, a group of rare malignant tumors that form in bones or soft tissues — all known for drug resistance, high iron levels, and grim survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mice injected with breast cancer cells, the drug slowed tumor growth and activated the immune system, potentially offering a one-two punch with existing treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also worked well in combination with chemotherapy, especially in pancreatic cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rodriguez’s lab even tested tumor samples taken directly from patients after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The compound reduced the number of cells with CD44, a protein that helps cancer resist drugs and spread to new organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rodriguez's team tested Fento-1 in aggressive forms of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and sarcomas, a group of rare malignant tumors that form in bones or soft tissues — all known for drug resistance, high iron levels, and grim survival rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because cancer cells have higher iron levels than surrounding healthy tissue, Fento-1 can target tumors with precision, leaving normal cells relatively unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical trials will be needed to determine if these molecules could be leveraged as new cancer treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before then, Rodriguez said, his team will have to raise funds for the next stage of research, which will establish basic knowledge about how the compound might interact with living human cells in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Rodriguez is clear — getting there will take funding, testing, and more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There are a few other [data sets] that are not published, and what we now need to do is [figure out] can we scale up the compound, is it stable, is it bioavailable, can we take it by IV, how does it get decomposed inside the body, what is the clearance of it?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘At this point in time,’ he added, ‘we are happy with the compound we made.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His team's findings were published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08974-4"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Metastatic cancer cells are adept at resisting chemotherapy by developing ways to prevent the medicine from entering the cell, and radiation treatments, by learning how to repair any damage done to their DNA to help them survive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When cancer cells spread beyond their original site in the body, or metastasize, it becomes markedly more difficult to treat and reach remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metastatic cancer cells can adapt to new, hostile environments, such as unfamiliar organs and tissues, adjusting their metabolism and outsmarting the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also adept at resisting chemotherapy by developing ways to prevent the medicine from entering the cell, and radiation treatments, by learning how to repair any damage done to their DNA to help them survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimating the exact number of Americans living with metastatic cancer at any single time is challenging due to limited real-time tracking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Cancer Institute estimated in 2018 that there were &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/ocs?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template#:~:text=Researchers%20at%20the%20National%20Cancer,693%2C452%20by%20the%20year%202025."&gt;more than 623,000&lt;/a&gt; people in the US living with the six most common metastatic cancers - bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, prostate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That rate was expected to increase to nearly 700,000 in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 04:48:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPdWw5VzdjRHRrdW1TV3BPa1VXWXY2c3BsYUlQZ0JnbnlYRlNJaFQwdGd5TEdFR2V5Vk9Kd1pMVGdkSUVFYkNQQVBDdF9TWlJBZ2pQNUY4N3o1VVRNakRSb2dickhheldlTGwtVGN0eS1xRndEdkgtWkRucTZDNC1EWEdNWnQyNklPS1V3OHlwbUtsdGt1WVRBRXlJQ05KRzBVY3N5ZtIBqgFBVV95cUxQRDFtdDV5NUlaaTFWM1JMRFJYdlkzdC0wdnJ1VVpsaHNvMElKdWZTMEMwc1J1VnRpbDE3S0xMUEFobHhjTnlPQTlmNGdaRzF5bWU4NlVlYl96RGgtUktxaF9xME5QTGdGaS1SOERITXM0RVU3WjFzdTBqM21iQjlyWlpUbjdHN251TUZBM3dHU01uM1N5OHd6cmNXSWFyNVA5M0dHd2FhZmFjUQ</guid></item><item><title>睡眠不好3晚后，您的心脏开始受苦- ScienceAlert | Your Heart Begins to Suffer After Just 3 Nights of Bad Sleep - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOZVZLTlVwN0ZDU0JucEVOS1FQc08xRjRfNzR2WUd1MTk2alNmZ2xjZkR6NDNLaEQtWTRzZHNIV3Joa2g5bklLc3poWXVBVVhzNDBuS0JTTXE5MC1nNFFwN2o3MHBwSFhBc3ZkQzNQSWpVSFM4S3JkRkJSRXZxbnAyeklfckpBd09KdVEyRjh0SEM3bzg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We've long known that a lack of sleep is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32442289/"&gt;bad for the heart&lt;/a&gt; – but scientists are now starting to understand exactly how it causes harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://biomarkerres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40364-025-00776-0"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from Uppsala University in Sweden, researchers found that just three nights of restricted sleep – around four hours a night – triggered changes in the blood linked to a higher risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at inflammatory proteins in the blood. These are molecules the body produces when it is under stress or fighting off illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these proteins stay high for a long time, they can damage blood vessels and raise the risk of problems like heart failure, coronary heart disease and atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 16 healthy young men who spent several days in a lab, where everything from their meals to their activity levels and light exposure was carefully controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants followed two routines: three nights of normal sleep (8.5 hours) and three night of sleep restriction (4.25 hours). After each sleep phase, the men completed a short, high-intensity cycling workout, and their blood was tested before and after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured almost 90 different proteins in the blood samples. They found that sleep deprivation caused a clear rise in inflammatory markers linked to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while exercise usually boosts healthy proteins such as interleukin-6 and BDNF (which support brain and heart health), these responses were weaker after poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162472" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162472" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-642x428.jpg" alt="Your Heart Begins to Suffer After Just Three Nights of Bad Sleep" class="size-medium wp-image-162472" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162472" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Exercise usually boosts healthy proteins that support brain and heart health, but these responses were weaker after poor sleep. (Pekic/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Even young adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, the changes happened even in young, healthy adults, and after only a few nights of bad sleep. That's worrying given how common it is for adults to &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2022/0400/p397.html"&gt;experience poor sleep from time to time&lt;/a&gt; – and around &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589670"&gt;one in four people&lt;/a&gt; work shifts that disrupt sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that the time of day blood was taken mattered: protein levels varied between morning and evening, and even more so when sleep was restricted. This suggests that sleep affects not only what's in your blood, but when those changes are most visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although modern life often encourages us to trade sleep for productivity, socialising or screen time, studies like this remind us that the body keeps score – quietly, chemically and without compromise.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256534/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages spike blood sugar levels and may increase your risk of insulin resistance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These beverages are easy to overconsume and may lead to weight gain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting added sugars and prioritizing other healthy habits may reduce the risk of insulin resistance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s estimated that over 30% of American adults (approximately 86 million folks) have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, a health condition also known as impaired insulin sensitivity that can lead to type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And if you regularly drink sugar-sweetened beverages, you might be at risk. “When insulin sensitivity decreases, your body has a harder time processing carbohydrates efficiently. This can lead to more sugar in the blood, increased insulin levels, greater visceral fat storage and other metabolic issues,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsay-fencl-rd-cd-35a6251b2/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lindsay Fencl, RD, CD&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lifestyle factors, like physical inactivity, poor sleep and high stress, can all contribute to insulin resistance. However, diet—particularly sugar consumption—also plays a pivotal role. “There’s no single culprit, but regularly consuming ultra-processed foods high in added sugars—especially sugary drinks like soda, sweetened coffee beverages, energy drinks and juice cocktails—can increase the risk of insulin resistance over time,” says &lt;a href="https://sproutoutloud.com/about/#meet-ali" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ali McGowan, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Read on to discover why cutting back on high-sugar beverages is key to reducing your risk of insulin resistance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-should-you-limit-sugar-sweetened-beverages"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Should You Limit Sugar-Sweetened Beverages? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sugar-sweetened beverages include any drink that includes, well, sugar: soda, frappuccinos, sweet tea, energy or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7867963/electrolyte-drinks-what-are-they-and-do-you-need-them/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sports drinks&lt;/a&gt;, sweetened fruit juice and more. The amount of added sugar varies widely, with some beverages packing over 40 grams in a single serving. The type of sweetener also varies by product. Still, regardless of whether a beverage is sweetened with organic cane sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, research suggests that drinking these sweetened beverages regularly could increase your risk for insulin resistance and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-eating-too-much-sugar-cause-diabetes-8407724" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sugar-sweetened beverages have a high glycemic load, a measure that considers the number of carbohydrates in the food and how quickly those carbs are absorbed. Research suggests that this may be the driving force behind these beverages’ negative effects on insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“These drinks are quickly digested, leading to sharp blood sugar and insulin spikes without nutrients like fiber, protein or healthy fats that help slow digestion. Over time, these foods can disrupt the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar effectively,” says McGowan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another downside of the lack of fiber and protein is that these beverages aren’t particularly filling, and drinking them may cause you to consume excess calories throughout the day. Over time, this could lead to overweight or obesity—important risk factors for insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research has also linked sugar-sweetened beverage intake with an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-surprising-drink-that-could-increase-your-risk-of-heart-disease-11705434" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increased risk for heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and overall lower diet quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, how much added sugar is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292028/how-many-grams-of-sugar-should-you-eat-per-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;too much&lt;/a&gt;? The 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends consuming no more than 10% of calories from added sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For someone eating 2,000 calories per day, this would mean consuming no more than 12.5 teaspoons of added sugar per day—approximately the amount found in one 16-ounce bottle of soda.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, it’s estimated that the average American regularly exceeds this recommendation, consuming 17 teaspoons, or 68 grams, of added sugar daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you don’t have to say goodbye to your favorite drink forever, limiting sugar-sweetened beverages can have numerous benefits for your health, including reducing your risk for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Feeling thirsty? “For &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-no-added-sugar-drinks-blood-sugar-8747310" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hydration&lt;/a&gt;, water is always the MVP, but if you’re craving something fizzy, try seltzer with a splash of citrus or fresh fruit,” says McGowan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-habits-to-limit"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Habits to Limit &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No one food or habit can cause (or prevent) insulin resistance. Instead, it’s important to address your overall lifestyle. Here are a few other habits to cut back on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Not Getting Adequate Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prioritizing sleep is key—just one night of poor sleep can reduce insulin sensitivity,” says McGowan. Chronically inadequate sleep has been &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sleep-patterns-and-duration-may-determine-diabetes-risk-8683790" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;associated with type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and reductions in insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One small study in women found that reducing sleep duration to six hours per night for six weeks (down from seven hours or more) significantly impaired insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Neglecting Physical Activity &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Movement also makes a big impact: resistance training helps build muscle, which improves how your body responds to insulin, and a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/underrated-exercise-for-diabetes-11681859" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;short walk&lt;/a&gt; after meals can help lower blood sugar naturally,” says McGowan. Research supports this, showing that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7948870/the-best-exercises-to-do-if-you-have-prediabetes-according-to-personal-trainers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;moderate- to high-intensity exercise&lt;/a&gt; improves insulin sensitivity, with higher intensity having greater benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The American Diabetes Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/victoria-whittington-8609919" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Victoria Whittington, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Whether it’s walking, bicycling, swimming, dancing, roller skating or something else, daily movement has been shown to reduce the risk of insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders.”  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Being Chronically Stressed &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Don’t underestimate stress,” says McGowan. “Chronic stress can raise &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, which may interfere with blood sugar regulation over time.” Stress can occur in multiple ways, and stressors may often be outside of your control. However, finding ways to cope with stress is key. Meditation, yoga, journaling, going for a walk or talking with a therapist are just a few ways to support your emotional health and help keep stress levels in check.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Not Eating Enough Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbohydrates are often put on the “do not eat” list when it comes to managing insulin and blood sugar levels. However, the goal shouldn’t be to eliminate carbohydrates completely, but rather to focus on options that are high in fiber and other key nutrients. “The key is choosing the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7835397/good-carbs-bad-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;right types&lt;/a&gt; of carbohydrates and gradually reducing refined and ultra-processed carb options that are low in fiber, protein and micronutrients. Focus on increasing consumption of complex, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7994446/best-high-fiber-foods-for-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber-rich carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; like lentils, peas, nuts and seeds, oats, quinoa, berries, apples and whole grains,”  says Fencl.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you drink sugar-sweetened beverages regularly, it may be time to cut back. These beverages are high in added sugar and calories and low in key nutrients, like protein and fiber. As a result, they can spike blood sugar levels and contribute to weight gain, increasing your risk of insulin resistance over time. To help protect against insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, it’s best to avoid, or greatly limit, sugar-sweetened beverages. Getting seven to nine hours of sleep, staying physically active, managing stress levels and maintaining a healthy diet can also go a long way in promoting insulin sensitivity and keeping chronic diseases at bay.&lt;br&gt;

Longevity is not just about living longer, it’s about feeling good as you age — strong in body &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;mind. If anyone knows about healthy aging, it’s cardiologist Eric Topol, who studied “super agers” for decades. This week, we’re sharing a few things he learned while taking a look at these ultrahealthy older folks. First up? The secret to their success is not all about genetics. With a few lifestyle tweaks, you can dramatically increase your chances of becoming a super ager yourself. But before that …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;This week’s must-reads:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="LLQ3JXVEVJE73JUNCWKVZJZKUY" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rough night ahead?

But long covid is an umbrella term, and treating it as one disease is, in a way, equivalent to thinking cancer is one entity as opposed to hundreds of types, each with different diagnostics, prognosis and treatments, Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, told our writer Richard Sima, a former neuroscientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K32YAOJ4NVBTTEF4MSK3ULPFOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s why researchers are pressing ahead with new clinical trials for more targeted treatments built on advances in our understanding of long covid. And we’re learning more every day about the condition. “It is a constellation of many things, and dissecting out those things is going to be the biggest challenge,” said Janna Moen, a neuroscientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O6UKG27ORFHQJABOZFNRXQZHBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Learn more here &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/16/long-covid-treatments-trial-immune-system/" target="_blank"&gt;about clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; that are underway to unravel all the long-covid subtypes and biological pathways that cause this devastating condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="HLWMMVLSKNBBJPMEFN6OH7CQXU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="HLWMMVLSKNBBJPMEFN6OH7CQXU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why are colorectal cancer rates rising in young adults?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7GISK2JFOJDPXFRCUDOHSFGQ5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Ask a Doctor columnist is Trisha S.

But for younger adults, the trend is rapidly going in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6059239/#djw322-F1" target="_blank"&gt;wrong direction&lt;/a&gt;. While the overall numbers are still relatively low, colorectal cancer will become the leading cause of &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2778204" target="_blank"&gt;cancer-related deaths&lt;/a&gt; for adults in their 20s, 30s and 40s by 2030. In a study recently published in Nature, scientists unveiled a link between the rise in young colorectal cancers and a toxin called colibactin, which is produced by certain bacteria in the gut. Turns out, 30 to 40 percent of healthy adults have colibactin-producing bacteria, although only a small percentage of people get cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TRL4JEUVW5COXPPGFBF5IY73AI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Read more here from Trisha on the one thing you can do to help reduce the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/19/why-colorectal-cancer-rising-young-people/" target="_blank"&gt;impact of colibactin&lt;/a&gt; on your digestive tract.

They are bending over a table looking at data and a paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;getty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heather Candrilli, 36, a mother of two, is battling metastatic colon cancer, underscoring the urgent need for education, research and advocacy for young adults facing &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adairalandry/2024/04/29/advanced-stage-colorectal-cancer-in-young-adults-is-a-growing-crisis/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/adairalandry/2024/04/29/advanced-stage-colorectal-cancer-in-young-adults-is-a-growing-crisis/" target="_self" aria-label="rising rates of the disease"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/adairalandry/2024/04/29/advanced-stage-colorectal-cancer-in-young-adults-is-a-growing-crisis/"&gt;rising rates of the disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her journey began two years ago with persistent abdominal bloating and rectal bleeding. “I had just delivered my son and assumed the symptoms were postpartum related,” she recalls. Even during a visit to urgent care, she mentioned the bleeding and was told by a clinician, “It’s probably just from internal hemorrhoids.” Over the following year, her symptoms worsened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After speaking with her physician, an ultrasound and colonoscopy confirmed that Candrilli had colon cancer that had already spread to her liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has completed 21 rounds of chemotherapy and had the tumor surgically removed from her colon. However, her liver tumors remain. She’s now on the liver transplant list — awaiting a &lt;a href="https://openredcap.nyumc.org/apps/redcap/surveys/?s=YJ9DHHJJ9A&amp;amp;fbclid=PAY2xjawJrQ95leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp2lYVz5VuAQhOSIgBWuNSAPbwLrVsq0O6iNDR9UwMWdYBuYl0SgrRYyhAx0M_aem_XlVzffU5RYjsuI4Tkth4jg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://openredcap.nyumc.org/apps/redcap/surveys/?s=YJ9DHHJJ9A&amp;amp;fbclid=PAY2xjawJrQ95leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp2lYVz5VuAQhOSIgBWuNSAPbwLrVsq0O6iNDR9UwMWdYBuYl0SgrRYyhAx0M_aem_XlVzffU5RYjsuI4Tkth4jg" aria-label="donor match"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://openredcap.nyumc.org/apps/redcap/surveys/?s=YJ9DHHJJ9A&amp;amp;fbclid=PAY2xjawJrQ95leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp2lYVz5VuAQhOSIgBWuNSAPbwLrVsq0O6iNDR9UwMWdYBuYl0SgrRYyhAx0M_aem_XlVzffU5RYjsuI4Tkth4jg"&gt;donor match&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and funds to cover her &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-heathers-battle-against-cancer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-heathers-battle-against-cancer" aria-label="medical costs"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-heathers-battle-against-cancer"&gt;medical costs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — the next hopeful step toward becoming cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-3" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Heather Candrilli&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;Cory Candrili&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Causes Colon Cancer in Young Adults?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scientists are especially motivated to find the cause of colon cancer because its incidence is rising — particularly among younger adults who traditionally haven’t been considered high-risk,” said Dr. Austin Chiang, gastroenterologist and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gut-Owners-Guide-Literacy-Library/dp/B0C2GXC3MM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Gut-Owners-Guide-Literacy-Library/dp/B0C2GXC3MM" aria-label="Gut: An Owner's Guide"&gt;&lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Gut-Owners-Guide-Literacy-Library/dp/B0C2GXC3MM"&gt;Gut&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.amazon.com/Gut-Owners-Guide-Literacy-Library/dp/B0C2GXC3MM"&gt;: An Owner's Guide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While some cases may be linked to genetic mutations, many, like Candrilli’s, are not. She has no family history of colon cancer and tested negative for genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are now exploring how the gut microbiome — the trillions of bacteria and other microorganisms that live in our digestive system — may influence cancer risk. These microbes help digest food, regulate the immune system and, in some cases, produce toxins that interact with our bodies in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Interactions with gut bacteria might be playing a bigger role than previously thought,” added Dr. Chiang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging research supports this hypothesis. A recent &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; study highlights &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" aria-label="colibactin"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;colibactin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a toxin produced by certain gut bacteria, like &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, which may damage DNA in colon cells and contribute to cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Screening and modifiable lifestyle factors remain essential methods of colorectal cancer prevention,” said Dr. Angella Charnot-Katsikas, clinical pathologist and expert in molecular genetics at Loyola University Medicine. “But the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; article shows that microbiome-derived ‘genotoxins’ may initiate cancer, even without traditional risk factors.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;She explained that researchers used whole-genome sequencing on 981 colorectal cancer genomes and linked specific DNA “signatures” to colibactin-producing bacteria. “Colibactin can leave a permanent ‘fingerprint’ in the colon that may induce cancer,” she said, and while these findings are compelling, “we still don’t know the cause of most early-onset colorectal cancers not tied to inherited genes.” So while the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper made a major contribution, she awaits more research before these findings alter clinical strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prevention and Early Detection of Colon Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-6 alignleft" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Sticky note reminder to schedule colonoscopy to screen for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;getty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, early detection remains vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best place to start is with a gastroenterologist, especially if there’s a family history," Dr. Chiang said. "Screening is crucial, and guidelines now recommend beginning regular colon cancer screening at age 45.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also recommends resources like the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/health-care-professionals/american-cancer-society-prevention-early-detection-guidelines/colorectal-cancer-screening-guidelines.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cancer.org/health-care-professionals/american-cancer-society-prevention-early-detection-guidelines/colorectal-cancer-screening-guidelines.html" aria-label="American Cancer Society"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cancer.org/health-care-professionals/american-cancer-society-prevention-early-detection-guidelines/colorectal-cancer-screening-guidelines.html"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/colorectal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cancer.gov/types/colorectal" aria-label="National Cancer Institute"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cancer.gov/types/colorectal"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening at age 45 is an improvement from the previous recommendation of 50. Yet the lowered age still overlooks people like Candrilli and thousands like her — diagnosed with advanced colon cancer before age 45. New York State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton has introduced a bill that would &lt;a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/jessica-scarcella-spanton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/jessica-scarcella-spanton" aria-label="lower the colorectal cancer screening age to 35"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/jessica-scarcella-spanton"&gt;lower the colorectal cancer screening age to 35&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the change would apply only to New York residents, Scarcella-Spanton said legislation passed in her state “could put pressure on other states” to follow suit. If passed, her bill would require insurance companies to cover costs of colorectal cancer screening starting at 35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance coverage is critical; under current policies, Candrilli had to pay $500 out of pocket for her colonoscopy — an amount that could &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adairalandry/2024/03/06/fear-of-medical-debt-drives-patients-to-skip-care/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/adairalandry/2024/03/06/fear-of-medical-debt-drives-patients-to-skip-care/" target="_self" aria-label="deter some patients from seeking care"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/adairalandry/2024/03/06/fear-of-medical-debt-drives-patients-to-skip-care/"&gt;deter some patients from seeking care&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Lowering the screening age could also help shift public perception: colon cancer is no longer just a disease of the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-7" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Heather and Cory Candrilli with their children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;Family Photo&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candrilli’s hope is not only to heal, but to help young adults recognize symptoms of colon cancer early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t know what cancer symptoms are, unfortunately you may be incorrectly deterred,” she said, urging patients to advocate for themselves. “Don't brush off small symptoms. If you have rectal bleeding or bloating after eating small meals, this isn't normal. You aren't supposed to feel mediocre. You are supposed to feel good.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Ozempic user loves how her face looks after losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it’s become so normalized for people to lose weight using GLP-1 — many are suffering from its bizarre side effects, like “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/25/health/people-with-ozempic-face-are-doing-this-to-fight-wrinkles-and-sagging/"&gt;Ozempic face&lt;/a&gt;,”  except for a woman named Alejandra Salomon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salomon noticed a big difference in how her face looked after she took Semaglutide, a compound version of Ozempic, to lose weight for her sister’s wedding. 60 pounds lighter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many Ozempic users complain about their faces looking “hollowed out” or sagging — but Salomon experienced the opposite.
 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jam Press/@actuallyal__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While experts will say that Ozempic and similar weight loss drugs “… make the face look much older,” Dr. Patrick Byrne, president of the &lt;a href="https://www.aafprs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery&lt;/a&gt; (AAFPRS), told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salomon — who is in her late twenties — feels the opposite. “My weight loss made me look 10 years younger – no Botox needed,” she told NeedToKnow.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;While some Ozempic faces are appearing older with sunken cheeks, gaunt eyes and sagging neck skin — that doesn’t seem to be the case for Saloman as she’s thrilled with how young her face looks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It looks like I got jawline filler but really, I lost 60lbs and got in the best shape of my life,” she told NeedToKnow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 20-something-year-old started taking the weight loss drug “…because my parents thought it would be a good idea to lose 20lbs for my sister’s wedding.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“It looks like I got jawline filler but really, I lost 60lbs and got in the best shape of my life,” she told NeedToKnow. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jam Press/@actuallyal__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It has without a doubt been the best decision for both my health and confidence,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salomon doesn’t view her slimmed-down face as a bad thing — if anything, she looks at it as a healthy change because she now thinks her once round face was a sign of inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She made sure to mention that although Semaglutide changed her life — it did come with some work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is not an easy solution and is not a magic trick. I started to eat so much protein and switch up my workouts,” she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salomon said she is no longer on the medication but is still working hard to keep herself healthy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The 20-something-year-old is thrilled with how she looks. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jam Press/@actuallyal__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“…I am no longer on medication, and am maintaining my weight!”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Aside from the Ozempic face change, another alarming side effect from the weight loss drug is “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/health/ozempic-teeth-the-latest-alarming-side-effect-of-weight-loss-drugs/"&gt;Ozempic teeth&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those who use the GLP 1 might have experienced dental issues — such as dry mouth, bad breath and gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ozempic might reduce saliva production, diminishing the mouth’s natural ability to cleanse teeth” — which can cause serious damage to one’s teeth,” Dr. Michele Green &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14731943/doctors-warn-Ozempic-teeth-effect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told the Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Saliva is crucial for protecting teeth, as it helps remove food particles, neutralizes acids produced by bacteria in the mouth and provides essential minerals that strengthen tooth enamel,” the expert said.&lt;/p&gt;

The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts have been &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md#global-overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;closely watching&lt;/a&gt; the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a "significant increase" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While authorities in Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202505/15/P2025051500748.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities in Taiwan have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov.tw/Bulletin/Detail/r632O45d10BEHKwQhQVm8w?typeid=9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"A more predictable pattern"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX8rfa_f5o0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/food-and-drug-administration/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;'s outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/covid-19-vaccine/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for the coming fall and winter seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines from &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-fall-2024-fda/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;last season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries," Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer," Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain — a variant called XFC — has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past season only saw an evolutionary "drift" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future," the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates of COVID-19 have now fallen back to low levels nationwide, measured through &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/activity-levels.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_3-emergency-department-visits-for-viral-respiratory-illness" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-nationaltrend.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;wastewater testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think after five years now, we are seeing very distinct patterns that [are] falling into a more predictable pattern," Thornburg said, citing a "seasonality analysis" that the agency has been working on about the virus. &lt;/p&gt;

(CREDIT: CC BY-SA 4.0)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(23" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cell Metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;00374-1) has found that cutting back on a single amino acid—isoleucine—can slow aging and help mice live longer. This surprising finding has caught the attention of scientists, raising hopes that similar dietary tweaks could one day boost human health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isoleucine, a type of branched-chain amino acid, helps the body build proteins. But there's a catch—it can't be made internally. Instead, it comes from foods like eggs, meat, dairy, and soy. While essential, too much of it might do more harm than good, especially over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies had already hinted at a link between isoleucine and body weight. Data collected from a 2016–2017 health survey in Wisconsin showed that people with higher BMIs tended to eat more isoleucine. That clue led researchers to take a closer look at how this amino acid affects the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different components of your diet have value and impact beyond their function as a calorie,” said Dudley Lamming, a metabolism expert from the &lt;a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of Wisconsin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; who is involved in both studies. “We've been digging in on one component that many people may be eating too much of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Study graphical abstract: Low-protein diets promote health and longevity in diverse species. (CREDIT: Cell Metabolism)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting findings is that reducing isoleucine doesn’t just add years to life—it also improves “healthspan,” or the number of years lived in good health. Even older mice benefitted when the change was made later in life. That offers real hope for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/common-hypertension-drug-slows-down-aging-and-can-increase-lifespan-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aging humans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;aging humans&lt;/a&gt; looking for new ways to stay healthier, longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their theory, scientists used mice with diverse genetic backgrounds and divided them into three groups. One group followed a standard diet with all 20 amino acids. The second had their intake of all &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/discoveries/all-life-on-earth-originated-from-a-single-common-ancestor-millions-of-years-ago/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amino acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt; reduced by two-thirds. The third group had only isoleucine reduced by the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All mice were free to eat as much as they wanted, but only from their assigned diets. Despite eating freely, those with less isoleucine aged more slowly and showed better markers of health. That suggests it wasn’t about calories—it was about the specific nutrients consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study opens the door to new ways of thinking about nutrition and aging. With further research, scientists hope to see if cutting back on isoleucine can safely help humans live not just longer, but better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, restricting dietary isoleucine led to a host of positive effects on the mice's health and longevity. It increased their lifespan, improved their overall healthspan, reduced frailty, and promoted leanness and glycemic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male mice experienced a remarkable &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-senolytic-drugs-could-extend-human-lifespans-by-30/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:33 percent increase in lifespan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;33 percent increase in lifespan&lt;/a&gt; compared to their counterparts whose isoleucine intake was not restricted, while female mice enjoyed a 7 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice exhibited significant improvements across 26 health measures, including enhanced muscle strength, endurance, better blood sugar control, improved tail function, and reduced hair loss. Notably, male mice in the low isoleucine group demonstrated less age-related prostate enlargement and a reduced likelihood of developing cancerous tumors—a common occurrence in diverse mouse strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unexpected twist in the study was that the mice with restricted isoleucine consumption actually consumed more calories than their counterparts. Despite the increased caloric intake, they managed to burn more energy and maintain &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-genetic-variant-which-could-prevent-obesity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leaner body weights;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;leaner body weights&lt;/a&gt;, even though their physical activity levels remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Low Isoleucine Reduces Cancer Prevalence in Males. Compared to mice fed a normal diet (Control), cancer prevalence was reduced by about 25% in male (left) mice fed a low isoleucine diet (Low Ile). However, this did not occur in females (right). (CREDIT: Cell Metabolism)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research extend beyond the world of mice, raising the tantalizing prospect of similar &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-why-intermittent-fasting-has-anti-aging-effects/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-aging effects in humans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-aging effects in humans&lt;/a&gt;. However, as with all studies involving mice, there are significant challenges to overcome before translating these findings into practical human applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet is a complex chemical reaction within the body, and it is likely that other dietary components play crucial roles in achieving the observed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General protein restriction, for instance, has been shown to have detrimental effects on both mice and humans. Therefore, applying these findings to the real world is more intricate than merely reducing the consumption of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/higher-protein-intake-while-dieting-leads-to-healthier-eating/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-protein foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-protein foods&lt;/a&gt;, despite its simplicity in limiting isoleucine intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlight that the amino acid restriction level remained constant in all experiments. They acknowledge that further fine-tuning may be necessary to optimize the effects across different strains of mice and genders, emphasizing that when it comes to diet, one size does not fit all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse collapsed"&gt;Low Isoleucine Reduces Frailty. Compared to mice fed a normal diet (Control), mice fed a low isoleucine (Low Ile) or low protein (Low AA) diet scored lower on the frailty index (FI), suggesting reduced frailty. For males this occurred at 24, 28, and 30 months of age. For females this occurred at 24 months of age. For 22-month-old females, the Low Ile, but not Low AA group had a lower FI score than the Control group. (CREDIT: Cell Metabolism)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dudley Lamming underscores the complexity of the issue, stating, "We can't just switch everyone to a low-isoleucine diet."

This surprising finding has caught the attention of scientists, raising hopes that similar dietary tweaks could one day boost human health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isoleucine, a type of branched-chain amino acid, helps the body build proteins. But there's a catch—it can't be made internally. Instead, it comes from foods like eggs, meat, dairy, and soy. While essential, too much of it might do more harm than good, especially over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies had already hinted at a link between isoleucine and body weight. Data collected from a 2016–2017 health survey in Wisconsin showed that people with higher BMIs tended to eat more isoleucine. That clue led researchers to take a closer look at how this amino acid affects the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different components of your diet have value and impact beyond their function as a calorie,” said Dudley Lamming, a metabolism expert from the &lt;a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; who is involved in both studies. “We've been digging in on one component that many people may be eating too much of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Study graphical abstract: Low-protein diets promote health and longevity in diverse species. (CREDIT: Cell Metabolism) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting findings is that reducing isoleucine doesn’t just add years to life—it also improves “healthspan,” or the number of years lived in good health. Even older mice benefitted when the change was made later in life. That offers real hope for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/common-hypertension-drug-slows-down-aging-and-can-increase-lifespan-study-finds/"&gt;aging humans&lt;/a&gt; looking for new ways to stay healthier, longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their theory, scientists used mice with diverse genetic backgrounds and divided them into three groups. One group followed a standard diet with all 20 amino acids. The second had their intake of all &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/discoveries/all-life-on-earth-originated-from-a-single-common-ancestor-millions-of-years-ago/"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt; reduced by two-thirds. The third group had only isoleucine reduced by the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All mice were free to eat as much as they wanted, but only from their assigned diets. Despite eating freely, those with less isoleucine aged more slowly and showed better markers of health. That suggests it wasn’t about calories—it was about the specific nutrients consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study opens the door to new ways of thinking about nutrition and aging. With further research, scientists hope to see if cutting back on isoleucine can safely help humans live not just longer, but better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, restricting dietary isoleucine led to a host of positive effects on the mice's health and longevity. It increased their lifespan, improved their overall healthspan, reduced frailty, and promoted leanness and glycemic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male mice experienced a remarkable &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-senolytic-drugs-could-extend-human-lifespans-by-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;33 percent increase in lifespan&lt;/a&gt; compared to their counterparts whose isoleucine intake was not restricted, while female mice enjoyed a 7 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice exhibited significant improvements across 26 health measures, including enhanced muscle strength, endurance, better blood sugar control, improved tail function, and reduced hair loss. Notably, male mice in the low isoleucine group demonstrated less age-related prostate enlargement and a reduced likelihood of developing cancerous tumors—a common occurrence in diverse mouse strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unexpected twist in the study was that the mice with restricted isoleucine consumption actually consumed more calories than their counterparts. Despite the increased caloric intake, they managed to burn more energy and maintain &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-genetic-variant-which-could-prevent-obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;leaner body weights&lt;/a&gt;, even though their physical activity levels remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Low Isoleucine Reduces Cancer Prevalence in Males. Compared to mice fed a normal diet (Control), cancer prevalence was reduced by about 25% in male (left) mice fed a low isoleucine diet (Low Ile). However, this did not occur in females (right).

However, as with all studies involving mice, there are significant challenges to overcome before translating these findings into practical human applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet is a complex chemical reaction within the body, and it is likely that other dietary components play crucial roles in achieving the observed results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;General protein restriction, for instance, has been shown to have detrimental effects on both mice and humans. Therefore, applying these findings to the real world is more intricate than merely reducing the consumption of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/higher-protein-intake-while-dieting-leads-to-healthier-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high-protein foods&lt;/a&gt;, despite its simplicity in limiting isoleucine intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlight that the amino acid restriction level remained constant in all experiments. They acknowledge that further fine-tuning may be necessary to optimize the effects across different strains of mice and genders, emphasizing that when it comes to diet, one size does not fit all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Low Isoleucine Reduces Frailty. Compared to mice fed a normal diet (Control), mice fed a low isoleucine (Low Ile) or low protein (Low AA) diet scored lower on the frailty index (FI), suggesting reduced frailty. For males this occurred at 24, 28, and 30 months of age. For females this occurred at 24 months of age. For 22-month-old females, the Low Ile, but not Low AA group had a lower FI score than the Control group.

		&lt;p&gt;A measles outbreak with its highest number of cases clustered in West Texas and New Mexico since the surge began in January is spilling into South and Central Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) confirmed a case of measles in Atascosa County, just south of San Antonio, on April 21, that was determined to be linked to the West Texas outbreak. The exposure was centered west of Poteet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, another case in Kyle was confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a population of about 63,000, Kyle is located in Hays County on the Interstate 35 corridor between San Marcos and Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cases are the closest San Antonio has come to a brush with the highly infectious disease since health authorities &lt;a href="https://sanantonioreport.org/west-texan-tests-positive-for-measles-after-visiting-utsa-river-walk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;warned in late February&lt;/a&gt; that a West Texas resident diagnosed with measles spent a weekend visit in San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Bowling, an infectious disease specialist and chief epidemiologist at University Health, said that while he is glad there has not been a case in Bexar County, it wouldn’t take much given the outbreaks nationwide and how contagious the pathogen really is — many times more than the COVID-19 virus, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, there are 1,024 confirmed measles cases so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thirty states have reported measles cases — that’s really high,” he said. “And globally, measles is higher right now, too. So that is concerning to me, that even though this measles case outbreak in Texas seems to be trickling down … it’s still worrisome that there are this many states involved, and most of these are imported cases,” originating from other areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anytime you have a case, there’s the risk that you’re going to have an intersection with a pocket of people or community that’s under-vaccinated, and you can have another flare-up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause &lt;a href="https://sanantonioreport.org/if-you-live-in-texas-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-recent-measles-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;life-threatening illness&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who is not protected against the virus. It is characterized by a flat red rash, and like other common respiratory illnesses, is accompanied by cough and congestion, watery eyes and fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a measles outbreak, about 1 in 5 people who get sick will need medical care and 1 in 20 will develop pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In children, measles can lead to ear infections and pneumonia. In about 1 in 1,000 cases, the measles virus can infect the brain and spinal cord and cause encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and result in coma and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two children in Texas have already died in the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials maintain that the safest and most effective way to prevent measles is through vaccination, which came into widespread use in the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the MMR vaccine, for measles, mumps and rubella, be administered at 12 to 15 months of age, with a second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent deadly measles outbreak in Texas appears to have driven an increase in the number of people who are vaccinated against measles, according to data from DSHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the data is incomplete because most people have not opted in to the Texas immunization registry, more than 320,000 people statewide have received the MMR vaccine since the start of the year versus over 277,000 in the first six months of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In West Texas where the outbreak is concentrated, that number doubled, from just over 7,500 to over 13,600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates in Atascosa County are among the highest in the state with 98.5% of kindergartners and 99% of seventh graders having received the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rates are slightly lower in Hays County, with 95% of kindergartners and 96% of seventh graders. Adult vaccination rates are not available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Antonio, health authorities are monitoring the outbreak, said a Metropolitan Health District spokeswoman, and continuing to educate the community about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, due to federal funding cuts, Metro Health &lt;a href="https://sanantonioreport.org/as-measles-spreads-federal-funding-cuts-force-metro-health-to-halt-vaccine-clinics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that free and low-cost vaccines soon will be a thing of the past at Metro Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the agency used a Federal Immunization Vaccines for Children Grant to assist 9,300 people and administer 22,400 vaccines. That comes to an end on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Texas, parents can opt out of vaccinations for their children if they claim a conscientious exemption by submitting an affidavit form to the child’s school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the DSHS shows that the highest percentage rates of conscientious exemptions in Bexar County are mostly filed via private schools, which also have lower student enrollment compared to public school districts.&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;
