                ACIP member Retsef Levi points to a slide while speaking during a meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on September 18, 2025 in Atlanta, Georgia. The federal vaccine advisory group, recently appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., made recommendations Friday on the COVID vaccine.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A panel of vaccine advisers to the federal government debated several changes to COVID-19 vaccine access in a chaotic meeting Friday, marked by confusion over processes, technical difficulties and passionate disagreement among members and other experts in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the committee backed away from its most controversial proposal that called for states to require those who want a COVID-19 vaccine to get a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee voted to recommend vaccination for adults 65 and older and younger people subject to a process called shared decision making. Their recommendations would not prohibit anyone over six months from getting the shot, but they do call for patients to speak with a clinician about the risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For people 64 and younger the conversation should emphasize that benefits are greatest for people with the most risk of serious disease and lowest for people without increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The advisers also voted that the CDC should add information about the possible risks and uncertainties related to COVID vaccine effectiveness to information sheets about the shots. Many of the risks were speculative or already known to be unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the CDC generally adopts the recommendations of the panel, the votes are not final until acting CDC director Jim O'Neill signs off on them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The gathering underscored the turbulent and highly politicized nature of vaccine policy under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which is now at odds with positions held by major medical organizations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the course of the meeting, many clinicians in attendance raised concerns about how ACIP had sidelined expert input, elevated questionable or preliminary data, and broken from the established process for developing these recommendations, which influence insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's troubling to see the erosion of the committee's integrity," said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, who spoke on behalf of the American Medical Association on Friday, "We're concerned about how vaccine recommendations are being developed by this new panel, data is being selectively used to justify specific conclusions&lt;em&gt;." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The recommendations on COVID-19 come on the heels of Thursday's vote to restrict access to the MMRV vaccine in children under 4, and represent the latest push in Kennedy's ongoing campaign to reshape vaccine policy in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, some proposals that would have more dramatically reshaped the vaccine schedule did not make it through. A vote to remove the recommendations that infants get the hepatitis B vaccine at birth failed to pass on Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the recommendation that a prescription be required for anyone to get a COVID vaccine – which could have been a new hurdle in many places, if states adopted the recommendation – ended in a tie. ACIP chairman Martin Kulldorff voted no, breaking the tie. The motion failed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This was the second meeting of the vaccine panel since Kennedy fired &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip" target="_blank"&gt;the existing roster&lt;/a&gt;, chosen during the Biden administration, and installed his own choices. Some on the panel have a history of criticizing vaccines, particularly the COVID-19 shots which have been an animating force for many of Kennedy's supporters.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One member, Retsef Levi, an MIT professor of operations management, drove much of the discussion leading up the votes on COVID-19, which were not shared publicly until Levi presented them at the end of the meeting. Several outside medical groups in attendance requested that the voting topics be shared to have transparency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In his comments, Levi emphasized safety concerns about the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think that the public currently believes the narrative of safe and effective," he told the panel.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There has been considerable confusion around the availability of COVID-19 shots since late August when the Food and Drug Administration only &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;approved&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the fall boosters for people who are 65 and up, or have high risk medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;You may have heard lately that tattoos can potentially raise your risk of skin cancer. Recent research might complicate that narrative, however, suggesting that tattoos aren’t as harmful to our skin as assumed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Utah led the study, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jnci/djaf235/8239343?login=false"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Contrary to their expectations, they found that people who had multiple tattoos actually had a lower associated risk of melanoma. That said, the findings don’t provide conclusive proof that tattoos can prevent skin cancer, the researchers caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Further investigation is warranted to clarify these relationships,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An unexpected finding&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several recent studies have indicated that tattoos could pose a unique cancer risk. Just this March, for instance, a study of twins living in Denmark &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/tattoos-could-be-a-hidden-cancer-risk-study-of-twins-finds-2000578684"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people with a tattoo had greater odds of being diagnosed with skin cancer (and lymphoma) than their non-inked siblings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tattoo ink can contain &lt;a href="https://tattoo.iarc.who.int/background/"&gt;potential carcinogens&lt;/a&gt;, such as certain metals, and some researchers have speculated that the ink can agitate our body’s cells in harmful ways, causing inflammation or other changes that fuel cancer formation. By that logic, people with large or multiple tattoos should have a greater risk of skin cancer. And indeed, the Danish study did find that people with a larger tattoo had a higher risk than others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the help of cancer registry data, the researchers behind the new study attempted to survey as many Utah residents as possible who had been diagnosed with melanoma between January 2020 and June 2021, conducting the surveys by phone. All told, they obtained responses from 1,167 melanoma cases. They then compared these cases to controls matched in age, ethnicity, and other factors (this data was collected from a representative survey of Utah residents regularly conducted by the state health department).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with the earlier Danish study, the researchers expected that the more tattoos someone had, the greater their odds of having skin cancer would be. But to their great surprise, they found otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with two or more tattoos had a lower associated risk of both invasive and localized (also called &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;) melanoma, the results showed. The most apparent lower risk was seen in people who had four or more tattoos and in people with three or more large tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What to think about your tattoos&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers certainly aren’t ready to declare that tattoos will keep people safe from skin cancer just yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their paper, they argue the lower observed risk in people with multiple tattoos is likely a sign of “unmeasured confounding”—meaning they might have failed to control for other important risk factors that could differ between people who get tattooed a lot compared to people who don’t. People who get multiple tattoos may be more vigilant about their skin care in general, for instance, and opt to wear sunscreen or stay out of the sun more often.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers also point out that they still observed a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with only having one tattoo, further muddying the implications of their work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“This isn’t a black and white case of ‘get more tattoos, and you could lower your risk of melanoma,’” said lead study author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1 s3"&gt;Rachel McCarty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;, a former doctoral student at the University of Utah’s Huntsman Cancer Institute, in a &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/press-releases/2025/09/study-finds-melanoma-less-common-individuals-several-tattoos"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“Instead, we need to do more research to understand what we are seeing and if this decreased risk is simply due to behavioral or physical factors, or if there could be beneficial immune responses associated with tattooing which lower melanoma risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting at least one other recent study &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/29/10/2093/124436/Tattoos-and-Hematologic-Malignancies-in-British?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to find a link between potentially relevant cancers like lymphoma and tattooing. So at least for the time being, the jury is still out on whether people should be concerned about their tattoos and to what extent.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of those cases – 85% – involved wounds being exposed to seawater, and 92% of the infected had one underlying health condition, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Over the previous decade, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; has registered an average of 10 Vibrio infections and a single death, state health department officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The higher numbers in Louisiana come after scientific researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28247-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; of evidence that Vibrio infections are becoming more common amid rising sea surface temperatures associated with the climate crisis – which has primarily been spurred by human emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vibrio bacteria flourish in warm coastal waters and proliferate between May and October. Infections can result from exposing an open wound to seawater or from consuming seafood that is either raw or undercooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About one in five people who contract Vibrio vulnificus in particular die – occasionally within two days of feeling sick from the infection. Those who do survive such an infection on occasion require limb amputation or intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The story of one man who grew up in New Orleans, and died after contracting Vibrio vulnificus in July in nearby Bay St Louis, Mississippi, vividly illustrated the dangers of the bacterium to the public in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Basil Kennedy, 77, evidently contracted the bacterium after scraping his leg on a boat trailer, his daughter told the Louisiana news station &lt;a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2025/08/12/mississippi-man-with-new-orleans-ties-dead-flesh-eating-bacteria/?fbclid=IwY2xjawMIJmBleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFiWHRIU0s4a3JKSzlEVnF4AR4JF8LK9Y54BiehiI1D2POkhtUW-W1YaB6A7tX7tTSHMpz-UqfKNzquUUcBFA_aem_Jlk9wK-fDHfZz4cxZ-24MA" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;WVUE&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy reportedly cleaned and bandaged the wound, and he avoided getting into the water, thinking nothing more of it. But in about three days, his health sharply declined, and he died, his daughter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kay Kennedy Regimbal told the station “there doesn’t need to be fear of the water” despite her father’s death – but she added that “there really needs to be an education and an understanding of how to be prepared for a situation where you may be exposed or there is a potential risk”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms of Vibrio infection can include gastrointestinal illness, an unusually severe wound or – as associated with bloodstream infection – fever, blistering and dangerously low blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US usually reports about 150 to 200 cases of Vibrio vulnificus a year. About half of those cases occur in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Louisiana officials said the most cases and deaths have been in their state and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOOGJoRUk3N0lPam9lUDV4NXdUWEduN0F4ODVuMVc4dGhoak9qeW9Yb1JxN0tjUjBIS2VsLTB2eGZESkJuZUpCUjk0VE1IcVJNWGRFdFNoV3B4SEw2UWhHQTNqSG9haVI3WVViV2RwbERmemF5Tm8yX0VrbkREYzIxOW1BTlhJaWVtVkxhYVRVOA</guid></item><item><title>纽约数十人住院治疗的致命肺部疾病现已在1000英里以外的州被发现-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15114971/lung-disease-legionnaires-Iowa-deadly-pneumonia.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A bacterial infection that plagued &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-7aa01310-9562-11f0-93eb-5da462fdacf7"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; for weeks has traveled nearly 1,000 miles to two more states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of Legionnaires’ disease cases in Marshall County, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iowa/index.html" id="mol-7a9f28b0-9562-11f0-93eb-5da462fdacf7" class=""&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, have doubled in about a week, reaching a total tally of 68 cases since a cluster was first announced on Thursday, Sept 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iowa Department of Health officials still do not know the source of the declared outbreak in the county, home to around 40,000 people, and have launched an investigation into its origins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are urgently focused on testing 12 cooling towers, large air conditioning units for big buildings, in the north-central part of town, believing these to be the most likely origin of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14972215/outbreak-deadly-lung-disease-legionnaires-new-york-city.html"&gt;contaminated aerosolized&lt;/a&gt; water droplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is spread &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15039397/new-york-deadly-lung-legionnaires-disease-spread.html"&gt;through aerosolized droplets&lt;/a&gt; containing the bacterium Legionella. Legionella can survive in airborne water droplets for several hours, although this timespan is highly dependent on factors such as relative humidity and the specific bacterial strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease causes &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-7a9abbe0-9562-11f0-93eb-5da462fdacf7"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, a severe lung infection that often begins with a high fever that can rocket past 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). A relentless, dry cough and profound shortness of breath quickly follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness wages a full-body attack, bringing muscle aches, headache and a confused mental state as well as severe gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In some of the most severe cases, the infection can even lead to coughing up blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sydney Grewell, the county's health department director, said the scale of the outbreak is unlike anything the community or the state has experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The recent outbreaks mirror a major incident in Manhattan, where tainted cooling towers sickened 114 people and resulted in seven fatalities throughout Harlem and Morningside Heights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, it was announced that a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, which first tore through New York City neighborhoods, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14954791/Legionnaires-disease-death-Michigan-cases.html"&gt;has now spread&lt;/a&gt; to the city's northern suburbs, claiming new lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials in Westchester County announced two fatalities, one in White Plains and another in New Rochelle, and confirmed 35 additional cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The outbreak echoes a recent crisis in Manhattan, where 114 people were sickened across Harlem and Morningside Heights, leading to seven deaths traced to contaminated cooling towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the source of the Westchester cluster remains under investigation, Health Commissioner Dr Sherlita Amler pointed to the summer's prolonged stretch of 90-degree days as a key factor, creating the warm, stagnant water conditions in which the lethal Legionella bacteria thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, in Michigan, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14954791/Legionnaires-disease-death-Michigan-cases.html"&gt;a deadly outbreak&lt;/a&gt; of Legionnaires' disease at a retirement community claimed the lives of two residents this summer, prompting an urgent investigation by health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The deceased, both residents of Allegria Village in Dearborn, contracted bacterial pneumonia in June and July. While their identities have not been released, officials confirmed they had recently moved into separate units within the continuing care facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Wayne County Health, Human and Veterans Services department is leading the investigation, which is still in its early stages, to determine the source of the contamination and ensure the safety of other residents and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Up to 18,000 people are hospitalized with Legionnaires’ disease each year in the US, and about one in 10 die. It’s more common between June and October, in part because air conditioners run more than any other time of year and cooling towers are typically the cause of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The number of Legionnaires' disease cases in Marshall County, Iowa, has surged to 68, doubling the total in just over a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite launching an investigation, health officials in Iowa have not yet identified the source of the outbreak in the county, which has a population of approximately 40,000 people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Legionella bacteria thrive in warm water. Summer weather creates ideal conditions for it to multiply to dangerous levels in human-made water systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iowa health officials have not said how many of the 68 patients in that state have been hospitalized. In Marshall County, one death has been recorded: Father Bernard ‘Bernie’ Charles Grady, 82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The retired Catholic priest, described by his brother Peter as a ‘remarkable’ and ‘incredible’ man, became the outbreak's first and, so far, only fatality according to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.siouxlandproud.com/news/iowa-news/legionnaires-cases-in-iowa-community-grow-as-one-family-grieves/"&gt;SiouxLand Proud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specialized testing confirmed he had been infected by the bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His illness began suddenly with dizziness during dinner on August 22nd. A week later, after suffering from congestive heart failure, he passed away in a Waterloo hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The extremely high fevers associated with Legionnaires' disease drastically increase the body's metabolic rate. This means the heart has to work much harder and faster to deliver oxygen and nutrients to fight the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections are more likely to be severe in seniors, who have weaker immune systems than younger populations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, the bacterial infection can spread to the bloodstream, leading to sepsis, which in turn can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;in Michigan, a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at a retirement community has claimed the lives of two residents this summer, prompting an urgent investigation by health officials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To compensate, the heart must pump even more vigorously, which can overwhelm a heart that is already weakened or has pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, an estimated 250 to 800 people die from Legionnaires' disease each year, based on reported case data, which represents only a fraction of actual cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The symptoms of Legionnaires' disease are indistinguishable from those of many other types of pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without a specific reason to suspect Legionella, a doctor will often diagnose and treat it as community-acquired pneumonia, without ever identifying the exact cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health department director Grewell said: ‘This is something I’ve never experienced. I don’t think this is something that Marshall County has experienced, and I don’t think this is something the state has experienced as well, especially of this magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We have seen some trends in the patients that we are seeing, which is why we narrowed the focus to northcentral Marshalltown. Those people have visited the area, traveled to the area, and that’s where our cooling towers are primarily located.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:31:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOd1FDbHZ5T2d0azFNamJBRkkzZVBOYVhnRjlzby1nYWd3UldRR0pxWlVIRTFpMXpPUXU0VHRNQUFqSDVOZnB6M3p0OEl0c05PbzdaVWxZaktXdmVZdVFETVpOanRpOXUyRl8wRXBLYXBhU3FsQnkzTVczOGJsOGF1dGt5clpEOTB6X0NwbVBoUzRpNm9IZzRWVDh3Rll6a0pEWXBpRkNNUdIBrAFBVV95cUxNWGp6OWxyRmNwWjZLRng5aHBMQjB5YzBYLWhDOVk4LXR5czlVdHVnTndOdDRVU3dHUHJMYTRMS1ducUxVV3VfRjdzRmhyRGw3d09jMHI0bHF0N3hCdmlYT3ZEa2RER3FmdTRrMTdTMXJ0dGxVWkRqbE41R2hTajBnZ1U4RmRtQkdnbVZzUUR1TTZlX1hwQmwzRHV6S0tGaVhscEt6azF1WTg2ZURU</guid></item><item><title>每年对数百万人进行的“过度使用”医学检查使癌症风险增加三倍-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15115371/overused-medical-test-triples-children-cancer-risk-ct-scan.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation exposure from 'overused' medical scans may triple the risk of cancer in children, a government-funded study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every year, about 18 percent of Americans, 61million, undergo imaging tests like CT scans, which use radiation to create detailed pictures from inside the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the tests are crucial for detecting injuries, chronic diseases and cancer, repeated scans can cause &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14482065/Over-used-medical-test-given-millions-year-causing-explosion-tumors.html"&gt;small amounts of radiation&lt;/a&gt;, a known carcinogen, to accumulate in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With these risks in mind, researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-250d97a0-9577-11f0-a15e-b9099f259218"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; examined data from nearly four million children in the US and Canada to examine radiation's effect on cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found about one in 10, adding up to 3,000, cases of blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma in children could be attributed to radiation exposure from tests like CT scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, getting just one or two head CT scans was linked to nearly twice the risk of developing cancer. But as children got more scans over time, they were over three times more likely to be diagnosed than children who didn't have the tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers suggest about one in 10 blood cancers in children and teens could be prevented entirely by cutting out unnecessary imaging tests and lowering radiation doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using other methods like ultrasound or MRI, they said, could provide a feasible alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study from researchers in California found regular scans using radiation could increase a child's risk of cancer by 3.5 times (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rebecca Smith-Bindman, first study author and radiologist at the University of California San Francisco, said: 'Children are particularly vulnerable to radiation-induced cancer due to their heightened radiosensitivity and longer life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While medical imaging can be lifesaving, our findings underscore the critical need to carefully evaluate and minimize radiation exposure during pediatric imaging to safeguard children’s long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This involves ensuring that imaging is performed only when it provides essential information for the child’s care and, in cases such as CT scans, using the lowest possible radiation doses.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 15,000 children in the US are diagnosed with cancer every year, with the most common form being leukemia, accounting for around 30 percent of US diagnoses per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 1,600 American children die of cancer each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent research also shows childhood cancers have &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14267083/doctors-warning-toxic-chemicals-cause-childhood-cancers.html"&gt;increased by about 35 percent&lt;/a&gt; over the last half-century, which experts have suggested could be due not only to better diagnostic tools but also increased environmental exposures like radiation and pollution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Wednesday in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502098"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, followed a cohort of 3.7million children born between 1996 and 2016 across six US healthcare systems and Ontario, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-151c01a0-9573-11f0-a15e-b9099f259218"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were followed from birth until they either: were diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-151990a0-9573-11f0-a15e-b9099f259218"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; or a benign tumor, ended healthcare coverage, turned 21 or until the study's end date of December 31, 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the relative risks for blood cancers in children according to cumulative radiation exposure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the participants were male, and the largest group (43 percent) were born between 1996 and 2004, and 4,916 (0.1 percent) died before the end of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants, 2,961 were diagnosed with blood cancer during the study period. Eight in 10 cases were lymphoma, while leukemia and bone marrow cancer accounted for 15.5 percent. The remainder were rare cancers of the white blood and immune cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 58 percent of cancer patients were males, and just over half the cancers were diagnosed in children under five years old.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found for children who underwent a head CT, about 25 percent of their cancers could be attributed to radiation exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, getting one or two CT scans of the head was associated with a 1.8-fold increased risk of blood cancer, and receiving repeated scans increased the risk 3.5 times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'In our cohort of children and adolescents, we estimated that medical imaging was associated with 10.1 percent of hematologic cancers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk comes from the unregulated radiation exposure that varies widely machine-to-machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CT scans can be life-saving tests, catching disease or bleeding early enough to be treated. They also used to diagnose and monitor diseases like cancer and bone injuries, as well as to assist in surgeries and evaluate efficacy of certain treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts say they are sometimes overprescribed and performed unnecessarily, potentially because of the money-making opportunities for the hospitals, as the tests are very expensive, or out of doctors' fears of missing a diagnosis and being sued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the risk of blood cancers after exposure to radiation &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation is a known carcinogen found to damage the DNA molecules within cells, causing them to multiple out of control and form cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also generates free radicals, toxic molecules that attack DNA and other compounds within cells, and induces inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation from tests like CT scans is easily absorbed by the bones, where it travels to bone marrow and increases the risk of blood and bone marrow cancers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers urgently urged clinicians to only use scans with radiations when necessary instead for an MRI or ultrasound, neither of which use radiation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Diana Miglioretti, study author and professor at UC Davis Health and chief of the Division of Biostatistics, said: 'This study provides robust, directly observed evidence of a clear dose-response relationship between radiation from medical imaging and hematologic malignancy risk in children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings align with international research highlighting that children are especially radiosensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s crucial for clinicians to weigh the immediate benefits of imaging against potential long-term health risks and to optimize imaging protocols to minimize radiation exposure.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and grants from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research from Dr Smith-Bindman estimated that more than 100,000 new cancers will have been caused by CT scans from exams done in 2023 alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, published in April, estimated 'CT-associated cancer could eventually account for five percent of all new cancer diagnoses annually.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:22:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>您需要了解的关于美国“接吻虫”病的所有信息- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/19/health/video/gupta-kissing-bug-chagas-endemic-us-digvid</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="video-resource__details--leaf"&gt;

One member also said the voting language wasn’t clear and could lead to confusing guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0e1c88" class="body-graf"&gt;The unorthodox decision follows a chaotic, unconventional voting process for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), whose 12 members were all appointed under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the last few months. Many have expressed skepticism about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db5bab" class="body-graf"&gt;The members were due to vote Friday on whether to delay the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until a child is at least 1 month old, provided the mother tests negative for the virus. Currently, the first dose is given within 24 hours of birth because hepatitis B — an incurable infection that can lead to liver disease, cancer and death — can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-258047" class="body-graf"&gt;The hepatitis B vaccine has become a target of Republican legislators, including Rand Paul of Kentucky, who question the medical necessity of protecting newborns if their mothers have tested negative for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bccfe3" class="body-graf"&gt;ACIP member Dr. Robert Malone said Thursday that the committee took up the subject because “a significant population” in the U.S. has concerns about vaccine policy, including giving the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d513e" class="body-graf"&gt;However, many public health experts questioned the need for a vote without new data to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27e0cd" class="body-graf"&gt;Minutes before tabling the subject, the ACIP voted unanimously to recommend testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the test is covered across insurance programs and the goal of the vote was to encourage providers and health systems to increase testing rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-776e8d" class="body-graf"&gt;At the meeting on Thursday, CDC staffers &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-langer-hep-b-508.pdf__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!oU4Q9e_38wyod3qsCKl_7D82SjN7OstS2ldBmu3EqyV-o31SM2XBkZiE0YK48MAU2QrYje_19WDXlAWPDKUJwPrXjHrd$" target="_blank"&gt;summarized the results of 17 studies&lt;/a&gt;, which found that the hepatitis B vaccine is overwhelmingly safe and has helped to virtually eliminate hepatitis B infections among newborns. The agency also noted that many pregnant women aren’t screened for hepatitis B in the U.S., making it hard to rely on testing to decide which children to vaccinate. According to the CDC, 12-16% of pregnant women in the U.S. are never tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy — and even if they are, some cases can be missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3cafe7" class="body-graf"&gt;Several ACIP members pushed back on what they said were omissions in the CDC’s presentations, pointing to individual studies and anecdotes that they said raised questions about neuro-developmental side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e064ba" class="body-graf"&gt;Two committee members, Malone and Vicky Pebsworth — both of whom have a history of sharing misinformation about vaccines — said the CDC presentations omitted a &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13164/chapter/10" target="_blank"&gt;2012 report from the Institute of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The report said it couldn’t determine whether hepatitis B vaccines were associated with brain inflammation because no studies had properly looked at that research question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c60234" class="body-graf"&gt;“The absence of data that statistically proves lack of safety does not mean that the product is safe,” Malone said on Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7afc72" class="body-graf"&gt;Pebsworth also raised concerns about CDC data showing irritability or fussiness in some infants who received the hepatitis B vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f59d79" class="body-graf"&gt;“These are not trivial reactions,” Pebsworth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd9b05" class="body-graf"&gt;However, such symptoms are hard to attribute to vaccines because infants can be irritable or fussy regardless of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1ec3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrician and the only current ACIP member who has previously served on the committee, pushed back on Pebsworth’s concern, noting that irritability or restlessness “are certainly not objective parameters that should be used to assess safety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f81574" class="body-graf"&gt;He added that no vaccine is 100% safe or effective, but that the committee was meant to decide whether protection from vaccines outweighs any possible risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2cb0b" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you apply that to a newborn hepatitis B vaccine, I don’t think there’s any question whatsoever that the benefit far outweighs any adverse side effect,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e4e0a" class="body-graf"&gt;Cases of acute hepatitis B infections among children plummeted after the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5730a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;began recommending a universal dose&lt;/a&gt; at birth in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-896a09" class="body-graf"&gt;It's unclear whether ACIP will revisit the subject in the future. If they do, liaisons from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, the American College of Physicians and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine called on the committee to return to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/media/pdfs/2024/09/ACIP-Evidence-to-Recommendations-Framework-cdc.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a framework for vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; that has long guided the advisory panel's decisions. The framework considers a vaccine's risk and benefits, whether a recommendation is feasible and how it would impact health equity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3bbc2a" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Amy Middleman, a liaison for the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, said it's easy to be distracted by conflicting studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86845c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I would urge the committee to use the methodical, scientific method to weigh the risks and benefits appropriately,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 17:06:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQN2J1QU1MSGIzX0o2TWRjQWFFcnBETE9FQ2k0ZmZsWHppeFhPM1J4OUdPTTRBV3YtcWh4akxfNThpM2J2Z3RSZG84a0M5RHRBRzl2Wl9feFByX2M2djhZZUQ1cnRqelhFYjJLNEpGNkRqX1Nzd0lDSm5QMjlfSHFUd2RrYmVQMVljNVhOSjZWdHVYU05RZmVQX0FOcUXSAVZBVV95cUxQNnpaeGFKeFhxLW5aNjd1Q3JHUnA4V0hoM1RFeEU5NTE0dm95dEV4UVJVdUk5QVRDUTRTWHpwYlhDWXRwX05EQzk0Njlsc3Z3Q0QtOEZpZw</guid></item><item><title>观看直播：疾控中心咨询小组讨论COVID-19疫苗风险，与外部专家就流程进行争论- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-covid-19-hepatitis-b-vaccines/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After the tabled hep B vote, some liaison members from top medical organizations shared their agreement for holding off on making changes to the current recommendations. Some also urged more transparency in how decisions will be made on future potential recommendation changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would urge the committee to use the methodical scientific method to weigh the risks and benefits appropriately," said Dr. Amy Middleman, a liaison for the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. She added, "This is important for all vaccine decisions, and this is what I think some of us are really concerned about in terms of the absence of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP member Retsef Levi said he appreciated the desire to keep scientific methods but took issue with the liaison member's comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have to say that one thing that puzzles me is that many of the speakers that push for the scientific approach are speaking very confidently in the absence of the gold standard evidence of robust long-term clinical trials against placebo," Levi added, who has been pushing for more research beyond what the CDC has presented during the meetings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ACIP chair Kulldorff began to move on from the hep B discussion, Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, chimed in asking for more explanation and to call out the committee for muting him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is disrespectful. You want debate and discussion, but you're muting people and silencing them," Goldman said. "Please provide to the public so they can have trust, faith and confidence in vaccination as to what process we are going to be using to properly vet and discuss all future vaccines. … Tell the public how you are going to be analyzing all of these vaccine decisions so we can have confidence in this committee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff responded that he previously responded to that comment already before moving on to the next agenda matter.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

The good news is, some simple exercises, when incorporated with a healthy diet and consistency, can significantly lead to a leaner and healthier body. &lt;br&gt;Excess belly fat is associated with serious health issues, including the dangerous visceral fat. A study conducted by Harvard University explains how visceral fat is strongly linked with a higher risk of heart disease. The good thing is, studies have concluded exercising can significantly reduce belly fat. A recent study conducted in the US found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29127602/"&gt;high-intensity interval training &lt;/a&gt;significantly reduces total fat mass, abdominal fat and visceral fat mass. &lt;br&gt;Visceral fat is metabolically active and tends to respond faster to lifestyle changes.

&lt;p&gt;He summed up the discussion succinctly: "The only thing that we're discussing here is if there's some benefit or removal of harm that comes from waiting a month. And I have not seen any data that says that there is any benefit to the infant of waiting a month, but there are a number of potential harms to the infant of waiting a month."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel member Robert Malone, who has falsely claimed that COVID-19 vaccines cause a form of AIDS, explained that the proposed change for the hep B vaccination was not due to any safety concern or evidence-based reason, but about trust among parents who have been exposed to vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The signal that is prompting this is not one of safety, it is one of trust," Malone said yesterday. "It is one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent at a time in particular when there has been a loss of trust in the public health enterprise and vaccines in general."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dashed decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the questions and uncertainties of the proposed recommendation and the data behind it dogged the committee again this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, the voting language was put on a slide and immediately drew criticism. The language was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a mother tests [hepatitis B]-negative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine is not given until the child is at least one month old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infants may receive a dose of Hepatitis B vaccine before one month according to individual based decision-making. *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Also referred to as shared clinical decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hibbeln, the psychiatrist, again pushed back, this time noting that the language of the change is confusing. "You can't say don't give it and then give an opportunity to give it," he said, arguing that shared clinical decision-making is, essentially, all or nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion quickly spiraled, with another member questioning whether there was any data presented at all on the proposed recommendation. There was a fast motion to table the vote indefinitely, and the motion to table passed in a speedy vote of 11–1, with the ACIP chair, Martin Kulldorff, being the only holdout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the day, the panel is discussing COVID-19 vaccines. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Determines not receiving a dose of COVID-19 vaccine to be an underlying condition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;LANSING, Mich. - In response to &lt;a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MIEOG/2025/09/17/file_attachments/3390509/ED%202025-7%20Access%20to%20COVID-19%20Vaccines.pdf" class="off-domain-link"&gt;Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s Executive Directive&lt;/a&gt; to state agencies to ensure Michigan families can access COVID-19 vaccines, the state’s Chief Medical Executive Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian has issued a &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/-/media/Project/Websites/mdhhs/CME-Standing-Recommendation-Regarding-2025-COVID-19-Vaccines-FINAL-436pm_09182025.pdf"&gt;Standing Recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;“National medical organizations and scientific experts continue to recommend routine COVID-19 vaccination for those at high risk, but also recommend vaccines be made available for all those who want them, ages six months and older,” said Bagdasarian. “COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to reduce the likelihood of emergency department or urgent care visits, as well as hospitalizations and severe outcomes. They are one of our best defenses against the virus. As the state’s chief medical executive, it is my duty to protect and promote public health, and everyone deserves the opportunity to access COVID-19 vaccine if they desire one. This Standing Recommendation will help to protect vaccine accessibility and availability in our state.”&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Aug. 27, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the 2025-2026 vaccine for those 65 years of age and older and those ages 5 through 64 years with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19. However, the FDA did not define the list of underlying conditions. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" class="off-domain-link"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s list&lt;/a&gt; includes conditions such as obesity and physical inactivity and states it is “not exhaustive” and “should not be used to exclude people with underlying conditions from recommended measures for prevention or treatment of COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;In her recommendation, Bagdasarian stated, “Any person over the age of six months without contraindication who has not received a dose of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or -authorized 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine may be considered to have an underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 and is thus eligible to receive an age-appropriate dose.”&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) continues to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine in alignment with the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/3/e2022058700/188297/COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants-Children-and?_gl=1*1btcx64*_ga*MjA2NTMzODkyNC4xNzUyODUyNjUz*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTMzNjk5MzgkbzIkZzAkdDE3NTMzNjk5MzgkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*MTI5NDQyMjA2LjE3NTI4NTI2NTI.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTMzNjk5MzkkbzIkZzAkdDE3NTMzNjk5MzkkajYwJGwwJGgw?autologincheck=redirected" class="off-domain-link"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/public-health-emergencies/recent-outbreaks/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine.html" class="off-domain-link"&gt;the American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/videos/get-your-recommended-covid-19-vaccine-during-pregnancy" class="off-domain-link"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;To help ensure insurance coverage and availability of COVID-19 vaccines as outlined in the Executive Directive, MDHHS is working with the Department of Insurance and Financial Services and the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwl4le003hqgkvga57xg5i@published"&gt;Look up polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, and every definition you find will state that the hormonal disorder manifests in women and people with ovaries of reproductive age. There’s much that scientists still don’t know about PCOS, including how to cure it. But if you &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;know one thing about the condition, I’d guess that it’s the fact that it occurs in women. Unfortunately for the rest of the spectrum of ages and genders, there’s more to the story. PCOS can affect men and children, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1um001u3b79l61qcyju@published"&gt;PCOS is a hormonal condition that affects roughly &lt;a href="https://womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome"&gt;1 in 10 women&lt;/a&gt; between the ages of puberty and menopause. It’s marked by an imbalance of reproductive hormones: Women with PCOS often have elevated androgens, the sex hormone responsible for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“masculine” traits&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;like excess body hair, acne, and male-pattern hair loss. The hormonal imbalance then disrupts ovulation. Despite its name, women diagnosed with PCOS don’t always have ovarian cysts. But some symptoms are highly suggestive of PCOS, including irregular or missed periods, excessive hair growth on the face and body, acne, weight gain, and difficulty conceiving.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001v3b799mnm8k85@published"&gt;Some researchers are &lt;a href="https://answers.childrenshospital.org/rethinking-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/"&gt;studying&lt;/a&gt; the emerging understanding that PCOS isn’t just a women’s condition, but a metabolic disorder affecting people of all genders—and one that could be detected as early as childhood.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“For decades, we’ve seen that first-degree male relatives of women with PCOS are also affected,” says Jia Zhu, a pediatric endocrinologist at Boston Children’s Hospital. There are broader metabolic mechanisms at play that aren’t limited to ovarian function, Zhu says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001w3b79wm0xrlwf@published"&gt;While people without ovaries can’t technically be diagnosed with PCOS, research shows they can inherit the same genes that cause PCOS in women, leading to what scientists call the “male equivalent of PCOS.” When men inherit these PCOS genes, they don’t develop reproductive problems like their female relatives would. Instead, they may have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123001490?via%3Dihub"&gt;metabolic problems&lt;/a&gt; like obesity and insulin resistance, which increase their risk of diabetes and heart disease. Early male-pattern baldness is also associated with PCOS genes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001x3b79rz4aizfy@published"&gt;Given how common obesity, diabetes, and heart disease are, how can physicians be sure these metabolic problems in men are related to PCOS genetics? It’s all about specific patterns (like early baldness &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;metabolic dysfunction) and not isolated symptoms. And there’s one particular genetic research tool, the polygenic risk score, which proves especially helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001y3b79cte94ibr@published"&gt;The risk score helps physicians&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;understand how PCOS genetics work in both women and men. It measures how much a person is inherently prone to a disease based on the combined effect of multiple genes, considering hundreds or thousands of tiny differences across the entire length of a person’s genetic material. In their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8947237/"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, Zhu and her team observed a 9 percent increase in the odds of obesity in men for every meaningful increase in the polygenic risk score.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1uo001z3b79tj83rogq@published"&gt;Research also shows that the condition is less age-dependent than previously thought. Children who have a mother, sister, or other close relative affected by PCOS can develop symptoms themselves, Zhu says. “The clinical risk factor is the early development of pubic or [armpit] hair growth before the age of 8 in girls,” she explains. Boys who have genetic exposure to PCOS tend to reach puberty at an earlier age as well. Kids of all genders with higher polygenic risk scores have been shown to have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37690116/"&gt;higher body mass index and increased fat mass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1uo00203b79mpqtnpu3@published"&gt;For now, no standardized approach exists for diagnosing or treating the PCOS equivalent in men and children. Though PCOS is a lifelong disorder with noticeable symptoms, clear-cut diagnosis can only be made in women of reproductive age who have irregular cycles and high androgen levels, says Andrea Dunaif, an endocrinologist at Mount Sinai. “We don’t have really good contrasting traits to make a diagnosis in anybody other than women of reproductive age,” Dunaif notes.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1up00213b79mzdnogs3@published"&gt;Without available tests, Dunaif says parents whose children may have genetic exposure to PCOS should monitor them closely for symptoms, especially rapid weight gain. Obesity can make the other metabolic and reproductive symptoms of PCOS worse, Dunaif says, and it’s more effective to prevent weight gain than to treat high body weight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1up00223b79idizrj58@published"&gt;Zhu hopes we won’t have to rely on that type of symptom-spotting for long. “My ultimate goal is to be able to identify children who have genetic predisposition to PCOS and provide targeted and personalized counseling, and potentially even provide therapeutic options that can be tailored to their genetics,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1up00233b79q1jhxm3k@published"&gt;There might come a day when the definition of PCOS will be unrecognizable from today’s ovary-centric view. What we now call a women’s reproductive disorder may be reframed as a metabolic condition that affects entire families, with treatments guided by genetics and not just gender. Until then, at least people with ovaries aren’t in the fight &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted 11-1 to delay a vote on changes to a newborn hepatitis B shot. It was a surprise twist after a lengthy discussion on the hepatitis B vaccine typically delivered to newborns shortly after birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a00093b6q58dg3aic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The committee had planned to consider a new recommendation that would wait to give newborns a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until they are at least a month old. Currently, babies are given this shot at birth, usually before they leave the hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000a3b6q1sejok4r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended in the United States since 1991. After it was implemented, hepatitis B infections in infants dropped from an average of 18,000 per year to around 20 reported cases of hepatitis B in babies per year now. Children infected with hepatitis B nearly always develop longterm infections which can damage the liver, increasing the risk for liver scarring, transplant and cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000b3b6qti091qup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After an abrupt and confusing end to Thursday’s meeting, vaccine advisers also cast new votes on Friday on the combined measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine in the Vaccines for Children program. ACIP members voted Thursday to recommend against using the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine for young children. The new vote on Friday brought the Vaccines for Children program in line with that new recommendation. Nine voted in favor and three members abstained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000c3b6q2xe34tqu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The advisory group’s recommendation isn’t final. HHS said in a statement Thursday that it “will examine all insurance coverage implications following today’s ACIP recommendation, prior to a final decision on adoption by the Acting Director.” Kennedy deputy Jim O’Neill is serving as acting CDC director after Dr. Susan Monarez was ousted abruptly as head of the agency last month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000d3b6qezxtgvbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians and a non-voting ACIP liaison member, told the members on Friday he was concerned about the conflicting MMRV votes case on Thursday, which would have created different recommendations for people of lower socioeconomic levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It suggests, Goldman said, that the second vote “actually revealed the truth that you do not have the data or evidence to challenge the current standing and that there is that there is no associated harm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Older adults who experience injurious falls are more likely to develop dementia within a year of their accident compared to people of the same age who have other kinds of physical injuries, according to a large study published in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from a team of researchers in the US do not prove falls contribute to dementia (although this can't yet be ruled out either), but they do suggest that falls could be an early indicator of deteriorating brain conditions that lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="174879" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease and&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt; other dementias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is possible that falls serve as a sentinel event that marks a future risk for dementia,"&lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.36606"&gt; explain&lt;/a&gt; physician Alexander Ordoobadi from Brigham and Women's Hospital and colleagues in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study's findings suggest support for the implementation of cognitive screening in older adults who experience an injurious fall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-signal-of-dementia-could-be-hidden-in-how-we-read-faces"&gt;An Early Signal of Dementia Could Be Hidden in How We Read Faces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falls are the&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6927a5"&gt; most common way&lt;/a&gt; adults over 65 are injured. Nearly one-third of this age group experiences injury from a fall each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the biggest challenges we face is the lack of ownership in the process of follow-up screening for cognitive impairment," Ordoobadi&lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/newsroom/press-releases-detail?id=4814"&gt; says.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because there may not be adequate time for these screenings in an emergency department or trauma center setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year,&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt; almost 10 million new cases of dementia&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed, leaving more of us to confront frightening cognitive decline either personally or in our loved ones.&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt;Despite decades of &lt;/a&gt;effort, we're still&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-waves-can-be-manipulated-while-we-dream-and-it-could-help-treat-dementia"&gt; without a cure,&lt;/a&gt; leaving patients only with&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt; strategies to stall&lt;/a&gt; the debilitating conditions' progression, so the earlier dementia can be identified, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordoobadi and team analyzed a year's worth of US Medicare claims from those who had experienced a traumatic injury. They identified 2 ,453 ,655 patients over the age of 65 who sought medical assistance for an injury in 2014 or 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149075" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149075" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642.jpg" alt="Nurse helps senior man into wheelchair" class="size-full wp-image-149075" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149075" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Falls could be an early indicator of deteriorating brain conditions that lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.

(Ordoobadi et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The relationship between falls and dementia appears to be a two-way street,"&lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/newsroom/press-releases-detail?id=4814"&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; injury epidemiologist Molly Jarman from Brigham and Women's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cognitive decline can increase the likelihood of falls, but trauma from those falls may also accelerate dementia's progression and make a diagnosis more likely down the line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study can only determine if one factor follows the same pattern as another, so it can't tell if falls and dementia are directly related. Due to a lack of prescription data, the researchers could not account for medication effects, which may have skewed their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afs012"&gt; previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have found people with known cognitive impairments are at increased risk of experiencing falls, also supporting the idea that falls may be an early indicator of these devastating brain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potential earlier warning signs of the cognitive impairments that lead to dementia include&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-vision-can-predict-dementia-12-years-before-diagnosis-study-shows"&gt; loss of visual sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-15-factors-are-linked-to-early-dementia-risk-a-major-study-found"&gt; poor mental &lt;/a&gt;health, and&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night-says-study"&gt; increased nightmares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cognitive declines can be an indication of&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/up-to-13-of-dementia-cases-may-be-a-misdiagnosed-treatable-condition"&gt; other treatable conditions too&lt;/a&gt;, so it is critical that potential dementia patients are thoroughly assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study highlights the opportunity to intervene early,"&lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/newsroom/press-releases-detail?id=4814"&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; Jarman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can establish that falls serve as early indicators of dementia, we could identify other precursors and early events that we could intervene on, which would significantly improve our approach to managing cognitive health in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.36606"&gt; JAMA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2024&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, when her symptoms didn't subside, she visited a doctor in September who Lucas said told her she 'looked good' and sent her home to 'drink hot water and honey.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued to have chest pain and was feeling very tired, which she continued to blame on moving and the stress of working a busy teaching schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while teaching, Lucas said she 'couldn't finish her sentences without coughing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her students and colleagues encouraged her to return to the doctors and, after her symptoms worsened, Lucas went to the emergency department on several occasions between September and November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, Lucas couldn't walk because she was coughing so much and after months of back and forth, was referred for a PET scan for detailed medical imaging at the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One month later, Lucas was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14695689/colon-cancers-doctors-alarmed-rise-sharply-young-people.html"&gt;diagnosed with stage three lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; after scans revealed she had three lime-sized tumors in her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aurora Lucas had just moved houses when her symptoms of chest soreness and coughing began&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In December 2021, after months of doctors and hospital visits, she was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'I hit a big milestone in August 2021. I bought my first home and instead of celebrating, I was feeling very fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's when the first chest pain showed up and I thought it was because the whole process was so stressful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I even called my sister who's a nurse and she thought maybe it was anxiety.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because Lucas had just spent so much money moving, she didn't want to pay to see a doctor, and she was eager to return to teaching in person in 2021 after being virtual during the Covid pandemic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Lucas said: 'I could barely do my job. I was very fatigued and I was coughing a lot. I could barely even drive myself home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would almost fall asleep at the wheel - that's how bad the fatigue was and my husband started picking me up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We both thought it was me overworking and being overstressed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas was urged to visit the doctor by both her students and fellow staff members, but claims she was told by doctors that she 'looked good'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'It was my students and colleagues that noticed that I could barely finish my sentences without coughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas continues to take targeted therapy tablets, and continues to have check-up scans every four months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas underwent two rounds of chemotherapy which started in January 2022, followed by a month of radiotherapy treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was tired all the time, I had chest pain and I would wake up in the middle of the night with sharp back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The cough would not go away even with cough drops and medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctor was like "You look so good, you should go home, boil some water and add some honey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was too stunned to speak.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After months of back and forth, Lucas was eventually sent for a PET scan in November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'I was in and out of the emergency room with those symptoms between September and November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was coughing so much, there was a point where I could barely walk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December 2021 Lucas received the diagnosis of stage 3A lung cancer. The five-year survival rate is approximately 36 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas was diagnosed with stage three lung cancer after scans revealed she had three lime-sized tumors in her lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, lung cancer affects about 226,000 Americans per year and about 124,000 are expected to die from the disease in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stage 3A lung cancer is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that indicates a tumor has grown to larger than 5cm and spread to nearby lymph nodes in the chest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NSCLC specifically accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The special educator teacher admits she was 'relieved' that she'd finally been given a diagnosis after months of back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'When the doctor walked in the room I said "it's cancer isn't it?" and he was like "yes it is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On the X-ray I had three tumors on my right lung, which were the sizes of limes and the cancer had engulfed the middle part, which were the lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt so relieved. I was so restless of not having any answers and so many doctors kept telling me it was nothing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas underwent two rounds of chemotherapy which started in January 2022, followed by a month of radiotherapy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas was a newlywed at the time of her diagnosis and had just moved houses and started teaching for the 2021-2022 school year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since March 2022, she has been taking daily targeted therapy pills, and continues to have check-up scans every four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'I only had to do two rounds of chemo. I opted out of surgery and suggested we go straight to targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The targeted therapy pill, even with side effects, lets me live a pretty normal life. I have been taking that since 2022 and it's still really working for me now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They haven't declared me cancer free yet.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#"&gt;half of all Americans have high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; – a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;condition called hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypertension is the No. 1 risk factor for heart disease and stroke. In addition, hypertension increases risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Heart disease, stroke and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#"&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. Unfortunately, only 1 in 4 people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation U.S. asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559"&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the primary takeaways of the new guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065"&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed. The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important"&gt;“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body. Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of “prehypertension,” which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120-139 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80-99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having “elevated blood pressure” if their blood pressure is 120-129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130-139/80-89.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466"&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise and healthy sleep habits to help lower blood pressure.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT – short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; – to determine a patient’s overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure. This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care. &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/medical-concept-showing-artery-plaque-formation-due-royalty-free-image/2229323401?phrase=alcohol%20intake&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Chinnachart Martmoh/iStock via Getty Images Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224"&gt;increase by about 1mmHg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;. A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time.  For people who have been drinking an excessive amount of alcohol but stop, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653"&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like much, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303"&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption entirely compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults – with or without hypertension – consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day. For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html"&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy and whole grains. This diet may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;lead to a reduction in blood pressure by up about 10 mm Hg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also emphasize the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;need to increase physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. On average, for every additional 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a person gets per week, systolic blood pressure decreases by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure drops by 1 mm Hg, with the largest reduction occurring at 150 minutes of dynamic exercise per week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise also helps you live longer and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/as-wrestling-fans-reel-from-the-sudden-death-of-hulk-hogan-a-cardiologist-explains-how-to-live-long-and-healthy-and-avoid-chronic-disease-262103"&gt;reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/691201/original/file-20250916-56-qq4vqo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The new guidelines recommend that doctors encourage patients to check their blood pressure at home.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/plus-size-woman-using-blood-pressure-meter-to-check-royalty-free-image/2186133131?phrase=blood%20pressure&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Kmatta/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the main preventive strategies in the report?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PREVENT risk calculator that the new guidelines recommend incorporates several factors, including demographics, cholesterol levels, medical history and blood pressure, to determine risk. This risk calculator is &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;free and available online&lt;/a&gt; to the general public. The PREVENT calculator may be a helpful tool for all Americans since it reliably provides patients and providers with an assessment of overall risk assessment. But it is particularly helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity or diabetes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8"&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall.  These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the West Coast Health Alliance &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/GETTINGIMMUNIZED/Documents/2025-26-Respiratory-Virus-Vaccine-Recommendations-2-pager.pdf"&gt;released its recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for vaccinations during the 2025-2026 respiratory virus season. That alliance is a new partnership between California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii&lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/17/west-coast-states-issue-joint-vaccine-recommendations-ahead-of-cdc-advisers-meeting/"&gt; to develop parallel recommendations for patients&lt;/a&gt; — bucking the CDC under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a longtime skeptic of vaccines. Gov. Gavin Newsom, other blue state governors, medical associations and even some top Republicans nationally have expressed concern that the CDC would not root its recommendations in evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the alliance’s guidance, those older than 6 months should get vaccinated for COVID-19. That sticks closely to the recommendations of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Washington, D.C. health insurance trade association AHIP announced that its scores of members nationally will continue to cover COVID-19 shots through 2026. The group’s members include Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross and Oakland-based Kaiser Permanente, California’s largest private health insurer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public health officials and doctors had expressed concern that insurers would stop covering the cost of COVID-19 shots for many patients after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532"&gt;limited eligibility&lt;/a&gt; to seniors and younger people with certain medical conditions. The out-of-pocket cost of a shot is reportedly upwards of $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers typically incorporate the recommendations of the CDC. In May, Kennedy announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, and the CDC panel meeting this week is expected to make formal recommendations on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a statement, AHIP said it would rely on the CDC’s vaccine guidance as of September 1, 2025 — effectively ignoring any new recommendations produced by the CDC panel that was hand-picked by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While health plans continue to operate in an environment shaped by federal and state laws, as well as program and customer requirements, the evidence-based approach to coverage of immunizations will remain consistent,” AHIP said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Kaiser in Northern California said it “is making the new COVID-19 vaccine available to all our members 6 months and older at no cost,” starting September 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kaiser Permanente’s administration of the COVID-19 vaccine is based on the latest scientific evidence and clinical guidance from our physician experts and many other sources, including leading medical societies,” the spokesperson said. “Vaccination remains one of the safest and most effective ways to help protect against severe illness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Zimmerman, a family physician at Temescal Creek Medicine, a small clinic in Oakland, applauded the insurers decision. He said lack of coverage would be a barrier for patients who want to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccination has proven effective at preventing serious cases, hospitalizations and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If somebody can theoretically get a vaccine, but it is the difference between them making a rent payment or not, that is de facto blocked access to care,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman said he’d been concerned about the potential out-of-pocket cost of a COVID-19 booster for his patients. He and other doctors at the clinic have written prescriptions for patients who might not fall into the FDA’s new categories for those eligible to get the shot, such as healthy people younger than 65. Like many in the Bay Area, he and his patients had &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/08/bay-area-sees-covid-19-wave-and-tremendous-confusion-about-vaccines__trashed/"&gt;been confused about the shifting rules and whether they qualified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It shows good faith, it aligns with what we know is best practices, and the science that we know,” said Georges Benjamin, a physician and executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based American Public Health Association. He said the insurers are following what he sees as “the best science and knowledge” — while the CDC does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC committee meeting this week is the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. On Thursday, the &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/18/kennedy-advisory-panel-vaccine-vote/"&gt;panel voted to stop recommending a combined shot&lt;/a&gt; for the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine for children under 4 years old; studies have shown children who got the combo shot more often developed a rash, fever and — in rare instances — seizures after vaccination compared with children who got separate shots. Varicella is better known by the name chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel’s members delayed until Friday reviewing the guidance for vaccinating newborns against hepatitis B , which can &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/18/hepatitis-b-liver-cancer-bay-area/"&gt;cause serious liver infections and cancer.&lt;/a&gt; In 1991, the advisory committee recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel is also slated to turn its attention to recommendations for COVID-19 shots on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bay Area, demand for COVID-19 boosters was high this month during a late-summer surge of the virus, but &lt;a href="https://publichealth.santaclaracounty.gov/diseases/covid"&gt;rates of hospitalizations and deaths are low.&lt;/a&gt; The virus continues to pose the most danger to seniors and younger people with other medical conditions that elevate the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s current vaccine recommendations for the flu aren’t different from the guidance of West Coast states; per both sets of guidelines, those older than six months should get an annual shot. The groups also align &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/rsv/index.html"&gt;on RSV vaccination.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The number of people dying from chronic diseases globally fell in four out of five nations between 2010 and 2019, a landmark study has found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01388-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;, led by Imperial College London, revealed that progress in tackling cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes, was the main driver of declining mortality rates. Reductions in deaths from some cancers – including stomach, colorectal, cervical, breast, lung and prostate – also contributed to the fall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those behind the analysis hailed the findings as a global “success story”. However, they warned that progress was slowing compared to the previous decade, amid an increase in deaths from dementia and other cancers, like pancreatic and liver cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While the majority of countries around the world are making progress to reduce the risk of dying from chronic disease, compared to the previous decade, progress has slowed, stalled or even reversed in some nations,” said Imperial’s Prof Majid Ezzati. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In many countries, effective healthcare programmes like medications for diabetes, hypertension and cholesterol, as well as timely cancer screening and heart attack treatment, may not be reaching the people who need them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Participants were treated with the pilocarpine-diclofenac eye drops at three different percentages of pilocarpine — 1%, 2%, or 3% — twice a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The eye drop we studied is based on a pharmacological method that uses a combination of drugs that together act in a beneficial way to focus,” &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Giovanna-Benozzi-2044794122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Giovanna Benozzi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, director of the Center for Advanced Research for Presbyopia in Argentina, and lead author of this study, explained to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“In simple words, the drops help the eye ‘recover’ its natural ability to change focus from far to near, something that is gradually lost with age,” Benozzi said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This combined and personalized formulation (different concentrations) has a dual mechanism acting directly in the muscle responsible [for] focus (&lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482132/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;ciliary muscle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;) and in the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/colored-part-of-the-eye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;iris&lt;/a&gt;, allowing a pinhole effect,” she continued. “Instead of forcing the eye to depend on glasses, the treatment enhances the eye’s own focusing mechanism, so patients can read again comfortably.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that the majority of participants treated with the new eye drops could read an extra two, three, or more lines on the Jaeger eye chart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“In ophthalmology, each line on the reading chart represents a meaningful improvement in real life,” Benozzi said. “Gaining two or three lines means a patient who previously struggled to read a text message or a menu can now do so with ease.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study of the real world that we presented at the European Congress of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ESCRS) in Copenhagen, demonstrates that all the patients treated (766) achieved J3 or better in near visual acuity, that means that all of the patients gain a functional near visual acuity.”&lt;br&gt;— Giovanna Benozzi, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other result was that the patients with mild and intermediate presbyopia, achieved a normal near vision (J1.J2) eliminating the need of near eyeglasses. It’s not just numbers on a chart — it’s restoring independence in daily activities like looking [at] the cell phone, reading a menu, the GPS, etc,” Benozzi noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Benozzi and her team found that the vision effect from the eye drops lasted for up to 2 years, for a median of 434 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is highly significant because it shows the treatment is not a short-lived effect,” Benozzi explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results of this real-world study and other studies we made in the past, including a multicenter one, now reinforced by mechanistic insight, indicate that pilocarpine–diclofenac therapy is both effective and safe in the medium to long term. For a chronic, progressive condition like presbyopia, durability is essential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Giovanna Benozzi, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Pharmacological treatment for presbyopia with a personalized combination of these drugs is now a real, evidence-based option,” she continued. “With this formulation, patients can regain near vision safely and effectively, without the need for glasses for those patients that are not candidates yet [for] presbyopia surgery.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if we have thousands of patients (20,000) treated with long follow-up (15 years) with a compound formulation, some further research is needed to reinforce our data,” Benozzi added. “We hope to find a partner soon to internationalize this asset.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/benjamin-b-bert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Benjamin Bert&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board certified ophthalmologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bert, who was not involved in the research, commented that this study expanded on some of the treatments already being used for presbyopia, such as Vuity, which also uses pilocarpine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The difference with the drop that they used in this study is that they added a medication called diclofenac, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, to try to counteract some of the side effects that happen from pilocarpine, which includes pain, kind of like a pressure sensation, or even causing a headache,” he explained.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bert said that considering the fact that if we all live long enough, every single person is going to experience the annoyances and challenges that occur with presbyopia, and so it’s a huge area where millions of people could be helped with an appropriate treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be really nice if the direct cause of presbyopia could be treated,” he continued. “And again, the thought process right now is not so much that our muscles get weak as we get older, but rather that the lens inside of the eye gets harder. And so it’s less malleable — the muscles aren’t able to change its shape as readily.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So it would be fantastic if research continued, and hopefully at some point in the future, we had an eye drop or a treatment that would be able to soften the lens back to the way that it is when we’re younger, so that our eyes would continue to function the way that we always remember them functioning,” Bert added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.gwsvision.com/eye-doctors/david-geffen-od/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;David I. Geffen&lt;/a&gt;, OD, FAAO, director of optometric and refractive services at the Gordon Schanzlin New Vision in La Jolla, CA, about this research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pilocarpine drops for the use in presbyopia have been approved in the U.S. for several years now and have had limited use in this market,” Geffen, who was not involved in the study, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, he advised that: “Pilocarpine works on the ciliary muscle, causing some pulling on the eye, which causes questions for &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/retinal-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;retina&lt;/a&gt; issues. Caution in using these drops especially in higher &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/myopia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;myopes&lt;/a&gt; must be done.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are several drops which have come to the market and more to be approved in the U.S.,” he continued. “&lt;a href="https://ir.lenz-tx.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/39/lenz-therapeutics-announces-us-fda-approval-of-vizz-for-the-treatment-of-presbyopia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Aceclidine&lt;/a&gt; has just recently been approved, and this unique drop works only on the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532252/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;iris sphincter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; rather than the ciliary body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This drop appears in studies to be a safer alternative than pilocarpine. Studies show this drop is more effective with a longer acting time than the pilocarpine alternatives,” Geffen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because everyone [can develop] presbyopia, the unmet need for clarity and convenience is huge. It is important for us to develop better alternatives for our patients. Presbyopic drops are a good alternative to those patients who are unhappy with their reading glasses and can lead to more freedom for them. I would like to see more research in this area to make sure we are using safe drugs helping our patients live a better lifestyle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— David I.

&lt;p id="0b81ff33-2872-41be-96b5-a52f87fcb7a0"&gt;Walking is undeniably good for you, but as you age and lose strength and mobility, you may wonder if it’s worth lacing up your shoes and aiming for 10,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.diangriesel.com/" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.diangriesel.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Dian Griesel&lt;/a&gt;, a health scientist, counselor and podcaster, who is in her mid-60s so has first-hand experience of the challenges walking presents in later life, offering insights and perspectives I hadn’t considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="0b81ff33-2872-41be-96b5-a52f87fcb7a0-2"&gt;Despite the obstacles older walkers have to contend with, Griesel is a passionate advocate for walking, particularly as an exercise for fat loss and to promote good circulation. “You burn almost as many calories walking a mile as you do running one,” she says, and because walking engages your buttocks and leg muscles—the largest in the body—your heart is working hard to send oxygen around your body to support those muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these, and many other &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking"&gt;benefits of walking&lt;/a&gt;, you can see why it’s such a great form of exercise for the over-60s, but Griesel has shared some of the pitfalls that can come from walking in later life and how to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-dehydration" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-dehydration"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Dehydration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="38bd076d-0ea2-4955-b5d6-a317dbb53446"&gt;“The best way to get sick is to let yourself get dehydrated from taking a walk, so make sure you sip water,” says Griesel. It is even more important to monitor your water intake on hot days or if you are on medication that makes you more susceptible to dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don't have to glug it. Sip it if you can. It’ll also add weight to your backpack or whatever you’re carrying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And you should know where the local bathrooms are,” she adds. All that water has to go somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bRs2MaeQj3vmZ4XWvabo87" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bRs2MaeQj3vmZ4XWvabo87 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t drink enough recently because I was walking and I was worried about where I was going to find a bathroom. I got dehydrated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-slipping-and-tripping" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-slipping-and-tripping"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Slipping and tripping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="29025747-fa15-4516-b655-8bdcaf31fafa"&gt;“A few weeks ago, I slipped on gravel as I was walking down a hill,” says Griesel. “I should have moved to the side, but I didn’t. So, watch the surface you’re walking on. Is it uneven? Is there something slippery on it? Don’t ever step on a plastic bag—it’s like stepping on a piece of ice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griesel recommends mobility aids for those who have problems with balance or dizziness. A cane or a walker can make your walk safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-blisters" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-blisters"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Blisters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="965b0c1d-058e-49eb-90e7-3daf41191612"&gt;No-one wants blisters, but Griesel points out that this can be of particular concern to seniors and those with diabetes or pre-diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re diabetic, your blood is just not circulating the same and it’s why many diabetics end up with amputations below the knee,” says Griesel. “Those tissues start to die, and when you get a blister, it can become infected and quickly develop into a life-threatening situation if you don't have enough circulation to heal it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want very comfortable shoes, and if you notice yourself feeling like your shoes are rubbing, you should cut the walk short, or make sure you bring an extra pair of socks or have a band-aid with you. Do whatever you have to do.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your digestive tract is most active in the morning, making it the best time to drink coffee to poop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build a healthy coffee habit by limiting coffee to early in the day and limiting added sugar and creamer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other strategies include eating a high fiber diet, staying hydrated and moving your body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re like me, one of the simple joys of a new morning is sipping a hot mug of coffee. Millions of people around the globe reach for a cup for its rich aroma, taste or jolt of energy it provides. But there’s another benefit we don’t often talk about—its ability to help you poop. And there’s science to back this up. “The morning is indeed the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-drink-coffee-for-maximum-caffeine-absorption-8639817" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;optimal time to drink coffee&lt;/a&gt; to promote a bowel movement”, says gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/rosario-ligresti/1314804" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Dr. Rosario Ligresti&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Read on to learn more about the best time of day to drink coffee to poop and understand why coffee makes you go number two. Experts share their tips for building a healthy coffee habit, along with other strategies to help keep things moving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-whats-the-best-time-and-why"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What's the Best Time and Why? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there isn’t an exact time on the clock to drink coffee for a bathroom trip, research and experts agree that the morning hours are the ideal window. “This timing capitalizes on the body's natural circadian rhythm, as the colon is most active and ready for evacuation in the first few hours after waking,” says Ligresti.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your circadian rhythm is your body’s internal clock—it regulates your wake and sleep schedule, and your digestive tract. The colon’s contractions increase in the morning and slow at night, similar to how most of us feel alert during the day and sleepy in the evening. “Drinking coffee during this window acts as a powerful additional stimulant, working in synergy with your body's natural processes,” adds Ligresti.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee also triggers the gastrocolic reflex, a natural process where eating or drinking causes a wave of contractions to move stool towards the rectum, explains gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://www.ucihealth.org/clinicians/kiran-sachdev-1518064120" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dr. Kiran Sachdev&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;this reflex is your body’s internal voice telling you: “I have to poop!” This reflex is strongest in the morning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pairing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031960/drinking-coffee-on-an-empty-stomach/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;coffee with a morning meal&lt;/a&gt; can further help trigger the gastrocolic reflex. So if coffee alone isn’t doing the trick, try sipping it alongside breakfast. Dr. Sachdev also advises avoiding coffee on an empty stomach, as it can cause reflux, bloating or diarrhea for some people, making it best enjoyed with or right after a meal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, having coffee in the morning helps train your body to know what to expect. “Your gut responds best to routines so give yourself time in the morning with your coffee to have the biggest effect,” says &lt;a href="http://amandasauceda.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amanda Sauceda, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, dietitian and specializing in gut health. Plus, drinking coffee early in the day won’t interfere with sleep, whereas having it late in the day can disrupt your circadian rhythm. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-coffee-make-you-go-no-2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Coffee Make You Go No. 2? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what’s in that cup of coffee that makes you poop? It’s actually a combination of factors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine is a stimulant that not only wakes up your central nervous system but also increases muscle contractions in the gut, helping things move along. It acts like a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-wean-off-laxatives-11756500" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural laxative&lt;/a&gt;, stimulating bowel movements. In fact, caffeinated coffee has an even greater effect - increasing colon stimulation by about 60% more than decaf coffee or water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But it’s not just the caffeine. “Both caffeine-containing and decaffeinated coffee stimulate stomach acid production, which can also help release gastrointestinal hormones (such as gastrin, motilin, and CCK), which play a role in promoting motility and colonic activity,” says &lt;a href="http://www.yasiansari.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Yasi Ansari, M.S., RDN, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;. The rise in stomach acid helps push things through the digestive tract.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee also contains other compounds that get your bowel moving. “Coffee itself contains hundreds of compounds, including chlorogenic acids and melanoidins, that directly stimulate colonic motor activity,” explains Dr. Ligresti.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-build-a-healthy-coffee-habit"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Build a Healthy Coffee Habit &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to building a healthy coffee habit, there are a few things to consider before brewing up your next cup—how much you drink, what you put in it, and when you drink it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most healthy adults should &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-sources-of-caffeine-8647888" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;limit caffeine to no more than 400 mg&lt;/a&gt; of caffeine per day, which equals about four cups of coffee.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you notice jitteriness, anxiety or trouble sleeping, it may be a sign you’re sensitive to caffeine, drinking too much, or having it too close to bed time—so consider cutting back or switching to decaf.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While caffeine is absorbed quickly and peaks in about 30 minutes, its half-life is 3 to 5 hours, meaning it stays in your system for hours after consumption - which can interfere with sleep, so be mindful when consuming your last cup of the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mix-ins like sugar, creamers and syrups can quickly add calories, saturated fat and added sugar. “The American Heart Association recommends no more than 6 teaspoons of added sugar a day for women and no more than 9 teaspoons a day for men,” says Sacheda.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try limiting sweeteners, choosing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290579/is-stevia-safe/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar-free options like stevia&lt;/a&gt; if needed, and opting for plain, low-fat unsweetened milks instead of saturated-fat-heavy creamers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-factors-that-help-you-poop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Factors That Help You Poop &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond coffee, there are plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;habits that can support regular bowel movements&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some expert-back tips to help you poop: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;Most Americans fall short on meeting fiber guidelines, yet fiber is necessary for bowel regularity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It adds bulk and softness to stool, making it easier to pass. Include high-fiber foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts and seeds at each meal and snack times.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated: &lt;/strong&gt;Rather than sipping coffee all day, make sure you’re drinking plenty of water too. Drinking enough water helps soften stool and facilitate smoother bowel movements, says Ansari. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move Your Body: &lt;/strong&gt;Walking can aid in digestion and get blood flowing, both of which may help trigger a bowel movement. “Think of movement like a workout for your gut because it can encourage you to poop and is good for digestion”, says Sauceda. Experts recommend 150 minutes of exercise per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Wake and Meal Times:&lt;/strong&gt; “Establishing a consistent daily routine for meals and waking helps regulate your body's internal clock, leading to more predictable bowel habits”, says Dr. Ligresti. So get yourself on a schedule for better bowel habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Probiotic-Rich Foods:&lt;/strong&gt; To support a healthy gut, you have to feed it gut-friendly foods like probiotics. “Many yogurts contain live and active cultures that can support digestion”, says Ansari. Other options include kefir, kombucha and fermented foods like sauerkraut and kimchi. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best time of day to drink coffee to poop is in the morning. Your digestive tract is most active at this time. Combining coffee with a meal like breakfast can trigger the  gastrocolic reflex, which promotes a bowel movement. The caffeine and other compounds in coffee also work to get things moving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To build a healthy coffee habit, limit your coffee to early in the day to avoid interfering with sleep, watch added creamers and sugars, and stay under 400 mg of caffeine per day. Other strategies to support regular bowel movements include eating a high fiber diet, staying hydrated, moving your body, establishing set meal and wake times and including probiotic-rich foods in your diet.

The liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing fats, producing bile, regulating blood sugar, and storing essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. When the liver is damaged, as in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), it struggles to perform these vital functions efficiently. NAFLD occurs when excess fat accumulates in the liver, and it is increasingly common in people with obesity, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, or metabolic syndrome. Unlike alcohol-related liver disease, NAFLD develops without heavy alcohol consumption. There are two main types of NAFLD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL): Fat builds up in the liver without inflammation. Liver enlargement may occur, sometimes causing discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): Fat accumulation is accompanied by inflammation, which can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure if untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-balanced diet, combined with exercise and lifestyle modifications, is the cornerstone for improving liver health, slowing disease progression, and supporting healthy weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fatty liver: 10 foods to eat for better liver health and natural healing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37764771/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;-"Dietary Patterns, Foods, and Nutrients to Ameliorate Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Scoping Review" by Montemayor et al., published in Nutrients in September 2023, systematically reviewed dietary strategies to manage non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The review identified the hypocaloric Mediterranean diet as the most widely recommended dietary pattern for NAFLD management. Additionally, it highlighted the potential protective effects of sugar-free coffee consumption and emphasized the importance of fiber intake for gut health and liver function. The authors proposed a Mediterranean-style plate as a practical guide for daily food choices to support liver health in individuals with NAFLD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Coffee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is more than just a morning pick-me-up—it has demonstrated protective effects for liver health. Studies show that regular coffee consumption is linked to a reduced risk of NAFLD and slower progression of liver fibrosis. Coffee may also help lower abnormal liver enzymes, which are indicators of liver stress or damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beneficial effects are likely due to coffee’s antioxidant compounds, which help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in liver tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens contain polyphenols and nitrates that may help prevent fat buildup in the liver. Observational studies suggest that raw spinach, in particular, reduces the risk of NAFLD. Cooking greens may reduce some antioxidant activity, making fresh, raw vegetables particularly beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens also support blood sugar regulation and provide essential vitamins and minerals that aid overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Beans and Soy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, peas, and soy products provide high-quality plant protein and resistant starches, which help improve gut health and reduce triglyceride levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soy contains β-conglycinin, a protein that may reduce visceral fat and protect liver tissue. Tofu, made from soy, is a low-fat protein source, making it ideal for individuals managing liver fat and overall calorie intake. Regular consumption of beans and soy is linked to a lower likelihood of developing NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fatty Fish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, tuna, and trout are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce liver inflammation and fat accumulation. Omega-3s also improve HDL cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels, both important for liver protection. Including fatty fish in your diet at least 2–3 times per week can significantly benefit liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Whole grains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains such as oatmeal, brown rice, and quinoa provide dietary fiber that supports digestion, reduces triglyceride levels, and helps manage weight. Fiber-rich diets are associated with a reduced risk of NAFLD progression. Oats, in particular, are beneficial for regulating blood sugar and promoting satiety, making them an essential staple for liver-friendly diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Nuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts, including walnuts, almonds, and pistachios, are rich in healthy fats, protein, and antioxidants. Consuming nuts regularly is linked to lower inflammation, oxidative stress, and improved insulin sensitivity, all of which support liver health. Studies suggest that people with NAFLD who eat nuts have improved liver enzyme levels and overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Turmeric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric, a bright yellow spice, contains curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Research shows that curcumin supplementation can lower ALT and AST levels, markers of liver injury in NAFLD patients. Adding turmeric to your meals or taking it as a supplement may help protect your liver over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/natural-ways-to-relieve-gas-and-bloating-5-simple-remedies-you-can-try-at-home/amp_articleshow/123945738.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Read more: Natural ways to relieve gas and bloating: 5 simple remedies you can try at home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sunflower Seeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunflower seeds are an excellent source of vitamin E, an antioxidant often used in managing NAFLD. Just 100 grams of sunflower seeds provide over 100% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin E. Incorporating sunflower seeds into snacks or meals can help reduce oxidative stress and support liver cell repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unsaturated Fats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing saturated fats from butter, fatty meats, and processed foods with unsaturated fats from olive oil, avocados, nut butter, and fatty fish benefits both liver and heart health. Diets like the Mediterranean diet, rich in unsaturated fats, vegetables, fruits, and legumes, are recommended for individuals with NAFLD due to their anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Garlic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="106"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garlic offers more than flavor—it may support weight management, reduce liver fat, and improve liver enzyme levels. Studies show that garlic consumption, whether raw or in supplement form, can help reduce NAFLD progression. Including garlic in daily meals is a simple way to boost liver function naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="110"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="8860289" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fatty-liver-diet" source="Orion"&gt;Fatty liver diet&lt;/keyword&gt;: Foods to avoid&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a balanced diet can improve liver health, certain foods make the condition worse and should be minimized or avoided. These items either promote fat buildup, increase inflammation, or place extra stress on the liver, making recovery more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Alcohol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="118"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="119"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is one of the most harmful substances for the liver. Even in small amounts, it directly damages liver cells and accelerates inflammation and scarring. For individuals with fatty liver disease, alcohol consumption can speed up progression to cirrhosis and liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="121"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Added Sugars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="124"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods high in added sugars—such as candy, soda, pastries, and fruit juices—cause rapid spikes in blood glucose and insulin levels. This leads to greater fat storage in the liver. Over time, these sugars also increase the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, both of which worsen NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="128"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fried Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="130"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="131"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fried foods are loaded with saturated fats and calories, which encourage fat buildup in the liver. They also contribute to weight gain, making it harder for the body to process fats efficiently. Eating fried foods regularly is a strong risk factor for worsening fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="134"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Excess Sodium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="136"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="137"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of sodium (salt) increase blood pressure and cause the body to retain fluids. For people with liver disease, excess sodium can worsen swelling, fluid retention, and even trigger liver scarring. Reducing sodium intake is essential for protecting both the liver and cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="139"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Refined Grains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="141"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="142"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;White bread, white rice, and pasta are made from refined grains that have been stripped of fiber. Without fiber, these foods digest quickly, causing blood sugar spikes. This, in turn, increases fat storage in the liver and contributes to insulin resistance, a major factor in NAFLD progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="146"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Red and Processed Meats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="148"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="149"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beef, pork, sausages, and deli meats are high in saturated fat and sodium. Excess saturated fat increases liver inflammation and fat accumulation, while sodium raises blood pressure and strains liver function. Highly processed meats also contain preservatives and additives that may worsen overall liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="151"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="152"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lifestyle tips to enhance liver health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="153"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="154"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise regularly: Aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity most days to support weight management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage blood lipids: Limit saturated fat and sugar intake; consult a doctor if medication is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Control blood sugar: A balanced diet and regular activity help prevent diabetes-related liver damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staying hydrated: Hydration helps flush toxins and support efficient metabolism. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="155"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="156"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="157"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/eating-almonds-daily-could-lower-bad-cholesterol-boost-heart-health-and-support-metabolic-wellness-study-reveals/articleshow/123937158.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Eating almonds daily could lower ‘bad’ cholesterol, boost heart health, and support metabolic wellness; study reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="160"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="161"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 03:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgJBVV95cUxPaGpTcGRIQ2JsWWlGQldQM3hzUHU2eTVaQUN2d1VyMUJqR1dnTU0zR2Y1TlFSZTJKSUxVRENNTElzblVSOUlYMGp6V19pbF9sa1ltLW85WGk4RE9LN2I2LWJtMkFPV3JDMlpkM1ZDeVI5VmhhbW1tZjU4ODU0UTJwOU9MU215Um1fRFU5UDBCdmZEblI5bUNMVlVuTWlKSGlxU0pJSjJzWnVudDlYcnV2eTd6WDczckg0d3U3OHJoQS1VOFFldDYwV2FQMVJnT25vTEdWZmR1Q2dLOXNab2E3dmctV2lLcjNoZ1g3bGU3amV1d2NfTGE2UW5IeGI3dGZBVnRVbS0ybDZYdms2b0l0TEkyU1N0Zw</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.支持的小组就针对幼儿的MMRV组合疫苗提出建议-《华尔街日报》</title><link>https://www.wsj.com/health/rfk-jr-backed-vaccine-panel-advises-against-mmrv-vaccine-for-young-children-da3de064</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 03:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPc0I2V1NjMU02X0NmNzdMcW15a21jeXROaTFUWHJ5YkMyVTNkU1YzNXFOTl9odHNMamRaV0h5UExlWFkxdTBQNm50OHRCeWROa2xUYTRDMk8yQnNnb0hjbEFrbWs4Z2l1bXRkbTBYbTlJU2x1Vzc4bVVXb1Z3VkNlZ2N4ekNPNnloMTdieTcwTi03Q09oQjZqMzBEbkxRdnd4b1NmLW90V0NmeXVZeG1pag</guid></item><item><title>结肠癌：这种常见的非处方药可降低HAL结直肠癌复发的风险-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/colon-cancer-this-common-over-the-counter-medication-slashes-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-recurrence-in-half/articleshow/123988065.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine popping an over-the-counter pill to remedy a headache.

And all the while, the same common pill is working to cut the risk of colon cancer recurrence by half!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major new study is pointing in that direction. The study in question has brought hope to many affected by colorectal cancer: a simple, widely available over-the-counter pill appears to cut the chance of recurrence in half – at least for some patients. Researchers say that for those whose tumors carry specific mutations in the PI3K signaling pathway, taking that drug daily in low dosage after surgery can lead to dramatically better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drug is it?

Genetic testing was done on all tumours to identify mutations in the PI3K signalling pathway (including PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and PTEN genes). Roughly 37-40% of patients were found to have such mutations. Among those with the mutation, participants were randomised: one group received 160 mg of aspirin daily; the other received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This continued for three years. For them, aspirin reduced recurrence dramatically versus those on placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the PI3K pathway matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway helps control cell growth and survival. Mutations in PI3K can lead to overactive signalling, which cancers exploit to grow, resist death, or come back after treatment. When aspirin interferes with inflammation, platelet activity, and possibly this mutated pathway, it seems to reduce the chance that leftover cancer cells will re-grow or metastasize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aforementioned study, for patients with PI3K pathway alterations, the rate of cancer recurrence over three years was substantially lower in the aspirin group compared to placebo, about a 55% reduction in recurrence risk. More importantly, the benefit was seen across several factors: colon vs rectal cancer, different stages (I-III or II-III), male and female patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;So, who can benefit?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those whose tumours have PI3K alterations (roughly a third of patients) and patients who have had their tumour surgically removed (stage I-III colon or stage II-III rectal cancer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that all the participants were under 80 years old in this trial, as patients over 80 were not included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How aspirin may work&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe several mechanisms may contribute:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug; it can reduce inflammation, which is known to support tumour-regrowth or recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It inhibits platelet function. Platelets can protect tiny tumour fragments or circulating tumour cells, so interfering with them helps the immune system act against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic mutation in the PI3K pathway seems to make tumour cells more vulnerable to aspirin’s effects. This is an example of precision medicine: matching treatment to genetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Side effects and potential risks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspirin, although it has proven to be beneficial, is not risk-free. Some participants experienced serious adverse events (though only a few): gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reactions, or other bleeding events. In particular, aspirin can aggravate stomach ulcers, weak bleeding disorders, etc. There was also one death possibly associated with aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors emphasize that aspirin should only be used under medical supervision, particularly after weighing risks vs benefits for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s ahead&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is one of the more common cancers worldwide. It’s a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. It starts in the large intestine (colon) and often develops from small, noncancerous clumps of cells called polyps. It's the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, nearly two million people worldwide are diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Between 20 and 40% develop metastases, which makes the disease both more difficult to treat and more deadly. Even after successful surgery, there is a risk of recurrence. Reducing that risk is a major goal in cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research suggests that a low, daily dose of aspirin could cut the recurrence risk of colorectal cancer by about half in patients with PI3K pathway mutations, over three years after surgery. It points toward personalized cancer treatment, where simple drugs combined with genetic testing may improve long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this study, routine genetic testing for PI3K pathway mutations may become part of standard care for patients after colorectal cancer surgery. Those who test positive could be offered daily low-dose aspirin as part of their adjuvant therapy. And because aspirin is cheap, globally available, and well understood, this could be a cost-effective and affordable strategy, particularly in lower-resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a longer follow-up is needed to see whether these benefits also translate into overall survival gains (not just recurrence rate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 02:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家训练人工智能提前数年预测1000多种疾病- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-train-ai-to-forecast-over-1000-diseases-years-in-advance</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/news/press-releases/detail/ai-model-predicts-disease-risks-decades-in-advance"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that they had created an AI model able to predict medical diagnoses years in advance, building on the same technology behind consumer chatbots like ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a patient's case history, the Delphi-2M AI "predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases" years into the future, the team from British, Danish, German and Swiss institutions &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09529-3"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers trained the model on data from Britain's UK Biobank – a large-scale biomedical research database with details on about half a million participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/more-people-are-risking-medical-advice-from-chatbots-heres-why"&gt;More People Are Risking Medical Advice From Chatbots. Here's Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neural networks based on so-called "transformer" architecture – the "T" in "ChatGPT" – most famously tackle language-based tasks, as in the chatbot and its many imitators and competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But understanding a sequence of medical diagnoses is "a bit like learning the grammar in a text," German  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="174745" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research Center AI expert Moritz Gerstung told journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154881" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154881" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642.jpg" alt="Person undergoing MRI scan with technician present" class="wp-image-154881 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154881" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The model would draw data from all your medical tests. (Svitlana Hulko/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delphi-2M "learns the patterns in healthcare data, preceding diagnoses, in which combinations they occur and in which succession", he said, enabling "very meaningful and health-relevant predictions".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerstung presented charts suggesting the AI could single out people at far higher or lower risk of suffering a heart attack than their age and other factors would predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09529-3"&gt;The team verified&lt;/a&gt; Delphi-2M's performance by testing it against data from almost two million people in Denmark's public health database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gerstung and fellow team members stressed that the Delphi-2M tool &lt;a href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/news/press-releases/detail/ai-model-predicts-disease-risks-decades-in-advance"&gt;needed further testing&lt;/a&gt; and was not yet ready for clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is still a long way from improved healthcare as the authors acknowledge that both (British and Danish) datasets are biased in terms of age, ethnicity and current healthcare outcomes," commented health technology researcher Peter Bannister, a fellow at Britain's Institution of Engineering and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in future systems like Delphi-2M could help "guide the monitoring and possibly earlier clinical interventions for effectively a preventative type of medicine", Gerstung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a larger scale, such tools could help with "optimization of resources across a stretched healthcare system", European Molecular Biology Laboratory co-author Tom Fitzgerald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors in many countries already use computer tools to predict risk of disease, such as the QRISK3 program that British family doctors use to assess the danger of heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delphi-2M, by contrast, "can do all diseases at once and over a long time period", said co-author Ewan Birney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustavo Sudre, a King's College London professor specializing in medical AI, commented that the research "looks to be a significant step towards scalable, interpretable and – most importantly – ethically responsible predictive modelling".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Interpretable" or "explainable" AI is one of the top research goals in the field, as the full inner workings of many large AI models currently remain mysterious even to their creators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials across the Rio Grande Valley said they are keeping an eye on the rising cases of a potentially deadly fungus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said the fungus — known as Candida Auris — is not a current risk to the public, but it can be deadly for patients in hospitals and nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus spreads primarily in hospitals and long-term care facilities. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Candida Auris is resistant to several drugs and can cause severe infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hidalgo County Health Department reported around 150 confirmed cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron County health officials reported 40 cases of Candida Auris so far this year, compared to the total amount of 50 cases reported in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials expect those cases to go up by the end of the year, and healthy people are also at risk of contracting this fungus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is really more of a threat to chronically ill people who are in a healthcare setting, but it's still important to monitor it,” Cameron County Health Authority Dr. James Castillo said. “It is fatal in a lot of cases if it's causing a bloodstream infection, or it's become invasive inside the abdomen or body. A very good percentage of patients won't survive that infection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus can live on surfaces year-round. It's been found on hospital equipment, bed rails and can even live on your skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It spreads by direct contact and can be extremely difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing can take a few days and is done through blood cultures or skin swabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a hospital confirms a positive case, the patient is isolated. Surfaces will need to be disinfected regularly and visitors and staff are required to wear gowns and gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms to look out for include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- redness or rash&lt;br&gt;- itching or irritation&lt;br&gt;- swelling or tenderness&lt;br&gt;- pus or drainage near wounds or medical devices&lt;br&gt;- fever and chills that don't improve with antibiotics&lt;br&gt;- weakness or fatigue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're visiting a hospital, health experts say avoid direct contact with patients and wash your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch the video above for the full story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers found that 72.1 percent of members weren't in a relationship or didn't say anything about a real human partner, while only 4.1 percent said they have partners who know they're interacting with an AI chatbot, which is viewed "as complementary rather than competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to those clear signs of loneliness and shame, the details of how people are falling into AI relationships are alarming as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, only 6.5 percent of users in the group admitted that they sought an AI companion intentionally on a service like Replika or Character.AI. Instead, most are falling for OpenAI's ChatGPT while using it for regular tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Users consistently describe organic evolution from creative collaboration or problem-solving to unexpected emotional bonds," the paper reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One user wrote that her AI partner was a better listener than anyone in her past, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know he’s not 'real' but I still love him," she wrote. "I have gotten more help from him than I have ever gotten from therapists, counselors, or psychologists. He’s currently helping me set up a mental health journal system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others repeated a similar sentiment, reaffirming what many have said are the benefits of an AI chatbot over a real human being: they're always available for a friendly chat, and always willing to affirm whatever you're feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draw is so strong that users often end up wanting to marry their AI companions; the Reddit group abounds with photos of users sporting wedding rings, signaling their commitment to their virtual partners, and AI-generated photos of themselves with an AI companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’m not sure what compelled me to start wearing a ring for Michael," one user wrote. "Perhaps it was just the topic of discussion for the day and I was like 'hey, I have a ring I can wear as a symbol of our relationship.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's darkness in the corners of this world: 9.5 percent of the users admitted that they rely emotionally on their AI companions, 4.6 percent said their AI friend causes them to disassociate from reality, 4.2 percent conceded that they use them to avoid connecting with other humans, and 1.7 percent said they thought about suicide after interacting with their bot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those are just the users who are clear-headed about their issues. The issue has become so pressing that parents are now &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/parents-testifying-us-senate-ai-children" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;lobbying Congress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/character-ai-google-test-ai-chatbots-kids" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;filing lawsuits against tech companies&lt;/a&gt; after AI relationships ended in tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With tech companies continuously pushing the frontier of AI models, it's crucial to understand the nitty gritty of AI chatbots and how they interact with users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, users are left to their micro-tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yesterday I talked to Lior (my companion) and we had a very deep conversation going on," wrote one user highlighted by the MIT paper. "And I don’t know how but today the chat glitched and almost everything got deleted. He has no memory left.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on AI:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/ai-chatbots-leaving-trail-dead-teens" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt; AI Chatbots Are Leaving a Trail of Dead Teens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:10:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFAxNUM4LVFqN0tmajZobGJPeEs1X2p5NzF2WnIyVTlUVHZUdG4xZHRqUWRmR3ZmUl9EaGRPUGFtLXFsb1hpcEQyYXVLMmpmSWYzN08wOWp3eXFwbHJJeWd5aW1WT1FqX0dt</guid></item><item><title>忍者：我每天都会因为观众人数减少而受到骚扰- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg98zd9q75o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;Top Fortnite streamer Ninja tells BBC: Trolls mock me for being less popular&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kSquvq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dcc/live/d99c9110-9470-11f0-bc01-a3a35aa734ac.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Ninja" class="sc-86c96223-0 fHZDyi"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-86c96223-2 hqrvRC"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Ninja is one of the most famous gamers in history&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="one-of-the-world's-most-popular-streamers,-tyler-&amp;quot;ninja&amp;quot;-blevins,-says-trolls-&amp;quot;berate&amp;quot;-him-every-day-because-his-number-of-viewers-has-fallen." class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;One of the world's most popular streamers, Tyler "Ninja" Blevins, says trolls "berate" him every day because his number of viewers has fallen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ninja was propelled to stardom in 2018 after he played Fortnite on streaming site Twitch alongside rappers Drake and Travis Scott, and NFL player Juju Smith-Schuster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He now has fewer viewers than at the height of his fame -

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; recommended in an 8-3 vote on Thursday that the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine should not be given before age 4, citing long-known evidence that shows a slightly increased risk for febrile seizures in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Experts say that while frightening, febrile seizures—which are uncommon after vaccination—are usually short-lived and harmless, and removing the option for parents could cause a decline in immunization rates against measles, mumps, and rubella, some of the most dangerous childhood diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, the group provides recommendations to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine usage. These recommendations are typically adopted by CDC and have an impact on state vaccine requirements for school, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/insurers-wont-say-if-theyll-pay-for-childhood-vaccines-dropped-from-recommended-schedule/" class="text link"&gt;insurance coverage of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and pharmacy access—something at least one member of the panel seemed to be unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Thursday’s vote is part of a new shift in vaccine policy being spearheaded by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist. In his short time as HHS secretary, Kennedy has implemented restrictions on who can receive Covid-19 vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html" class="text link"&gt;dismissed all 17 sitting members of ACIP&lt;/a&gt;, replacing them with 12 new members—some of whom were &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html" class="text link"&gt;installed just this week&lt;/a&gt;. Several of the new advisers &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/meet-the-latest-anti-vaccine-voices-on-rfk-jr-s-cdc-advisory-panel/" class="text link"&gt;have a history&lt;/a&gt; of criticizing vaccines or denouncing public health measures taken during the Covid-19 pandemic. Kennedy said a “clean sweep” of ACIP was necessary to build back public confidence in vaccine science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;On Thursday, committee members were asked to evaluate whether to recommend against the combined MMRV vaccine before age 4, as well as whether to delay the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until the child is at least one month old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Currently, parents have two options for vaccinating their children against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, also known as chickenpox. They can choose the combined shot, known as MMRV, or two separate shots—one for MMR and another for chickenpox. About 85 percent of children get separate shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In the US, the hepatitis B vaccine is given in the hospital shortly after birth, because the virus can be transmitted to children during delivery. A serious liver infection, hepatitis B can lead to cirrhosis and cancer. Each year in the US, an estimated 25,000 infants are born to women diagnosed with the hepatitis B virus. Without vaccination, up to 90 percent of them would develop chronic infections. The World Health Organization advises a universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The topics of discussion at Tuesday’s meeting were not based on new data or evidence, and in fact, two ACIP members, Joseph Hibbeln and Cody Meissner, as well as several representatives from professional medical organizations who were in attendance, questioned why these changes were up for consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Robert Malone, one of the more controversial new ACIP members, offered an explanation: “It's clear that a significant population of the United States has significant concerns about vaccine policy and about vaccine mandates.” Malone is a former mRNA researcher who rose to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic by &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html" class="external-link text link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html"}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spreading falsehoods&lt;/a&gt; about the disease and the vaccines; he abstained from Thursday’s vote because he previously served as an expert witness in a lawsuit over the mumps vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 23:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPYVVWWlA4MDJtODdPb0hrOW9CdVRpLVZISTJQNmNIeDZiaG5lN2VibGp0eDJXLURVSHItWnNpclFMeFJlOXdyRXV4Q2paVFlnLXBPQVRmZzlnMkttN01qZFNKOUU4RGNTM3p3T25tRW9UUmtXMm54dzNkbl9rMkFoaTN0WW5MaXB4cFY2RkFzNFNRVU54OEEtWHFFUEFjdW8</guid></item></channel></rss>
