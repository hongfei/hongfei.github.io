Each bird follows simple rules of interaction with its closest neighbours, yet out of these local interactions emerges a complex, coordinated dance that can respond swiftly to predators and environmental changes. This same principle of emergence – where sophisticated behaviours arise not from central control but from the interactions themselves – appears across nature and human society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how market prices emerge from countless individual trading decisions, none of which alone contains the ‘right’ price. Each trader acts on partial information and personal strategies, yet their collective interaction produces a dynamic system that integrates information from across the globe. Human language evolves through a similar process of emergence. No individual or committee decides that ‘LOL’ should enter common usage or that the meaning of ‘cool’ should expand beyond temperature (even in French-speaking countries). Instead, these changes result from millions of daily linguistic interactions, with new patterns of speech bubbling up from the collective behaviour of speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples highlight a key characteristic of highly interconnected systems: the rich interplay of constituent parts generates properties that defy reductive analysis. This principle of emergence, evident across seemingly unrelated fields, provides a powerful lens for examining one of our era’s most elusive mysteries: how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea of emergence inspired me to develop the concept I call the &lt;em&gt;entangled brain&lt;/em&gt;: the need to understand the brain as an interactionally complex system where functions emerge from distributed, overlapping networks of regions rather than being localised to specific areas. Though the framework described here is still a minority view in neuroscience, we’re witnessing a gradual paradigm transition (rather than a revolution), with increasing numbers of researchers acknowledging the limitations of more traditional ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;omplexity science is an interdisciplinary field that studies systems composed of many interacting components whose collective behaviours give rise to collective properties – phenomena that cannot be fully explained by analysing individual parts in isolation. These systems, such as ecosystems, economies or – as we will see – the brain, are characterised by nonlinear dynamics, adaptability, self-organisation, and networked interactions that span multiple spatial and temporal scales. Before exploring the ideas leading to the entangled brain framework, let’s revisit some of the historical developments of the field of neuroscience to set the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1899, Cécile and Oskar Vogt, aged 24 and 29 respectively, arrived in Berlin to establish the Neurological Centre, initially a private institution for the anatomical study of the human brain that in 1902 was expanded to the Neurobiological Laboratory, and then the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in 1914. Cécile Vogt was one of only two women in the entire institute. (In Prussia, until 1908, women were not granted access to regular university education, let alone the possibility to have a scientific career.) She obtained her doctoral degree from the University of Paris in 1900, while her husband Oskar obtained a doctorate for his thesis on the &lt;em&gt;corpus callosum&lt;/em&gt; from the University of Jena &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;in 1894.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1901, Korbinian Brodmann, who had concluded his doctorate in Leipzig in 1898, joined the group headed by the Vogts and was encouraged by them to undertake a systematic study of the cells of the cerebral cortex using tissue sections stained with a new cell-marking method. (The cortex is the outer brain surface with grooves and bulges; the subcortex comprises other cell masses that sit underneath.) The Vogts, and Brodmann working separately, were part of a first wave of anatomists trying to establish a complete map of the cerebral cortex, with the ultimate goal of understanding how brain structure and function are related. In a nutshell, where does a mental function such as an emotion reside in the brain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons – a key cell type of the nervous system – are diverse, and several cell classes can be determined based on both their shape and size. Researchers used these properties, as well as spatial differences in distribution and density, to define the boundaries between potential sectors. In this manner, Brodmann subdivided the cortex into approximately 50 regions (also called areas) per hemisphere. The Vogts, in contrast, thought that there might be more than 200 of them, each with its own distinguishing cytoarchitectonic pattern (that is, cell-related organisation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;It is an idea that comes close to being an axiom in biology: function is tied to structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brodmann’s map is the one that caught on and stuck, likely because neuroanatomists opposed too vigorous a subdivision of the cortex, and today students and researchers alike still refer to cortical parts by invoking his map. Although relatively little was known about the functions of cortical regions at the time, Brodmann believed that his partition identified ‘organs of the mind’ – he was convinced that each cortical area subserved a particular function. Indeed, when he joined the Vogts’ laboratory, they had encouraged him to try to understand the organisation of the cortex in light of their main thesis that different cytoarchitectonically defined areas are responsible for specific physiological responses and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a deep logic that the Vogts and Brodmann were following. In fact, it is an idea that comes close to being an axiom in biology: function is tied to structure. In the case at hand, parts of the cortex that are structurally different (contain different cell types, cell arrangements, cell density, and so on) carry out different functions. In this manner, they believed they could understand how function is individuated from a detailed characterisation of the underlying microanatomy. They were in search of the &lt;em&gt;functional units &lt;/em&gt;of the cortex – where the function could be sensory, motor, cognitive and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;so on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other organs of the body that have more clear-cut boundaries, the cortex’s potential subdivisions are not readily apparent at a macroscopic level. One of the central goals of many neuroanatomists in the first half of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20th century&lt;/span&gt; was to investigate such ‘organs of the mind’ (an objective that persists to this day). A corollary of this research programme was that individual brain regions – say, Brodmann’s &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;area 17&lt;/span&gt; in the back of the brain – implemented specialised mechanisms, in this case related to processing visual sensory stimuli. Therefore, it was vital to understand the operation of individual parts since the area/region was the rightful mechanistic &lt;em&gt;unit &lt;/em&gt;to understand how the nervous system works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists’ interest in brain regions was motivated by the notion that each region executes a particular function. For example, we could say that the function of the primary visual cortex is visual perception, or perhaps a more basic visual mechanism, such as detecting ‘edges’ (sharp light-to-dark transitions) in images. The same type of description can be applied to other sensory and motor areas of the brain. This exercise becomes considerably less straightforward for brain areas that are much less sensory or motor, as their workings become exceedingly difficult to determine and describe. Nevertheless, in theory, we can imagine extending the idea to all parts of the brain. The result of this endeavour would be a list of area-function pairs: &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;L &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;= {(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;), (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;), … , (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;)},&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;areas &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;implement &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;functions &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a serious problem with this endeavour. To date, no such list has been systematically generated. Indeed, current knowledge strongly suggests that this strategy will &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;yield a simple area-function list. What may start as a simple &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; pair, is gradually revised as research progresses, and eventually grows to include a &lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt; of functions, such that area &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; participates in a series of functions &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, … , &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; From a basic one-to-one &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt; → &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mapping, the picture evolves to a one-to-&lt;em&gt;many &lt;/em&gt;mapping: &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt; → {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;… , F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;sub class="ld-subscript"&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;}.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the mapping between structure and function is not one-to-one, then what kind of system is the brain? This is the question the entangled brain concept sets out to tackle. It’s useful to consider two types of information: anatomical and functional. Let’s start with the brain’s massive combinatorial anatomical connectivity. Neurons are constantly exchanging electrochemical signals with one another. Signalling between them is aided by physical cell extensions, called axons, that protrude beyond the cell body for distances from less than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;1 mm&lt;/span&gt; to around &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;15 mm&lt;/span&gt; in the central nervous system. Axons travelling longer distances typically bundle together along what are called white-matter tracts to distinguish them from tissue composed of neuronal cell bodies, which is called grey matter. Anatomical connectivity, then, can be viewed as a system of roads and highways that supports cell signalling in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hile most connections are local, the brain also maintains an impressive network of medium- and long-distance pathways. To give a rough sense of the dimensions involved, axonal lengths within local brain circuits (such as those within a single Brodmann area) have lengths from less than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;1 mm&lt;/span&gt; to just under &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;1 cm.&lt;/span&gt; Connections between adjacent and nearby regions can extend between 0.5 to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;4 cm,&lt;/span&gt; and connections between areas in different lobes, such as between the frontal and the occipital lobes, can reach &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;15 cm&lt;/span&gt; or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although details vary across mammalian species, there’s evidence that the brains of macaque monkeys (a species that has a brain organisation resembling that of humans) are densely interconnected. For example, when scientists looked at any two regions in the cortex, they found that about &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;60 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of the time there’s a direct connection between them (although the strength of the pathway decreases between regions that are farther apart). Notably, the cortex organises medium- and long-distance communication through special regions that act like major transportation hubs, routing and coordinating signals across the entire cortex, much like how major airports serve as central connection points in the global air transportation network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s just part of the story. Beyond the extensive interconnections found in the cortex, there are multiple ‘connectional systems’ that weave together regions even further. The entire cortex connects to deeper brain structures. We can think of the brain as having distinct sectors. Simplifying somewhat, these are the cortex, the subcortical parts that are physically beneath the cortex in humans, and the brainstem. In the 1980s, it became clear that the cortex and subcortex are part of extensive connectional loops – from cortex to subcortex back to cortex. We now know that the multiple sectors are amply interlinked. What is more, a subcortical structure such as the thalamus, viewed in the past as a relatively passive steppingstone conveying signals to the cortex, is so sweepingly interconnected with the entire cortex that it is perhaps better to think in terms of a cortical-thalamic system. Even subcortical areas believed to mainly control basic functions, like the hypothalamus, which regulates hunger and body temperature among others, have widespread connections throughout the brain. This creates an incredibly intricate connectional web where signals can travel between disparate parts through multiple routes, hence the idea of ‘combinatorial’ connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the implications of the connectional organisation of the brain? The dense nexus of pathways allows for remarkable flexibility in how the brain processes information and controls behaviour. Signals of all types can be exchanged and integrated in multiple ways. All this potential mixing strongly challenges how we traditionally think of the mind and brain in terms of simplistic labels such as ‘perception’, ‘cognition’, ‘emotion’ and ‘action’. I will return to this point later, but the standard view is further challenged by a second principle of brain organisation: highly distributed functional coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Groups of neurons that fire in a coherent fashion indicate that they are functionally interrelated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roman Empire’s roads, critical to its success, were extensive enough to circle the globe about twice over. In addition to obvious military applications, the road network supported trade, as well as cultural and administrative integration. These economic and cultural relationships and coordination between disparate parts of the empire were sustained by the incredible physical infrastructure known as the &lt;em&gt;cursus publicus&lt;/em&gt;. Likewise, in the brain we need to move beyond the anatomical domain (the roads) to functional properties (such as economic and cultural relationships between different parts of the Roman Empire), all the more because neuroscientists themselves often focus too much on anatomical features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brain, functional relationships between neuronal signals are detected across multiple spatial scales – from the local scale of neurons within a brain area to larger scales involving signals originating from the grey matter of different lobes (such as the frontal and parietal lobes, many centimetres apart). By signals, we mean the electrical activity of neurons that is directly recorded via microelectrodes inserted into grey matter (ie, neuronal tissue), measured indirectly when using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans, or possibly via other measurement techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kinds of functional relationships are detected? An important one is that signals from different sites exhibit synchronised neuronal activity. This is notable because groups of neurons that fire in a coherent fashion indicate that they are functionally interrelated, and potentially part of a common process. Different types of signal coordination are believed to reflect processes such as attention and memory, among others. Additional types of relationships are detected mathematically, too, such as whether the strength of the response in one brain area is related to the temporal evolution of signals in a disparate location. In the brain, we identify signal relationships that are indicators of joint functions between regions, much like detecting cultural exchanges between separate parts of the Roman Empire via evidence of shared artefacts or language patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When signals are measured from two sites within a local patch (say, a few millimetres across), it is not too surprising to find notable functional relationships between them (eg, their neuronal activity is correlated), as neurons likely receive similar inputs and are locally connected. Yet, we also observe functional relationships between neuronal signals from locations that are situated much farther apart and, critically, between brain parts that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; directly anatomically connected – there is no direct axonal connection between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this happen? There is evidence that signal coordination between regions depends more on the total number of possible communication routes between them than on the existence of direct connections between points A and B. For example, although regions A and B are not anatomically connected, they both connect to region C, which thus serves as a bridge between them. Even more circuitous paths can unite A and B, much like flying between two cities that have no direct flights and require multiple layovers. In such a manner, the brain creates functional partnerships that take advantage of all possible ways through its intricate pathways. This helps explain how the brain can be so remarkably flexible, sustaining different partnerships between regions depending on what we’re doing, thinking or feeling at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hen we consider the highways traversing the brain and how signals establish behaviourally relevant relationships across the central nervous system, we come to an important insight. In a highly interconnected system, to understand function, we need to shift away from thinking in terms of individual brain regions. The functional unit is not to be found at the level of the brain area, as commonly proposed. Instead, we need to consider neuronal ensembles distributed across multiple brain regions, much like the murmuration of starlings forms a single pattern from the collective behaviour of individual birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many instances of distributed neuronal ensembles. Groups of neurons extending over cortical (say, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) and subcortical (say, amygdala) regions form circuits that are important for learning what is threatening and what is safe. Such multiregion circuits are ubiquitous; fMRI studies in humans have shown that the brain is organised in terms of large-scale networks that stretch across the cortex as well as subcortical territories. For example, the so-called ‘salience network’ (suggested to be engaged when significant events are encountered) spans brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobes, among others, and can also be viewed as a neuronal ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we consider ensembles in the case of brain circuits or large-scale networks, the associated neuronal groupings should be viewed as strongly context dependent and dynamic. That is to say, they are not fixed entities but instead form dynamically to meet current situational requirements. Accordingly, they will dynamically assemble and disassemble as per behavioural needs. The implication of this view is that whereas brain regions A, B and C might generally be active together in dealing with a specific type of behaviour, in some contexts, we will also observe an ensemble that encompasses &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;region D,&lt;/span&gt; or instead the ensemble &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;{A, C, D}&lt;/span&gt; that meets slightly different requirements. In all, neuronal ensembles constitute an extremely malleable functional unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of how an orchestra works during a complex piece of music. The string section might split into different groups, with some violins joining the woodwinds for one musical phrase while others harmonise with the cellos. Later, these groupings shift completely for a different passage. The brain works in a related way: rather than recruiting fixed regions, it forms flexible aggregations that assemble and disassemble based on what we’re doing, thinking or feeling. This builds on what we learned about the brain’s extensive physical connections and the coordinated activity across regions. These features make the formation of ensembles possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Brain regions can participate in multiple networks simultaneously and shift their roles as needed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is common in science, these ideas have a long genealogy. In 1949, the Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb proposed that the brain’s ability to generate coherent thoughts derives from the spatiotemporal orchestration of neuronal activity. He hypothesised that a discrete, strongly interconnected group of active neurons called the &lt;em&gt;cell assembly&lt;/em&gt; represents a distinct mental entity, such as a thought or an emotion. Yet, these ideas have taken a long time to mature, not least due to technical limitations in measuring signals simultaneously across the brain, and the relative insularity of experimental neuroscience from other disciplines, such as computer science, mathematics and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a symphony emerges from both the individual instruments and how they play together, brain function emerges from both the regions themselves and their dynamic interactions. Scientists are finding that we can’t understand complex mental processes by studying individual brain regions in isolation, any more than we could understand a symphony by listening to each instrument separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s particularly fascinating is that these brain assemblages overlap and change over time. Just as a violin might be part of the string section in one moment and join a smaller ensemble in the next, brain regions can participate in multiple networks simultaneously and shift their roles as needed. But note that, in this view, even brain networks aren’t seen as constituted of fixed sets of regions; instead, they are dynamic coalitions that form and dissolve based on the brain’s changing needs. This flexibility helps explain how the brain can support such a wide range of complex behaviours using a limited number of regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categories such as perception, cognition, action, emotion and motivation are not only the titles of introductory textbooks, but reflect how psychologists and neuroscientists conceptualise the organisation of the mind and brain. They seek to subdivide the brain into territories that have preferences for processes that support a specific type of mental activity. Some parts handle perception, such as the back of the head and its involvement in vision, or the front of the brain and its role in cognition. And so on. The decomposition of the mind-brain adopted by many neuroscientists follows an organisation that is called modular. Modularity here refers to the idea that the brain consists of specialised, relatively independent components or modules that each handle specific mental functions, much like distinct parts in a machine that work together but perform separate operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, a modular organisation, popular as it is among neuroscientists, is inconsistent with the principles of the anatomical and functional neuroarchitecture discussed here. The brain’s massive combinatorial connectivity and highly distributed functional coordination defy clean compartmentalisation. The extensive bidirectional pathways spanning the entire brain create crisscrossing connectional systems that dissolve potential boundaries between traditional mental domains (cognition, &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;emotion, etc).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Anxiety, PTSD, depression and so on should be viewed as system-level entities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain regions dynamically affiliate with multiple networks in a context-dependent manner, forming coalitions that assemble and disassemble based on current demands. This interactional complexity means that functions aren’t localised to discrete modules but emerge from decentralised coordination across multiregion assemblies. The properties that emerge from these interactions cannot be reduced to individual components, making a strict modular framework inadequate for capturing the brain’s entangled nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the brain so entangled, and thus so unlike human-engineered systems? Brains have evolved to provide adaptive responses to challenges faced by living beings, promoting survival and reproduction – not to solve isolated cognitive or emotional problems. In this context, even the mental vocabulary of neuroscience and psychology (attention, cognitive control, fear, etc), with origins disconnected from the study of animal behaviour, provides problematic theoretical pillars. Instead, approaches inspired by evolutionary considerations provide better scaffolds to sort out the relationships between brain structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of the entangled brain are substantial for the understanding of healthy and unhealthy brain processes. It is common for scientists to seek a single, unique source of psychological distress. For example, anxiety or PTSD is the result of an overactive amygdala; depression is caused by deficient serotonin provision; drug addiction is produced by dopamine oversupply. But, according to the ideas described here, we should not expect unique determinants for psychological states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety, PTSD, depression and so on should be viewed as system-level entities. Alterations across several brain circuits, spanning multiple brain regions, are almost certainly involved. As a direct consequence, healthy or unhealthy states should not be viewed as emotional, motivational or cognitive. Such classification is superficial and neglects the intermingling that results from anatomical and functional brain organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should also not expect to find a single culprit, not even at the level of distributed neuronal ensembles. The conditions in question are too heterogeneous and varied across individuals; they won’t map to a single alteration, including at the distributed level. In fact, we should not expect a temporally constant type of disturbance, as brain processes are highly context-dependent and dynamic. Variability in the very dynamics will contribute to how mental health experiences are manifested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we need to stop seeking simple explanations for complex mind-brain processes, whether they are viewed as healthy or unhealthy. That’s perhaps the most general implication of the entangled brain view: that the functions of the brain, like the murmurations of starlings, are more complicated and more mysterious than its component parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 10:04:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPbDJobXBaTzlmT21lZ2tPLWJ3dDlVU182T3dQS29wYVZBUFJCMVgzT21fU05CTlYtcVdjVlBvdVl2eTk5dHZYSi1PV1Nxb1BKVTgtSEhSYVo3WHgybjFvUmFaQ3had3BlaHM0WDRMbUF5RnpQWEJDQ3U0TzJqWUtjbnNwWQ</guid></item><item><title>您的能量饮料可能正在喂养癌症吗？科学家刚刚发现了什么-SciTechDaily | Could Your Energy Drink Be Feeding Cancer?

That is a process that breaks down glucose for energy and supports cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;“This study is one of the first to show that taurine may actually help drive cancer growth,” Bajaj said. “Leukemia cells hijack taurine to fuel their survival.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Jane Liesvaeld, M.D., a Wilmot oncologist and co-author of the study, has urged caution when it comes to taurine supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;The amino acid is a common ingredient in energy drinks, protein powders, and certain foods. This includes meat, fish, and eggs. The amino acid is also found in the brain, heart, and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;KIRO TV adds that cancer patients sometimes take it to ease chemotherapy side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;“Dr. Bajaj’s work shows that local levels of taurine in bone marrow may enhance leukemia growth, suggesting caution in the use of high-dose taurine supplementation,” Liesveld said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Researchers said more work needs to be done to understand what role taurine plays in cancer development and resistance to treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;Bajaj said one of the next steps is to study taurine levels in leukemia patients. Then, develop methods for safely blocking taurine from entering cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;“Since taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks and is often provided as a supplement to mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy, our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the benefits of supplemental taurine in leukemia patients,” the authors wrote in their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[SIGN UP: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://membercenter.whio.com/newsletters" target="_self" rel="" title="https://membercenter.whio.com/newsletters"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph body-copyright"&gt;©2025 Cox Media Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WHIO TV</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 08:14:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>认证培训师- Fit&amp;Well表示，如果您想随着年龄的增长保持机动性、力量和独立性，请不要忽视这两点 | Don’t neglect these two things if you want to maintain your mobility, strength and independence as you age, says a certified trainer - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgJBVV95cUxOcUUwZk5MeTZSRDFVanlsT0FXdzBLOFZnWlNleUxzV0xUOWd2Y3VZby1xR2s0TlBwTFNreXJfNkNwSTNkZXNCWXBzNFI0ODBFTS1Gc0hnVTktRG1kLUlWTUJLWFU0QjMtZWV6Ny0tek5PM0tLSktMbThjTk14Ri1EamxIWEs0N2dyYmYxN1RqQmxLVnZmUkx0S3EzM3JwaUFNcmd3S016a28wSWprZGhlSzZ2X3NxUElvRk5ZaVdrTXM3Z2diSEpQbF9XREhVbm5ITnI5YkhxVHBHSXd5aDFzcjJEc1VZWTMzaExndjZZdGlwRG9qaWJFU19CbXRaX1REcUgzTE9BaGJvdGR1bmdzVXV2Ums1Y3NxZ0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes to think about aging, but it’s a fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With every passing year from your mid-40s, muscle mass tends to become harder to maintain, bones weaken, joints stiffen and cardiovascular fitness declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;David Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; master trainer &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/jc_training_/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/jc_training_/?hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Jack Claxton&lt;/a&gt;, everybody has two trump cards we can play to offset this natural ageing process—and the earlier we start, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Improving your VO2 max and regular strength training are two massive things for longevity,” Claxton tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together they are going to be what makes the greatest difference when you’re 70, 80 or 90 to your mobility, strength and ability to be independent,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At David Lloyd Clubs, Claxton trains a broad range of clients, young and old, experienced and inexperienced, but his advice always returns to these two principles. Here’s why and how to get started on improving each one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-strength-training"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

VO2 max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: The Good Brigade / Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aligned with this advice, Claxton recommends that everyone devotes at least two training sessions per week to resistance exercise and a third to performing low-intensity steady-state cardio like brisk walking, running, cycling or swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly practicing steady-state cardio, a type of aerobic exercise in which your body uses oxygen to create energy, will gradually improve the health and efficiency of your respiratory system—and in turn your VO2 max scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VO2&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;max is the maximum amount of oxygen your body is able to use during exercise—or any activity, from hiking and gardening to tackling a HYROX race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher your scores, the more oxygen your body can consume, and the more efficiently it can convert that into energy to fuel your activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to improve your VO2 max&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like your maximum heart rate, your VO2&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;max will naturally decline with age. But, as with your heart, regular exercise can slow or even reverse this natural decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend too much time on the internet and you will see many experts insist VO2 max is improved with intense interval sessions. They’re not wrong, but for many of us, epecially those who are returning to exercise, it can pay to start slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no right or wrong approach to cardio,” says Claxton. “It just comes down to what you enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So for an absolute beginner, who might not be doing anything at the minute, something as simple as going out for a walk every day would be an improvement.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity of semaglutide drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy for weight loss, surveys suggest that most people still &lt;a href="https://pcrm.widen.net/s/ddlsxvhlvp/pcrm-mc-weight-loss-report-9.27.24"&gt;prefer to lose weight without using medications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those preferring a drug-free approach to weight loss, research shows that certain nutrients and dietary strategies can naturally mimic the effects of semaglutides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased intakes of fibre and monounsaturated fats (found in olive oil and avocadoes) – as well as the time of day when foods are eaten, the order that foods are eaten in, the speed of eating and even chewing – can naturally stimulate increased production of the same hormone responsible for the effects of semaglutide drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

A strategic approach to weight loss rooted in the latest science is not only superior to antiquated calorie counting, but also capitalizes on the same biological mechanisms responsible for the success of popular weight-loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="olive oil pouring into a glass dish, with some green olives" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=502&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=502&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/665965/original/file-20250506-56-3ckecm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=502&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Increased intake of monounsaturated fats (found in olive oil and avocadoes) is one factor in naturally stimulating GLP-1 production — the same hormone responsible for the effects of semaglutide drugs like Ozempic. (Stevepb/Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide medications work by increasing the levels of a hormone called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1), a satiety signal that slows digestion and makes us feel full. These drugs also simultaneously decrease levels of an enzyme called DPP-4, which inactivates GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, this "stop eating" hormone that naturally survives for only a few minutes can survive for an entire week. This enables a semi-permanent, just-eaten sensation of fullness that consequently leads to decreased food intake and, ultimately, weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, medications aren't the only way to raise GLP-1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you eat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre – predominantly found in beans, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds – is the most notable nutrient that can significantly increase GLP-1. When fibre is fermented by the trillions of bacteria that live in our intestines, the resultant byproduct, called short chain fatty acids, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aao5774"&gt;stimulates the production of GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may explain why fibre consumption is one of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxz117"&gt;strongest predictors of weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqz292"&gt;shown to enable weight loss&lt;/a&gt; even in the absence of calorie restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monounsaturated fats – found in olive oil and avocado oil – are another nutrient that raises GLP-1. One study showed that GLP-1 levels were higher &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/69.6.1135"&gt;following the consumption of bread and olive oil&lt;/a&gt; compared to bread and butter. Though notably, bread consumed with any kind of fat (be it from butter or even cheese) &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2013.275"&gt;raises GLP-1 more than bread alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study showed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11050952"&gt;having an avocado&lt;/a&gt; alongside your breakfast bagel also increases GLP-1 more so than eating the bagel on its own. Nuts that are high in both fibre and monounsaturated fats, like pistachios, have also been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2013.275"&gt;shown to raise GLP-1 levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How you eat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the specific foods and nutrients that influence GLP-1 levels are only half the story. GLP-1 is a good example of how it's not just what you eat that matters, it's also how you eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that meal sequence – the order foods are eaten in – can impact GLP-1. Eating protein, like fish or meat, before carbohydrates, like rice, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3841-z"&gt;results in a higher GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; compared to eating carbohydrates before protein. Eating vegetables before carbohydrates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpvm.IJPVM_704_20"&gt;has a similar effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161818" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161818" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642.jpg" alt="man eating salad" class="wp-image-161818 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/man_eating_salad_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161818" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The order of food and the timing of meals can all affect levels of GLP-1. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MACmIUKTQC8/"&gt;Michal Collection/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time of day also matters, because like all hormones, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.991397"&gt;GLP-1 follows a circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;. A meal eaten at 8 am stimulates a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-0366"&gt;more pronounced release of GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; compared to the same meal at 5 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may partly explain why the old saying "eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper" is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.20460"&gt;backed by evidence&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrates greater weight loss when breakfast is the largest meal of the day and dinner is the smallest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of eating can matter, too. Eating ice cream over 30 minutes has been shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-1018"&gt;produce a significantly higher GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; compared to eating ice cream over five minutes. However, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15051174"&gt;studies looking at blood sugar responses&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that if vegetables are eaten first, the speed of eating becomes less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even chewing matters. One study showed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58103-w"&gt;eating shredded cabbage raised GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; more than drinking pureed cabbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not as potent as medication&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While certain foods and dietary strategies can increase GLP-1 naturally, the magnitude is far less than what is achievable with medications. One study of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/dmrr.3406"&gt;GLP-1 raising effects of the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated a peak GLP-1 level of approximately 59 picograms per millilitre of blood serum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product monograph for Ozempic reports that the lowest dose &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/209637lbl.pdf"&gt;produces a GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; of 65 nanograms per millilitre (one nanogram = 1,000 picograms). So medications raise GLP-1 more than one thousand times higher than diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, when you compare long-term risk for diseases like heart attacks, the &lt;a href="https://www.dietitians.ca/DietitiansOfCanada/media/Documents/Mediterranean%20Diet%20Toolkit/Mediterranean-Diet-Toolkit-A-Guide-to-Healthy-Eating-(handout).pdf"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1800389"&gt;lowers risk of cardiac events by 30 per cent&lt;/a&gt;, outperforming GLP-1 medications that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563"&gt;lower risk by 20 per cent&lt;/a&gt;. While weight loss will always be faster with medications, for overall health, dietary approaches are superior to medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following strategies are important for those trying to lose weight without a prescription:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strive to make breakfast the largest meal of the day (or at least frontload your day as much as possible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim to eat at least one fibre-rich food at every meal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make olive oil a dietary staple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be mindful of the order that you eat foods in, consume protein and vegetables before carbohydrates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snack on nuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chew your food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While natural approaches to raising GLP-1 may not be as potent as medications, they provide a drug-free approach to weight loss and healthy eating.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253728/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The United States on Friday approved the first blood test for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="161799" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, a move that could help patients begin treatment earlier with newly approved drugs that slow the progression of the devastating neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test, developed by Fujirebio Diagnostics, measures the ratio of two proteins in the blood. The rato is correlated with amyloid plaques in the brain – a hallmark of Alzheimer's that, until now, has been detected only through brain scans or spinal fluid analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's disease impacts too many people – more than breast  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="161799" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and prostate cancer combined," &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Knowing that 10 percent of people aged 65 and older have Alzheimer's, and that by 2050 that number is expected to double, I am hopeful that new medical products such as this one will help patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently two FDA approved treatments for Alzheimer's: lecanemab and donanemab, which target amyloid plaque and have been shown to modestly slow cognitive decline, though they do not cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the intravenous  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="161799" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; therapies, including many neurologists, say they can offer patients a few additional months of independence – and are likely to be more effective if started earlier in the disease's course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In clinical studies, the blood test produced results largely in line with positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans and spinal fluid analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160391" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160391" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodOnTestSlide-642x260.jpg" alt="A Blood Marker Could Give Us a Decade of Early Warning For Some Alzheimer's Cases" class="wp-image-160391 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodOnTestSlide-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodOnTestSlide-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodOnTestSlide-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodOnTestSlide.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160391" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Per the FDA's announcment, the test measures two proteins found in human plasma, a component of blood, and calculates the numerical ratio of the levels of the two proteins. This ratio is correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient's brain, reducing the need for a PET scan. The method only requires a simple blood draw, making it less invasive and much easier for patients to access than other more invasive techniques. (fotostorm/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's clearance is an important step for Alzheimer's diagnosis, making it easier and potentially more accessible for US patients earlier in the disease," said Michelle Tarver of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test is authorized for use in clinical settings for patients showing signs of cognitive decline, and results must be interpreted alongside other clinical information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia. It worsens over time, gradually robbing people of their memories and independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A more proactive approach is critical to reaching and diagnosing those who remain unaware of their infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the "simple change" to the GP registration process was "a vital step forward" to ensure nobody affected by contaminated blood is "undiagnosed and unsupported".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The failures of the contaminated blood scandal have had a horrifying impact for patients and their families for decades, and I would like to reiterate our deepest apologies for the role the health service played in the suffering and loss for so many," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health officials say the risk of getting an infection from a blood transfusion or from blood products since screening of blood donations was introduced, is very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;All blood donations have been screened for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C since September 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:59:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9YVDdSYVVOb0xyQ01YWlNEckxVREpHRktwMWpOYkNvVlhyMEI5SUVsdm1qX0FsbThCNFVmanhxMzdCN1M5LWZjRWZvY3g2QzdSUGpNemJGRUJkUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5tVHpYeno4QW0wWk1IZnNsZDFZRllyNXdadXpPWmpjcFduVG5BaTJGdWtzR3cwbldELUlYOGladjAwTlRoY2Y5RExMMVNsOS1jZVM4TW1tMzJ1bnI2ZjVJ</guid></item><item><title>我儿子的肚子疼原来是一种罕见且具有侵略性的癌症-这是我希望每个父母都知道的-每日邮报 | My son's tummy ache turned out to be a rare and aggressive cancer - here's what I want every parent to know be - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a lively and energetic six-year-old boy, William Smith loved animals and music, he was a sports fan and had a passion for the police force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When he fell ill with an upset stomach and appeared lethargic, many parents would have just chalked it up to a benign, temporary illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It would have been so easy to say it was a virus, but I just knew deep down in my gut that something was wrong,' William's mum Danielle told Daily Mail Australia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was showing signs of separation anxiety, which wasn't like him, and I thought to myself, 'I really need to have this looked at and hopefully I'm just being a paranoid parent.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tragically, Danielle's instincts were right and a devastating diagnosis was about to turn their world upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mum-of-three took William to see their family doctor and she shared her concerns, so the doctor agreed to run a series of tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two days later they returned to receive the results. 'We were told 'you need to go home and pack a bag for William and yourself - we didn't know what that meant other than we knew one of the test results showed spots on his liver.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family went to the Emergency department at Westmead Children's Hospital and after speaking with a doctor they met with an Oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Danielle Smith has shared how at aged six her son William suffered from an upset stomach and appeared lethargic. Although these symptoms could easily have been a virus, she pushed for further investigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I remember him saying: 'I hope I'm the wrong doctor for you,' but explained that they needed to run more tests.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially the team thought it was lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, and tests showed that William had several tumours throughout his body, the largest being on his liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The oncologist was showing the scans and was pointing out the tumours, they were all through his body. I just kept thinking how could there be this many tumours and we didn't know and how could there be this many tumours and William didn't know,' Danielle shared as her voice began to crack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He went down the scan and said 'this is William's heart', he scrolled down and said, 'this is the tumour on the liver.' I asked him to scroll back up because the primary tumour was bigger than his heart. How could it be bigger than his heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That is the moment that killed me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After having tests at the doctors, Danielle was told to pack a bag for her and her son and head to the hospital, where staff were waiting for them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet despite learning that crushing information that would be impossible for any parent to hear, Danielle remained stoic and strong for William.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can't fall apart but so much happens so fast. When you've got your six-year-old who asks: 'Mum am I going to die?' — what do you say to your child in that moment? You have to protect your child and do the best you can. You just can't fall apart.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly two weeks after being admitted to hospital and after William had already started chemotherapy treatment, he was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer that starts in the early nerve cells of the sympathetic nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;William's cancer was stage 4, high-risk and aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What followed was a gruelling series of treatments for William, including six rounds of chemotherapy, two back to back bone marrow transplants that saw him put in isolation from the public for nine long months, radiation and immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly two weeks after being admitted to hospital and after William had already started chemotherapy treatment, he was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;What followed was a gruelling series of treatments for William, including six rounds of chemotherapy, two back to back bone marrow transplants that saw him put in isolation from the public for nine long months, radiation and immunotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 18 months after treatment had begun, William was finally finished, but then in a cruel twist, a scan showed another tumour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It fell into a pattern at that point, another scan, another tumour, another scan, another tumour. This went on for a while,' Danielle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2018 we were away on a holiday on the coast there was about 30 of us making memories together and I knew that something wasn't right. I noticed that one of his eyes had turned and he wasn't looking straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We had scans booked when we got home and at that point the oncologist had asked William to stay in the waiting room and he told me to prepare myself, I knew what he was going to say.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was given 6 to 8 weeks. I had prepared myself that he was palliative, and I had got to a point but everything I had read said it would be six to eight months, so I assumed that we had that time. I can't even put that into words how I felt when I heard that prognosis. Pretty much eight weeks later he passed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tragically in early 2018 William passed away and the family were left devastated &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Despite knowing what was coming in those last eight weeks, if you were around him, you wouldn't have known, people couldn't believe he was so sick, he didn't let it show,' Danielle said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During his gruelling treatment, William was happy to share his experience with other children and families who were going through the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was very open and willing to talk about his experience. He talked to other children at the hospital and was very willing to advocate on what he was going through. My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer and they would talk together about it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danielle and her two eldest children were inspired by William to help other children and their relatives who were battling cancer and raise funds for the Kids With Cancer charity by hosting the annual Gold Ribbon Ball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It gives purpose to why William was here. We would struggle to deal with something so terrible happening to us without it, so the three of us definitely use it as a healing technique and way of coping with our grief,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;William's mum and siblings were inspired by him to help other families and fundraise for Kids with Cancer. To honour William's memory on what would have been his 16th birthday they are raising awareness for the charity's Care Pack 4 Kids campaign &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This month, to recognise what would have been William's 16th birthday, Danielle is raising awareness for the charity's &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kidswithcancer.org.au/care-packs-4-kids/"&gt;Care Packs 4 Kids campaign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bespoke gift boxes contain sweet and savoury snacks, puzzles and activities and a hand-written inspirational note. The packs are offered to oncology patients each time they attend a children's hospital across Australia.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Time in hospital is long and whether you're there for a day visit or a longer stay it's really hard to keep your child entertained. The care packs provide that bit of distraction but it also hits home that there is somebody out there that cares with the handwritten notes,' Danielle explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Something so small can make a big difference and even if it's just for five minutes that the child forgets about their cancer or their treatment, it's like five years for the parents.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I think if William was with us today he's be joining in the fundraising, he'd probably be leading it and driving it. I think he'd be proud,' she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given what Danielle and her family went through, the Sydney mum is well placed to share advice to families who find themselves in a similar situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those who might be going through a possible cancer diagnosis she said, 'My advice would be to advocate for your child and to voice how you feel, voice what your concerns are.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danielle admits it was 'hard' for her to accept help from others in the period following William's diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It took me a good few months to accept the support and to advocate for him and ask all of the questions.

Pesticides. Golf courses often use significant amounts of pesticides to maintain their pristine appearance. These chemicals can become airborne or leach into the groundwater, leading to increased exposure for nearby residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights concerns about water contamination. Residents who share a water source with a golf course, particularly those relying on groundwater, face nearly double the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease compared to those with separate water sources. This risk is even more pronounced in areas with vulnerable geological features, such as karst topography, which allows for easier movement of contaminants into the water supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the findings underscore the need for public health policies aimed at reducing pesticide exposure, especially in residential areas near golf courses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing stricter regulations on pesticide use and improving water treatment processes could mitigate some of the risks identified in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti aging billionaire Bryan Johnson shared on X a screenshot of the study. "It's a good idea to routinely test the water you drink," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What pesticides are harmful?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to golf courses and Parkinson’s disease, the most concerning pesticides are those that have been scientifically linked to neurotoxicity — meaning they can damage or disrupt the nervous system. Here are the main culprits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraquat: Paraquat has been heavily linked to Parkinson’s disease in numerous studies. It kills plant cells through oxidative stress, and researchers believe it may do the same to neurons in the human brain — particularly those involved in motor control. It is banned in over 30 countries (including the EU and China), but still used in the U.S. under restricted conditions. "The US Environmental Protection Agency classifies paraquat as "restricted use."1 This means that it can be used only by people who have licenses. Because paraquat is highly poisonous, the United States requires the following safety measures: Blue dye is added to keep it from being confused with other beverages," the US CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chlorpyrifos: It is banned in the U.S. for food crops as of 2021, but may still be used on golf courses or in non-agricultural settings. It is known to disrupt neurotransmitter function, especially acetylcholine. Prenatal and long-term exposure is associated with developmental delays and neurological disorders. It is an organophosphate insecticide used to kill a range of insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maneb and Mancozeb (Dithiocarbamates): These are fungicides often used in landscaping, including on golf courses and are often studied in combination with Paraquat; exposure to both has shown to drastically increase Parkinson’s risk. These chemicals disrupt dopamine production — a key hormone depleted in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glyphosate: Although primarily linked to cancer (specifically non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), emerging research suggests glyphosate might also affect gut health and neurological function — both of which are closely linked to Parkinson’s. It is world’s most widely used herbicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case-control study included patients with incident PD and matched controls from the Rochester Epidemiology Project from 1991 to 2015. Data were analyzed between June and August 2024. A total of 419 incident PD cases were identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么你的手和脚总是很冷，以及你的身体试图告诉你什么- AOL.com | Why Your Hands and Feet Are Always Cold—and What Your Body’s Trying To Tell You - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5mTlVIY1J5WEVWSFl2TjYxUzVUd2VkdjgwRm5hUGs2czV1WklXRzJ6c0ZrQXNydG1aeFU2enVVQjZCMXRKQnoyTFhWYS1yWjU3WVRGLVVzbjV3THVOR0xNN2tnN1RhUzBmQThlRFd3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re lying on the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/shopping/soscana-4-seat-sectional-sofa-walmart-sale-may-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sofa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sofa&lt;/a&gt;, sitting at work or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1151185/ericasweeney/benefits-of-walking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; around outside, your hands and feet are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; cold.

Besides cold hands and feet, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21882-poor-circulation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:you may notice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;you may notice&lt;/a&gt; muscles that hurt or feel weak when you walk, a “pins and needles” sensation, a pale or blue skin color, and numbness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“When blood flow to the extremities is reduced, the body has a harder time keeping those areas warm,” explains &lt;a href="https://claya.com/our-medical-experts/#dr-jennifer-habashy-nmd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jennifer Habashy, NMD, MS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Jennifer Habashy, NMD, MS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a naturopathic doctor and assistant medical director at Claya. She says poor circulation is “one of the more common reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What helps, Dr. Habashy continues, is staying active with &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/walking-10000-steps-a-day-for-a-month-results" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:daily movement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;daily movement&lt;/a&gt;, wearing warm socks or gloves and trying contrast hydrotherapy (so alternating warm and cold water on your hands and feet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Raynaud’s disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/raynauds-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20363571" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Raynaud’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Raynaud’s&lt;/a&gt; is when small blood vessels narrow in response to cold temperatures or stress. Signs include areas of skin turning white then blue, and a numb, prickly feeling or stinging pain upon warming up or easing stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The good news is it’s treatable. “With Raynaud’s or circulation-related issues, keep warm, avoid smoking, limit caffeine and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/997659/nicolepajer/stress-relief/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:manage stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;manage stress&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Khanna says. To manage stress, he recommends cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1036167/marijkevroomendurning/what-is-mindfulness/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mindfulness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1072693/jenniferlarson/rare-autoimmune-diseases/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 Rare Autoimmune Diseases That Don’t Get Enough Attention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Rare Autoimmune Diseases That Don’t Get Enough Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hypothyroidism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/hypothyroidism.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hypothyroidism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hypothyroidism&lt;/a&gt; is an underactive thyroid. But how does that affect the temperature of your hands and feet? Dr. Habashy says it’s “where a sluggish thyroid slows down metabolic activity, reducing the body’s ability to generate heat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other signs include fatigue, weight gain, joint and muscle pain, constipation, dry skin, thinning hair and more. “Cold intolerance is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; common in hypothyroidism,” Dr. Khanna adds. “I always check for this.” To determine if you have this condition, these doctors recommend getting a full thyroid panel at your doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Anemia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anemia&lt;/a&gt; is a common blood disorder in which a person doesn’t have enough red blood cells, or the ones they have don’t function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1229513/shameikarhymes/iron-infusion-for-anemia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘I Had Iron Infusions to Treat My Severe Anemia’—Writer Shameika Rhymes Opens Up About Her Health Journey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘I Had Iron Infusions to Treat My Severe Anemia’—Writer Shameika Rhymes Opens Up About Her Health Journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anemia is also a frequent contributor, as low iron levels impair oxygen delivery to tissues, which can make the extremities feel cold,” Dr. Kabashy explains. Additional signs include weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness, irregular heartbeat, headache, chest pain and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition needs to be assessed by your primary care provider, Dr. Khanna says, who can order a CBC (AKA, a complete blood count) test and iron studies. He and Dr. Habashy also recommend addressing the nutritional side of things; make sure you &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1143900/shameikarhymes/foods-high-in-iron/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:get enough iron;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;get enough iron&lt;/a&gt;, B12 and folate in your diet.

So, remember to eat those foods listed above. You can also get labs to assess which nutrients you’re deficient in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Persistent cold hands and feet aren’t always something to brush off,” she concludes. “Paying attention to your patterns (and getting the right testing) can help uncover the root cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1339453/emily-laurence/toe-cramps/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Ouch!

commonly referred to as the 'paisa mutation' - has been &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-2897185/The-village-residents-dementia-age-40-Genetic-mutation-marrying-families-means-Yamural-curse-spiralling-control.html"&gt;passed down by a gene from a single common ancestor&lt;/a&gt; to an extended lineage of 6,000 people in the town and it &lt;font&gt;causes Alzheimer's in nearly every person that has it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;Located on the 14th chromosome, it leads to a devastating form of early-onset Alzheimer's and leaves patients suffering from crippling dementia. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;font&gt;Those who have the mutation also have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's as early as their 30s.&lt;/font&gt; In the US, the average age is 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, after decades of misery, one person's unique genetic mutation could hold the secret to a cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jennie Erin Smith, author of &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Valley of Forgetting: Alzheimer's Families and the Search for a Cure&lt;/span&gt;, followed University of California Santa Barbara neuroscientist Dr Kenneth Kosik and Colombian neuroscientist Dr Francisco Lopera as they spent four decades studying Yarumal residents - until they stumbled upon Aliria Rosa Piedrahita de Villegas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Piedrahita de Villegas, who died at 77 from cancer, was born and raised in Yarumal and had the paisa mutation. However, she spent her entire life without being afflicted by Alzheimer's,&lt;span&gt; even &lt;/span&gt;as her younger family members were plagued by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A perplexing case, scientists eventually learned that not only did she have the dementia gene, she had another mutation that actually safeguarded her from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thousands of residents in Yarumal, a quaint town, have been suffering from Alzheimer's disease - showing signs in their 30s and 40s, dying in their 50s - all due to a genetic mutation &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, experts believe if they are able to understand and replicate the mysterious protective effect observed in Piedrahita de Villegas's brain, they might be able to prevent the development of the disease in other people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kosik recalled: 'She was so fascinating because she had this mutation that just inevitably leads to Alzheimer's disease and here she was, 70-something years old and still fine.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through her participation in the team's research and her family's willingness to donate her brain after her death in 2020, both neuroscientists have been able to make significant progress in understanding&lt;span&gt; potential cures for a disease that affects about 44million people globally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common forms of dementia and mostly affects older adults. About 7million people in the US 65 and older live with the condition and over 100,00 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The illness begins due to the development of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain - which damage and kill cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amyloid protein molecules stick together in the brain cells, forming clumps called plaques. Tau proteins twist together in fiber-like strands called tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles block the ability of the brain's neurons to send electrical and chemical signals back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this disruption causes permanent damage in the brain that leads to the development of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The World Health Organization predicts 115million people worldwide will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Pictured is a brain scan of a 74-year-old patient with the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no clear cause of the disease, experts believe it can develop due to genetic mutations and lifestyle choices, such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and social isolation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no cure but doctors can prescribe treatments and therapies to try and ease symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Kosik believes he may have now uncovered previously unknown clues as to how Piedrahita de Villegas managed to evade the disease while her entire family succumbed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: University of California Santa Barbara neuroscientist Dr Kenneth Kosik&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with the UCSB neuroscientist, investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital found Piedrahita de Villegas's brain had exceptionally large quantities of amyloid protein but nearly no tau protein. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the lack of tau protein, her brain didn't develop the hallmark tangles of Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Kosik said: '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;One clue that appeared when researchers examined her brain tissue [was] while Aliria had the same overproduction of plaques that the rest of her family had, the tangles of misfolded tau protein that typically accompany the plaques in Alzheimer's patients in her were relatively scant, keeping intact things like motor skills and executive function.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to the paisa mutation, the team also found her DNA carried two copies of another rare gene mutation called &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0611-3#Abs1"&gt;apolipoprotein or APOE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A single parent can pass down the mutation, located on the 14th chromosome – which causes a devastating form of early-onset Alzheimer's and leave patients suffering from dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as the Christchurch mutation, the APOE gene variant allowed her body to produce lipoproteins that protected her brain from Alzheimer's disease by counteracting the effects of the amyloid protein-caused plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lipoproteins are molecules made of proteins and fats in the body and they carry cholesterol through the bloodstream to cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two main groups of lipoproteins are called HDL (high-density lipoprotein) or 'good' cholesterol and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or 'bad' cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, scientists are hoping this discovery can lead to treatments or preventatives therapies for people with or at risk of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Kosik said: 'The probability of one rare mutation is very small, but a person with two exceptionally rare mutations in the setting of an Alzheimer's rare mutation, how unlikely is that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'She was a very important patient; her story made news all over the world. We learned a lot from her - and now that she's died, it's on us to make sure we give it a careful look.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your diet and overall lifestyle play a key role in your health across your lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, fiber, vitamins and minerals support healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of these convenient and affordable healthy-aging staples are likely on your pantry shelves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pantry food items can make meal prep and planning more convenient, cost-effective and nutritious (when you have the right ingredients). What you eat regularly has a significant impact on your health. Qianzhi Jiang, RD, Ph.D., says, “A nutrient-dense eating plan that emphasizes plant-based food sources is associated with lower mortality and healthier longevity.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietary choices directly and indirectly impact your quality of life. “Good nutrition supports continued energy, mood, digestion and sleep quality—all things that contribute to a better quality of life, especially as we age,” says &lt;a href="https://realnutritionnyc.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amy Shapiro, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating for longevity means choosing foods that improve your lifespan and your “health span.” Jiang says, “As a health expert, I look at years spent in good health and with a high quality of life.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We have a certain level of control over our health as we age, which can be very empowering. &lt;a href="https://maggiemoon.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, says, “About 75% of our health span is determined by our lifestyle choices, not our genetics.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try not to be overwhelmed by this and instead focus on starting small; a few tweaks to your pantry might be just the right place to get started.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-walnuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Walnuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Perhaps it’s not a coincidence that walnuts are shaped like mini brains. “Studies have linked regular walnut consumption with lower inflammation and better cognitive aging,” says Shapiro.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moon adds, “A clinical trial found that eating one to two handfuls of walnuts a day may slow cognitive decline for older adults, especially those with limited access to healthy foods.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Moon also says that eating walnuts in midlife may help stave off early brain changes that lead to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jiang always stocks seaweed in her pantry for snacks or cooking. “Low in calories, but packed with fiber, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and polysaccharides, seaweeds can assist in lowering the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moon notes that seaweed is a vegetarian option for consuming omega-3s: “Those omega-3s are anti-inflammatory and literally part of the structure of healthy brain cells that face greater challenges as we get older.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans contain a variety of health-boosting nutrients, including plant-based protein, fiber and vitamins and minerals. They also contain polyphenols, plant-based compounds that have both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Beans are a staple in areas like the Blue Zones; they help regulate blood sugar and support a healthy gut,” says Shapiro.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Extra-virgin olive oil is a key ingredient in the Mediterranean diet. It is naturally rich in monounsaturated fat and polyphenols. Shapiro notes, “The combination of healthy fat and polyphenols supports healthy cholesterol levels and reduces inflammation.” The Food and Drug Administration supports eating 1.5 tablespoons (20 grams) of olive oil each day to help reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a plant-based source of omega-3 fatty acids and soluble fiber. “Clinical trials suggest eating chia seeds improves high cholesterol and high blood pressure, both of which contribute to accelerated signs of aging in midlife and older adulthood,” says Moon.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Prunes contain essential nutrients for keeping bones strong, including vitamin K, boron, calcium, magnesium and phenolic compounds. Moon says, “Prunes provide several nutrients that build strong bones, which is especially important for mobility and independence later in life; they have fiber and gut microbial byproducts that help bones absorb calcium.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, the fiber in prunes can support regular bowel movements and contribute to digestive health, notes Shapiro.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A plant-based source of vitamin B12, nutritional yeast adds a natural cheesy flavor without added fat or sodium. Having low levels of B12 can accelerate cellular aging, and higher rates of deficiency are seen among older people.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Shapiro recommends adding nutritional yeast to popcorn, salad dressings and grains as a replacement for foods high in saturated fat like cheese.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sharing conversation with a cup of tea is a nice way to connect with friends. Drinking tea can serve as a great tool for relaxing, too. But it is not just the act of drinking; green tea contains nutrients that can reduce stress and support cognitive health. Moon says, “Green tea provides bioactives known to promote blood flow to the part of the brain that helps us manage stress. It also has a blend of caffeine and L-theanine to help the brain stay alert but calm.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Small but mighty, herbs and spices add flavor and color to any meal. We love turmeric and parsley for their components which support brain and heart health. Moon says, “Turmeric’s active ingredient, curcumin, is part of the brain’s cleanup crew, sweeping away extra protein clumps that may lead to cognitive decline. Turmeric is associated with reduced cortisol and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which may be how it supports learning and memory.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moon also notes that consuming parsley as part of an overall healthy eating plan can provide flavonoids that are associated with a decrease in risk of stroke, a common contributing factor to cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tinned fish are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, essential fatty acids that play a role in reducing inflammation and supporting brain health. “Eating tinned fish once a week checks off one of the MIND diet guidelines, which overall has been associated with a 53% reduced risk of Alzheimer’s and a 7.5-year younger brain, as well as a slowdown in cognitive decline with aging.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shapiro notes that smaller fish, such as sardines, contain calcium in the bones. Calcium is an important nutrient for aging as it supports bone health. She also loves them for their convenience, cost and powerful anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Incorporate tinned fish into your salads, sandwiches or grains for a versatile, filling and nutrient-dense meal.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The USDA Dietary Guidelines recommend that &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; half of the grains you consume daily be whole grains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whole grains contain vitamins, minerals and fiber. Shapiro’s favorites are oats, quinoa and farro: “These provide fiber for gut health, B vitamins for energy, and steady-release carbohydrates to stabilize blood sugar and support long-term metabolic health.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to a nutritious diet, “A healthy lifestyle can help extend your lifespan by 8 to 10 years,” says Jiang. Daily movement is incredibly important for preserving lean body mass, bone health and balance. As we age, having strong muscles and bones can prevent falls. Shapiro says, “Include regular movement and activity into your day. Especially walking, strength training and mobility work, which support muscle mass, heart health and mental well-being.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Social connection can prevent loneliness and is another important lifestyle habit that can improve and increase your health span. “Prioritize connection and relationships. Strong social bonds and a sense of purpose are shown to promote longevity,” says Shapiro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_73-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_79-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Longevity refers to living a long life and enjoying quality of life throughout your years, including good health, independence and vitality. It is not just about adding years to your life, but adding life to your years,” says Shapiro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_80-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_81-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Get started by stocking your pantry with easy-to-use, convenient and affordable ingredients. Consuming pantry items that are rich in fiber, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids can contribute to overall health.

&lt;p&gt;Although people might not often talk about peeing-related problems, there are lots of common bladder health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incontinence (or ‘leaky bladder’) that accidentally loses urine when you don’t want it to is the most common bladder issue in individuals,” explained &lt;a href="https://yourfavoriteurologist.com/my-story/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879047" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Fenwa Milhouse&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified urologist and specialist in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery. “Frequent urination is also a very common complaint in individuals, and can be especially bothersome when this occurs at night or while sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interstitial cystitis, also known as painful bladder syndrome, is a long-term condition that causes pain and discomfort in the bladder, which is often irritated, or in the pelvic area. There’s also a sensation of needing to pee often and urgently. “When patients are experiencing overactive bladder or symptoms of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, our first recommendation is to limit bladder irritants,” Ackerman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that changing up your diet may reduce your issues. “Often diet alone and elimination of bladder irritants will control the patient’s symptoms,” Ackerman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you have a healthy bladder, knowing what foods and drinks are irritants will be beneficial. “Awareness of foods and beverages that can cause irritation can be helpful to prevent bladder symptoms for those that are not currently having concerns,” said &lt;a href="https://aeroflowurology.com/aleece-fosnight" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879047" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Aleece Fosnight&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified physician assistant specializing in women’s health and urology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, urologists and medical experts share the foods and drinks that you should limit or avoid for a healthy bladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love your morning cup or three of &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/coffee" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879047"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;? You may rely on it to wake up and stay alert, but your bladder may not be so happy. Coffee contains a couple of irritants ― caffeine and acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The caffeine in coffee is a known diuretic, meaning it makes you produce more urine, increasing bladder frequency,” Milhouse explained. “Caffeine has also been observed to increase the urgency of urination, making it harder to control your bladder and more likely to have bladder leaks.” Ackerman added that “acidic foods and drinks can be irritating and also exacerbate these symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you don’t want to give up your brew just yet, Milhouse said coffee and tea can be enjoyed in moderation. “If you have no bladder issues, two 8-ounce cups of coffee or less is ideal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who already deal with pain or frequent urination might need to limit or eliminate coffee until symptoms subside. “Avoiding coffee altogether may be necessary for some individuals who struggle with overactive bladder or bladder pain,” Milhouse said.&lt;/p&gt;

This study used data from the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, per &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/13/nx-s1-5393935/quarter-children-have-parent-substance-use-disorder-study"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Of those 19 million kids, 7.6 million have a parent with a moderate or severe addiction, and 3.4 million live with a parent dealing with multiple substance-use disorders. Authors also found that more than 6 million children have a parent dealing with both a substance use disorder and a mental health condition.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Most parental substance-use disorders identified in the study involve alcohol, which remains the main cause of substance-related deaths in the US, per Dr. Scott Hadland, adolescent medicine chief at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Experts say exposure to parental addiction can place children at increased risk for physical accidents, mental health conditions, and developing substance use problems themselves. Barriers to accessing care, including stigma, mean that most parents with a substance use disorder don't seek treatment.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Hadland notes that these findings mean pediatricians need to be especially vigilant in screening families and connecting them to treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine screening for substance use within families, and many clinics now ask about parental substance use as part of developmental screenings.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; The future of the survey from which the data was culled, meanwhile, is unclear following a recent workforce reduction. Per a &lt;a href="https://news.umich.edu/1-in-4-kids-live-with-parents-who-have-alcohol-other-drug-problems-u-m-study-finds/"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;, the survey's entire staff was laid off in April due to budget cuts at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (This content was created with the help of AI.

&lt;p&gt;They’re lovin’ it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People on TikTok are claiming that a specific &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/13/lifestyle/mcdonalds-launches-top-tier-new-mcflurry-flavor-to-celebrate-desserts-30th-anniversary-but-theres-a-catch/"&gt;McDonald’s order&lt;/a&gt; is helping cure their migraines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “migraine meal” is a large Coca-Cola drink and an order of large fries — and many&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/16/health/doctor-reveals-how-to-prevent-and-manage-headaches-migraine/"&gt; sufferers&lt;/a&gt; online can’t get enough of this combo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@millyhancockk/video/7503985153090342166" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;viral video&lt;/a&gt; — with over 3 million views — shows a girl at the fast food chain’s drive-thru with overlay text reading, “Trying McDonald’s chips [fries] and a Diet Coke because I’ve had a headache for 48 hours and TikTok said it would help.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the comments on the video chimed in praising this cure.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“I know it’s just the salt and caffeine but every time I have a migraine or even one coming on I get a coke and a fry and it’s immediately cured,” one person wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s my go to!! I take my migraine meds, sip a Diet Coke, and as my pain goes away, I crave salt…” a comment read.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not Diet Coke!!! Full sugar Coke + ibuprofen + something salty,” another person advised. &lt;/p&gt;

comment section of a viral TikTok video. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Diet Coke works on headaches, I don’t understand it , considering a coffee makes it worse,” a confused commenter chimed in, writing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any sort of “hack” — especially a health one — seen online always has to be taken with a grain of salt. However, this one in particular might be worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The caffeine in the Coke has pain relief properties, especially when used simultaneously with other pain relievers like ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know the caffeine can help migraines in the short-term therapy of them. So it isn’t too surprising that the caffeine in Coca-Cola itself is helpful,” Dr. David Walker, MD, told &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/mcmigraine-11727032" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Very Well Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rarely are people told that salty foods can actually do the body some good — but in this case, salty fries for the win.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Since migraines are often caused by “a deficiency of minerals such as sodium,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/mcdonalds-order-tiktok-claims-cure-163000602.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEjddFThkZVq_4U6uxRdal3PFd3FJQ33UoEwa5sB5SVtP14R14Q7tAM9XHtn-H10nmuvx-fimyzDJQagHrxLlbtY_81KOOGkdOhh27F62OlEoZ9W4OroUhUzo_r7yteqrBV9V3Sc_uEdkNRxl2_fjmIwOwQwg-wUwu5D91tr-LLn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Yahoo!

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that everyone’s body is different and migraines vary from person to person, so this hack night not be the cure-all for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This treat meal is not the worst idea from time to time, if it can help relieve a headache or migraine — just don’t make your McDonald’s run a habit. &lt;/p&gt;

The research found that these early experiences are not only linked to a child’s outcomes, but also shape the environment in which a child is raised—by affecting socioeconomic status, maternal mental health, relationship conflict, and caregiving behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers undertook this study to better understand how adversity experienced during a mother’s early years can ripple forward into the next generation. While previous studies have found that childhood adversity is associated with a range of negative outcomes in adulthood, much less is known about how these effects play out in parenting and early child development. The study aimed to test an intergenerational model of risk by examining both direct and indirect pathways from maternal childhood adversity to child outcomes during the preschool years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed 501 families from the time children were 2 months old until they reached 5 years of age. Participants were recruited in the Toronto area between 2006 and 2008. Mothers reported on their own adverse childhood experiences (including physical and sexual abuse, household substance use, mental illness, parental separation, and exposure to violence), as well as their current socioeconomic conditions, relationship conflict, and symptoms of depression. Fathers contributed information on their own childhood conduct problems, and trained observers assessed parenting behaviors. Children’s emotional and behavioral issues were rated by both parents, and cognitive abilities were measured through standardized testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that a mother’s history of childhood adversity was linked to her child’s emotional and behavioral problems, as well as cognitive performance. However, these associations were not straightforward. Instead, the effects were often indirect, operating through a network of interconnected family and contextual factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, mothers who had experienced more adversity in childhood were more likely to live in lower socioeconomic conditions as adults. This, in turn, was related to lower maternal sensitivity—how attuned and responsive mothers were to their children during interactions—and also linked to greater marital conflict and maternal depression. These factors shaped children’s outcomes in specific ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children’s emotional problems, such as anxiety and sadness, were primarily linked to maternal depression. Mothers with more childhood adversity were more likely to experience depression, and this was a key predictor of emotional difficulties in their children. Fathers’ histories of conduct problems also contributed indirectly to maternal depression, strengthening this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For conduct problems in children—such as aggression and rule-breaking—multiple pathways emerged. One involved fathers’ own histories of behavior problems, which were directly associated with children’s behavior. Another pathway went through the couple’s relationship: maternal childhood adversity predicted more marital conflict, which was in turn linked to conduct issues in children. Lower maternal sensitivity also played a role in this association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive outcomes followed a different pathway. Here, maternal sensitivity emerged as a key influence. Mothers with more childhood adversity tended to have lower socioeconomic status, which was associated with less sensitive caregiving. In turn, children in these environments showed poorer performance on measures of vocabulary and early math ability. Interestingly, maternal adversity showed a small direct link to higher child cognitive scores, but this was likely a statistical artifact. Once indirect pathways were considered, the overall effect of adversity on cognition was negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support an “interactionist model” of development. In this model, a mother’s early adversity can influence her adult socioeconomic status and the characteristics of her romantic partner, which then affect her mental health and caregiving behavior. These, in turn, shape her child’s development. The model highlights how early life experiences can create cascades of risk that accumulate over time and generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study cannot prove causation, its design strengthens confidence in the findings. By including multiple informants (mothers, fathers, and trained observers) and multiple measurement methods (questionnaires, behavioral observations, and standardized tests), the researchers were able to paint a more complete picture than many earlier studies that relied solely on maternal self-reports. The longitudinal design, spanning several years of a child’s early development, also allowed the researchers to track how these effects unfolded over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of the study is its focus on mothers. While the researchers did incorporate paternal conduct history, they did not collect data on fathers’ own childhood adversity. Future studies could explore whether fathers’ early experiences also shape intergenerational risk in similar or distinct ways. Another limitation is that the adversity measures did not include some potentially important forms of early trauma, such as community violence or discrimination. Also, maternal ACEs, mental health, and relationship conflict were all self-reported, which may introduce bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study has significant implications for public policy and early intervention. The findings suggest that childhood adversity is not just an individual problem but one that can affect future generations. Policies that aim to reduce childhood trauma or mitigate its effects could have broad, long-lasting benefits. For example, programs that support young families with financial resources, mental health services, and parenting support may help break the cycle of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening tools for adverse childhood experiences are relatively easy to administer and could be incorporated into pediatric and maternal healthcare settings. Identifying families at risk could allow for early, targeted support. Moreover, addressing multiple factors at once—such as economic hardship, caregiver mental health, and parenting quality—may be more effective than focusing on any single issue in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also supports the potential value of broader social policies, such as cash transfer programs, to alleviate economic stress. Preliminary research has found that unconditional financial support to families can lead to improved cognitive and behavioral outcomes in children. High-quality, affordable childcare may also help buffer the effects of family stress on young children’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.14118" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The long reach of adversity: Intermediary pathways from maternal adverse childhood experiences to child socio-emotional and cognitive outcomes&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sheri Madigan, Andre Plamondon, and Jennifer M.

Named CCR5 delta 32, the uncommon genetic variant disables a key immune protein used by a large majority of strains of the HIV virus to enter human cells and therefore “locks out” the virus in individuals who carry two copies of the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_50085" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50085" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50085" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-1.jpg" alt="Viking age DNA reveals 9,000-year-old HIV-resistant gene originating near the Black Sea" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-1.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-50085" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Reconstructed Viking village featuring traditional buildings and &lt;a class="wpg-linkify wpg-tooltip" title='&amp;lt;h3 class="wpg-tooltip-title"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class="wpg-tooltip-term-title"&amp;gt;Artifact&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class="wpg-tooltip-content"&amp;gt;An artifact or artefact (British English) refers to any portable object or material that has been created, modified, or used by humans.

These diverse forms may at times be mistaken for ecofacts and features, with all three often coexisting within archaeological sites.

Credit: Paolo Ghedini&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV is a relatively new disease. It was only identified in the last century, but the genetic mutation that defends against it has existed for thousands of years. The international research team, led by Professor Simon Rasmussen and senior researcher Kirstine Ravn of the University of Copenhagen’s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR), confirmed this through the analysis of over 3,000 genomes of ancient and modern humans. The study used a new AI-based method to detect the mutation in the often degraded DNA of ancient bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed DNA from more than 900 ancient people, ranging from the early Mesolithic era to the Viking era. They found that the CCR5 delta 32 mutation emerged abruptly and rapidly spread in human populations, particularly after humans transitioned from a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle to more densely settled agricultural societies. That shift in lifestyle likely put humans in contact with new pathogens, imposing evolutionary pressure that favored individuals with the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People with this mutation were better at surviving, likely because it dampened the immune system during a time when humans were exposed to new pathogens,” explained Leonardo Cobuccio, a co-author of the study and postdoctoral researcher at CBMR, in a statement. “While it might sound negative that the variation disrupts an immune gene, it was probably beneficial. An overly aggressive immune system can be deadly — think of allergic reactions or severe cases of viral infections like COVID-19, where the immune system often causes the damage that kills patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_50086" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50086" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-50086" data-src="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-2.jpg" alt="Viking age DNA reveals 9,000-year-old HIV-resistant gene originating near the Black Sea" data-srcset="https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-2.jpg 1280w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-2-300x223.jpg 300w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-2-1024x761.jpg 1024w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-2-768x571.jpg 768w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-2-150x111.jpg 150w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-2-750x557.jpg 750w, https://archaeologymag.com/wp-content/uploads/viking-dna-reveals-hiv-resistant-gene-2-1140x847.jpg 1140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-50086" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Layout featuring a colorized 3D print of an HIV virus particle (purple with green surface proteins).

Disabled by the delta 32 mutation, however, it becomes harder for HIV to infect these cells. This discovery has already been put to use in medicine: scientists have used the protective properties of the mutation to successfully treat a handful of HIV patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most fascinating findings of the research is that every modern carrier of this mutation, found in approximately 10 to 16 percent of Europeans, and up to 25 percent of Danes, probably descends from that single individual living around the Black Sea thousands of years ago. Previous hypotheses had suggested that the mutation had spread in response to more recent events such as the Black Death or Viking-era pandemics. The new genetic evidence, however, defies such a supposition and shows that the mutation became widespread between 8,000 and 2,000 years ago, long before such events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study redefines our understanding of how humans have learned to live with disease and demonstrates the power of combining ancient DNA and modern technology to uncover hidden pages of human history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ravn, K., Cobuccio, L., Muktupavela, R.

&lt;p&gt;“Broken heart syndrome” sounds poignant and poetic, but in reality, it’s a real and sometimes deadly condition. And while women are more likely to be diagnosed with it, men are more likely to die from it.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Formally known as &lt;em&gt;takotsubo cardiomyopathy&lt;/em&gt;, the syndrome mimics a heart attack—causing chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart muscle dysfunction—but without the clogged arteries. It’s typically triggered by a sudden surge of stress hormones after an emotional or physical event: a breakup, the death of a loved one, a major illness, or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;According to a new study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;, men hospitalized with broken heart syndrome die at more than &lt;strong&gt;twice the rate&lt;/strong&gt; of women. Researchers analyzed data from nearly 200,000 cases between 2016 and 2020. Around 11% of men died compared to just 5% of women.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“It seems to be a consistent finding that men don’t get takotsubo syndrome as much, but when they do, they do worse,” said Dr. Harmony Reynolds, a cardiologist at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-broken-heart-syndrome"&gt;What is Broken Heart Syndrome?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what’s going on? Part of it may be that men tend to experience the condition after more severe physical stress—like a stroke or surgery—whereas women often develop it following emotional trauma. “The people with emotional stressors actually do quite well,” said Dr. Ilan Wittstein of Johns Hopkins Medicine. “So it takes a more dangerous trigger to precipitate the syndrome [in men].”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Social support may also play a role. “If the stress is not gone, that’s probably going to continue to harm the heart,” said study author Dr. Mohammad Movahed, adding that men may have fewer outlets to manage that stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research, the condition still isn’t fully understood. Some scientists suspect certain people are just more vulnerable—due to things like high blood pressure, cholesterol, or even underlying vessel abnormalities. Estrogen may help protect women, but the hormonal link remains unclear. “We have not gotten there yet,” Reynolds said.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that treatment options are limited. “We have not found anything so far—any medication, any specific treatment—that can reduce complications or reduce mortality,” Movahed said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And because broken heart syndrome presents like a classic heart attack, doctors urge anyone with chest pain or shortness of breath to go straight to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002d3b751duddgsz@published"&gt;My boyfriend and I are at odds because he has grown out his beard and I refuse to have sex with him again until he gets rid of it. I think beards are gross—they are dirt magnets and I can’t stand the feel of them. I was at a sex party once and ended an encounter with a guy who was eating me out because the feel of his beard against my pussy was awful. My boyfriend says it’s his body, so it should be up to him. As far as I’m concerned, not if it causes me physical displeasure. That should give me the final say, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002g3b758eko15yu@published"&gt;In a sense you have the final say because you get to say no to sex for whatever reason. Your body, your choice. But the same principle applies to your boyfriend. If he wants a beard, he gets to have a beard. You have a good reason for wanting him to get rid of it: You find it uncomfortable during oral sex. But he has a good reason for wanting to keep it: He likes it. In the case of such a draw, it’s the body owner’s choice. The beard stays if he wants it to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002h3b751fyxb6ig@published"&gt;Now, your decision to refrain from sex may eventually win him to your side. One might call this manipulation, and maybe it is in some sense, but again, you have a valid reason for not wanting your bush to come in contact with his. Could you do stuff sexually anyway that &lt;em&gt;doesn’t &lt;/em&gt;involve beard-on-skin contact? Sure, but if things like kissing and oral are essential to your sex life, I can understand how that kind of activity would be much less attractive in light of his facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="183" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002i3b75f6zhv3ci@published"&gt;The problem with this kind of bargaining is that it might not be bargaining at all. It may lead to a stalemate. And then what? If you both hold out, neither of you win, per se, because you’re cutting off a presumably important part of your relationship. There can only be losers here. Maybe you wear him down and he relents and you’re happy and at least he’s getting laid. Maybe you never have sex again and decide to break up. I would encourage some kind of compromise here—perhaps you can find a length of beard that is beardy enough to satisfy his aesthetic purposes but not so beardy that it feels terrible against your vulva. Maybe he settles for a mustache or resolves to be the first guy in history to make a soul patch look cool. You should be willing to give at least a little here, as generosity is a good force to bring to the coupling and finding a mutually satisfying path forward is what you do in relationships. If you can’t, his beard may be an irreconcilable difference.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pa001z3b75tpg5bdel@published"&gt;There are a few subcategories of premature ejaculation. There’s lifelong PE and then there’s &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premature-ejaculation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354900"&gt;acquired PE&lt;/a&gt;—the latter is seen in people who previously had no sexual problems of this nature, like your husband. PE can have &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15627-premature-ejaculation"&gt;psychological roots&lt;/a&gt;—things like stress and anxiety can contribute, so if your husband has any new stressors or changes in his life, that may explain it. As the sexuality counselor Ian Kerner put it when I emailed him for &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/10/bi-boyfriend-piv-problem-advice.html"&gt;a past column&lt;/a&gt; about this issue, regarding acquired PE: “In almost all cases, the cause is performance anxiety which is governed by our sympathetic nervous system that mediates fight or flight response.” In other words, worrying about coming too fast can sometimes make it worse. And feeling guilty or ashamed about it can cause some people to rush through sex, exacerbating the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pa00203b754d8eikcu@published"&gt;Keep in mind that PE can also indicate physical issues like a hormonal problem or enlarged prostate. When someone sees a shift in sexual functioning—especially one this severe—it’s best to go see a doctor to make sure there isn’t an underlying health issue. Get your husband to the urologist as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

And then there is the stop-start method, which, much as it sounds, involves him penetrating for as long as he can without getting to the point of no return. As he approaches, he pulls out, takes a breather, and then continues. He repeats this as many times as possible. If those methods don’t work, sometimes a low dose of an SSRI is prescribed (since that class of drugs can delay ejaculation). A numbing spray may help, as may wearing a condom, though neither address the root cause of acquired PE, and might diminish his sensation in unenjoyable ways. Try any or all of these, and see &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/10/bi-boyfriend-piv-problem-advice.html"&gt;this past column&lt;/a&gt; for more in-depth advice on treating this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now you simply don’t know. Attempt to collect more information. Don’t badger her with requests. Instead, bring up how much you miss her head—they were the best you’ve ever had, which might feel good for her to know—and how much of an important feature of your sex life to you that it was. Why is she no longer into it, and is there anything you can do to help her get into it again? Perhaps it’s something you’ve been doing that turns her off—maybe she doesn’t like the way that you talk to her while she’s sucking you off, or maybe you’ve held her head in such a way that makes her uncomfortable. Maybe it’s not you at all but some kind of other external influence or inner voice.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pb00273b75ic9v9cl2@published"&gt;If she becomes uncomfortable during these conversations, back off for a little while and return again in a few weeks/months. Underscore the importance of blowjobs (though keep the drama out of the equation and avoid exaggerating terms like “heartsick” to describe your relationship to her head). You should also assess whether this indicates larger issues around sex or communication. Is your sex life otherwise perfect? Is she fully satisfied? Understand that things like this exist in context and your self-awareness may not be sharp as you think it is. You can always discuss joint sex counseling if you can’t get any clarity from her.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="126" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pb00283b75aoookn62@published"&gt;The fact is it’s your wife’s right to say no to anything. It’s her right to change her mind. You are not entitled to the blowjobs that she once gave you. You never were. I don’t think this is a matter of “convincing” her to give you head, I think this is an opportunity to seek more information and bolster your communication. Once things are clearer, you still must take no for an answer, but at the very least maybe your wife could help you come up with a satisfying alternative path to your own satisfaction. Does she really think that you should live the rest of your life without blowjobs? The answer to that may be illuminating and help you figure out potential next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On one visit, she asked for a blood test and the doctor turned her away, telling her that she was depressed and gave her a number to call for support. “I couldn’t believe that I wasn’t being listened to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t think I had depression and I was worried because I felt as if my brain was getting slower, and in all honesty, dumber. I hated getting that ‘stuck in my throat’ moment when words were lost to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, she didn’t take any long-term leave from work but had more sick days compared to colleagues. “My immune system was so rubbish that I would catch every single bug under the sun and I would be ill all the time – it was so frustrating and I just couldn’t work out what was wrong,” Ford says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At one desperate point, I thought that it could just be me – maybe I was just lazy and couldn’t cope with a full-time job. I felt like I was crazy. I knew I had all these symptoms but all the medical professionals were brushing them off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Finally, a diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 18 months after first seeking help, when she was 22, Ford saw a female GP. “I walked into the appointment and as I sat down, she asked me what was wrong and I just burst into tears,” she recalls. “She listened to me and said she thought I needed a full blood count to determine what was wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the turning point because, four days later, the results came back and showed she had severe hypothyroidism, also known as an underactive thyroid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a condition that affects 1-2 per cent of the population and is more common in women than men. It occurs when the immune system attacks the thyroid glands – a small gland in the neck, shaped like a butterfly or bow tie, just in front of the windpipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the thyroid can’t make enough of the hormone thyroxine (also called T4), which is responsible for regulating metabolism (the chemical reactions in our body), explains Dr Nicola Zammitt, a consultant endocrinologist in Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiredness is one of the main symptoms of hypothyroidism. “It feels like there isn’t enough gas in the tank,” she says. “Everything’s slowed down too much. There’s a tendency to put on weight, to feel the cold more and your bowels slow down, so people tend to be constipated,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms include depression, slow movements and thoughts, muscle aches and weakness, dry and scaly skin, brittle hair and nails, a loss of libido, pain and numbness in the hands and fingers, as well as irregular or heavy periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The diagnosis was a massive relief and made so much sense,” Ford says. “It confirmed that I really was ill and that it wasn’t just in my head and, most importantly, it meant that I could be treated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why hypothyroidism is so difficult to spot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ford’s road to diagnosis was long, it shouldn’t have to be. “Confirming a diagnosis of hypothyroidism is straightforward and involves a simple, cheap blood test that any GP is able to do,” explains Dr Zammitt, who is also a trustee for the British Thyroid Foundation. The blood sample then goes to a biochemistry lab and results show whether a thyroid is working normally, is underactive or overactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it can be difficult for doctors to spot that a patient’s symptoms are a result of a thyroid problem, and refer them for this test, she notes. This is because the main symptom – tiredness – is a common symptom of many illnesses, meaning it can sometimes take a while for patients to be diagnosed, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other tell-tale sign of hypothyroidism is weight gain and most cases of hypothyroidism occur in midlife. “So, imagine a woman in her 40s or 50s saying that she’s put on weight and is feeling sluggish – very often, doctors will think these are simply symptoms of the menopause,” Dr Zammitt notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While hypothyroidism can occur at any age, most cases are among the over-50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common cause is autoimmune disease, where antibodies (cells produced by the immune system to fight off infection) mistakenly attack the thyroid gland, damaging it, Dr Zammitt says. Doctors don’t yet know what causes the immune system to overreact in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some babies are born with an underactive thyroid, which is called congenital hypothyroidism (which all babies in the UK are screened for within the first few weeks of life), but this is relatively uncommon, Dr Zammitt notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Living with hypothyroidism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can’t cure hypothyroidism, Ford takes a medication called T4 levothyroxine. It’s a daily tablet that replaces the thyroxine that her body can’t make enough of on its own and reduces the severity of her brain fog, tiredness and other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I still have flare-ups,” she notes. “I don’t know what causes them – it could just be a bug – but I’m just really rubbish on those days. I feel slow and I find it really hard to talk. The brain fog will get so bad that I just cannot function. It really gets me down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford still works a full-time job, has a four-year-old son and is also a newly published author, finding solace in writing as something she could do, even when she felt short of energy. Her first novel &lt;em&gt;Work Trip&lt;/em&gt; – a rom-com that sees two colleagues who dislike each other forced together while travelling for work – is out now, and she has another book out in October called &lt;em&gt;House Party&lt;/em&gt;. “I’m not very good at practising rest,” she admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My experience has left me wondering how many people suffer with thyroid issues for a long time without realising the cause, or that there are treatments available,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There main consequences of an undiagnosed underactive thyroid relate to symptoms going untreated, as it can lead to high cholesterol, which raises the risk of heart disease and strokes, Dr Zammitt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of treatment can also lead to a rare complication called myxoedema, which is a severely underactive thyroid that can cause the heart rate, body temperature and sodium levels to become worryingly low, she notes. Symptoms of myxoedema include confusion and a drop in alertness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An untreated thyroid can ultimately lead to hospitalisation, intensive care and even death, though this is extremely uncommon as most people would get a diagnosis and take their medication to prevent these complications,” Dr Zammitt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have autoimmune hypothyroidism are also slightly more likely to develop other autoimmune conditions, such as &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/type-1-diabetes-what-are-the-signs-and-how-to-treat-it/"&gt;Type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, coeliac disease or Addison’s disease, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people who have an underactive thyroid, or have undiagnosed symptoms, my biggest piece of advice would be to advocate for yourself,” Ford says. “I know it can be easier said than done but push for appointments and tests when things don’t feel right but keep pushing until you get the care you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, while it’s a condition that you’re going to have forever, it’s not all doom and gloom. You can hold down a job, have a family and even turn a hobby into a new career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Hypothyroidism FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;What does our thyroid gland do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thyroid gland sits in the lower part of the neck and is shaped a little bit like a bow tie or butterfly, explains Dr Zammitt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S. and has multiple causes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing sunscreen and avoiding excess sun exposure are the best protection. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research shows antioxidants may also help guard against this common cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spending time outside can boost your mood, promote better sleep and support your immune system (plus, it’s free!). The only drawback is that outdoor time also exposes you to the sun’s skin-damaging UV rays. Over time, that could set the stage for skin cancer, the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “By far, the top risk factor for developing skin cancer is unprotected UV exposure, followed by genetic predisposition,” says dermatologist &lt;a href="https://facetdermatology.com/en-us/pages/our-team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Geeta Yadav, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is good news, though. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  many cases of skin cancer are largely preventable. Adopting safe sun habits like applying a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913195/best-reef-safe-sunscreens/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;broad-spectrum sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;, wearing a hat, sunglasses and clothes that cover your arms and legs, and staying in the shade can all lower your UV exposure and significantly reduce your risk. So can avoiding tanning beds, which also emit large amounts of UV light.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also bolster your skin’s defenses from the inside out by eating more antioxidants. While diet plays a smaller role in skin cancer prevention, research reveals that antioxidants can provide additional protection to safeguard your skin from this all-too-common cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Skin cancer occurs when abnormal skin cells develop in the skin’s outermost layer, called the epidermis. What causes those abnormal cells to develop and grow? The most common cause is DNA damage from exposure to UV rays, either from the sun or tanning beds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, there are other risk factors too, like getting older or having a family history of skin cancer. You may also be more likely to develop skin cancer if you have blue or green eyes, red or blond hair or have skin that’s fair or burns or freckles easily. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, most of these risk factors are beyond your control. But there is one helpful step you can take, and that’s eating an antioxidant-rich diet. In fact, research has found that dietary &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054507/best-antioxidant-rich-anti-inflammatory-fruits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; can help counteract some of the damage caused by UV exposure before it turns into cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And the list is long: selenium, zinc, copper, carotenoids, polyphenols and vitamins A, C and E may all be protective, according to research. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Combat Oxidative Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exposure to UV light sets off a chain reaction that creates a storm of skin-damaging compounds called free radicals. That’s where antioxidants step in. “Antioxidants combat free radicals, unstable molecules that can damage cells and their DNA, proteins and lipids,” says Yadav. “When there are too many free radicals in the body to the point that antioxidants cannot help neutralize them, oxidative stress occurs, leading to cellular dysfunction. This dysfunction could manifest as early signs of aging, but it could also manifest as cancer”.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Regularly consuming antioxidant-rich foods equips your body with the defenders needed to neutralize those free radicals before they cause long-term harm. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They May Prevent the Spread of Cancerous Cells &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all DNA damage leads to cancer. In fact, our bodies have a natural defense mechanism to kill off DNA-damaged cells before they turn cancerous and start to spread.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s not fool-proof, and some damage can fall through the cracks. Fortunately, research reveals that antioxidants called anthocyanins may help speed the process. While anthocyanins are found in lots of fruits and vegetables, one of the best sources for skin protection is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/22787/ingredients/fruit/berries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;. So, load up on these juicy fruits for an extra dose of prevention.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sunburns aren’t just painful. This inflammatory reaction in your skin can cause long-lasting damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Enter &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053196/foods-skin-protection-sun-damage/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;. Research has found that they help absorb some of the sun’s harmful UV rays and reduce inflammation to decrease the development of sunburn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For instance, one study found that carotenoids, antioxidants found in yellow, orange and red fruits and vegetables, could provide the equivalent sun protection to SPF 4 sunscreen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For the biggest bang, think tomatoes. They’re filled with a carotenoid called lycopene that’s been shown to guard against sun damage from the inside out.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat the Rainbow:&lt;/strong&gt; An easy rule of thumb for adding &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;more antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; to your diet is to add more color to your plate. Fruits and vegetables with bright, deep hues are often the richest source of these beneficial compounds. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brew a Cup of Green Tea&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a reason green tea is added to face creams, masks and serums. It’s rich in antioxidants called catechins that have been shown to calm UV-related skin inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savor Some Dark Chocolate: &lt;/strong&gt;While chocolate may not prevent skin cancer, it contains inflammation-taming antioxidants called polyphenols that may improve skin hydration and circulation. Since dark chocolate contains the most polyphenols, the darker the chocolate, the better!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting regular skin checks and practicing safe sun habits like applying sunscreen, wearing a hat and protective clothing, and staying in the shade may all help reduce your risk of skin cancer. While diet plays a much smaller role, research has found that antioxidants may offer additional protection. Antioxidants are believed to combat cancer-causing oxidative stress, slow the spread of cancer cells and boost your body’s internal defenses against inflammation and sunburn. And the best way to get more of them isn’t a pill or powder. It’s a diet rich in colorful fruits and vegetables. So, before you hit the beach, park or pool, head to the produce aisle!&lt;br&gt;

In a rat model mimicking human exercise, scientists found that dopamine and noradrenaline levels increased in the hippocampus during low-intensity activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neurotransmitters were traced back to specific brainstem regions, the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus, which also showed activation. The more these regions were stimulated, the more hippocampal neurons were activated, pointing to a clear link between light movement and improved brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurochemical Surge:&lt;/strong&gt; Light exercise increases dopamine and noradrenaline in the hippocampus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brainstem Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Activity in the VTA and locus coeruleus correlated with memory-related brain areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support light exercise as a powerful tool for enhancing brain plasticity and memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Tsukuba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent studies have found that light exercise, such as light jogging and yoga, activate the hippocampus, thereby increasing the number of neurons and improving memory. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the details of the mechanisms involved, the specific neural circuits activated in the brain during exercise, and the way they activate neurons in the hippocampus are not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110099"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce.jpg" alt="This shows a person running and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-synaptic-plasticity-neurosciecnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dopamine and noradrenaline levels increased in the hippocampus, even with light exercise. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin, collectively known as monoamines, are critical neurotransmitters that regulate neuronal activity and plasticity and are produced by neurons that cluster in the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monoamines transmitted to the hippocampus promote neuronal and synaptic plasticity, contributing to the regulation of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this research team hypothesized that the monoaminergic system originating in the brainstem may contribute to hippocampal activation during light exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, this study established a rat treadmill running model that mimicked the physiological responses in human exercise to evaluate the effects of exercise at different intensities on hippocampal monoamine concentrations and the activation of brainstem monoaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine and noradrenaline levels increased in the hippocampus, even with light exercise.

Participants who listened to emotionally charged music while recalling neutral stories later remembered those stories with emotional tones matching the music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These emotional updates persisted over time, demonstrating that music can influence the emotional reconstruction of memory. Brain scans showed increased activity and connectivity in emotion- and memory-related regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus, during music-paired recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Rewriting:&lt;/strong&gt; Emotional music played during recollection altered the remembered emotional tone of otherwise neutral stories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; One day later, participants still recalled the stories with emotional content matching the music’s valence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; fMRI showed increased amygdala activity and connectivity with frontal and visual areas during emotional music recollection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music doesn’t just move us—it may also reshape the emotions we associate with past experiences, according to a new neuroscience study. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that playing emotional music during memory recollection can subtly alter the content of that memory, effectively updating its emotional tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes aren’t just fleeting impressions; they can persist for days and are reflected in the brain’s emotional and memory networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the well-established theory that memories can be updated each time they are retrieved, scientists designed a three-day experiment to explore how music might influence this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants first encoded emotionally neutral stories. Later, they were asked to recall those stories while listening to either emotionally positive or negative music. Finally, they were tested again a day later, without music, to see how their memories had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Participants who recalled stories while listening to emotional music were significantly more likely to infuse their recollections with new emotional content that matched the tone of the music—happy music led to more positive reinterpretations, while sad music prompted more negative ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When tested a day later, these emotional distortions had persisted, showing that music had effectively rewritten the emotional tone of the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging during recollection showed activity in emotion- and memory-related regions, including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus, and inferior parietal lobule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, emotional music increased connectivity between the amygdala and both the frontal cortex and visual processing areas, suggesting that the brain was integrating emotional tone with visual imagery and narrative structure during recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings shed new light on the powerful influence of music on the mind. While music’s ability to evoke emotional responses is well known, this study shows it can actively change what we remember and how we feel about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has potential implications for everything from therapeutic memory reconsolidation to understanding the emotional coloring of autobiographical memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re reminiscing to a nostalgic playlist or reliving heartbreak through song, your soundtrack may be shaping your memories more than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music and emotional memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-024-01200-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Affective music during episodic memory recollection modulates subsequent false emotional memory traces: an fMRI study&lt;/a&gt;” by Yiren Ren et al. &lt;em&gt;Cognitive, Affective, &amp;amp; Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affective music during episodic memory recollection modulates subsequent false emotional memory traces: an fMRI study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music is a powerful medium that influences our emotions and memories. Neuroscience research has demonstrated music’s ability to engage brain regions associated with emotion, reward, motivation, and autobiographical memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While music’s role in modulating emotions has been explored extensively, our study investigates whether music can alter the emotional content of memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the theory that memories can be updated upon retrieval, we tested whether introducing emotional music during memory recollection might introduce false emotional elements into the original memory trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a 3-day episodic memory task with separate encoding, recollection, and retrieval phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our primary hypothesis was that emotional music played during memory recollection would increase the likelihood of introducing novel emotional components into the original memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral findings revealed two key outcomes: 1) participants exposed to music during memory recollection were more likely to incorporate novel emotional components congruent with the paired music valence, and 2) memories retrieved 1 day later exhibited a stronger emotional tone than the original memory, congruent with the valence of the music paired during the previous day’s recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, fMRI results revealed altered neural engagement during story recollection with music, including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus, and inferior parietal lobule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced connectivity between the amygdala and other brain regions, including the frontal and visual cortex, was observed during recollection with music, potentially contributing to more emotionally charged story reconstructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings illuminate the interplay between music, emotion, and memory, offering insights into the consequences of infusing emotional music into memory recollection processes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 13:57:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFBpeDFqYl9vRmVOZFN0MTZWNDVZX2sycC0wN2xUbnVfZ2lpTEkwa2ZNZXB2OWtPZzBzcWtKRkN4Ylpkc2MwLXhQLVhvc1BIT2Fhc2Jqc1htQ3kxaGdjcTZDUjV2amFXMVBmX0E</guid></item><item><title>果蝇研究表明，神经胶质细胞可能在管理睡眠和新陈代谢方面发挥关键作用- Medical Xpress | Glial cells may play key role in managing sleep and metabolism, fruit fly study suggests - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFBKeGhRNzRRT0hxMncyS3gtRnRiWkNYczhoYXYzOVluZUFkTEtMZ1VyQ2dsWVBTMDEzYlZxcU5JYUdOeDhRT0NLX05DWFJrbHdzQkR1dUxjX3lYZWRrQmhycllmMngxQmhHUzVCbmJEUUNPMWFKam9wcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeostasis is the ability of living organisms to maintain stable internal conditions, such as temperature, hydration and blood sugar levels, irrespective of any changes in their surroundings. Homeostatic mechanisms also regulate behaviors that are central to the survival of animal species, such as sleep, rest and eating.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology of Behavior–Caesar (MPINB) in Germany recently carried out a study aimed at better understanding the neural underpinnings of rest, sleep and feeding behavior in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01942-1" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, highlight the key role of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/glia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;glia&lt;/a&gt; (non-&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neuronal+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neuronal cells&lt;/a&gt; in the brain and nervous system with different specialized functions) in regulating these vital mechanisms in fruit flies, suggesting that they serve as metabolic homeostats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Humans spend about a third of their lives sleeping, yet we still don't fully understand why sleep is necessary," Andres Flores-Valle, first author of the paper, told Medical Xpress "Our research aims to answer this question by studying fruit flies, which despite having much simpler brains, also sleep. Their simplicity and the powerful genetic tools available make them ideal for understanding the basic functions of sleep."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of their recent study, Flores-Valle and his colleagues specifically set out to uncover a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+signal/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain signal&lt;/a&gt; that tracks the need for sleep (i.e., sleep homeostasis) in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fruit+flies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fruit flies&lt;/a&gt;. This signal should increase as a fly becomes more tired and reset after a period of restful sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the mechanisms behind sleep homeostasis can potentially provide answers for why sleep is necessary," explained Flores-Valle. "We used in vivo imaging to record glial and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural activity&lt;/a&gt; in awake and sleeping flies under a microscope," explained Flores-Valle.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"To do this, we kept flies comfortable and fed them every few hours using a robot. We did this over several days, allowing them to sleep naturally under the microscope."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their experiments, the researchers examined two distinct types of glia cells, known as astrocyte-like glia and ensheathing glia. The first are known to serve similar functions to astrocytes, thus helping to maintain a stable chemical environment in the brain. The second are cells that wrap around axons, contributing to their regeneration and to the removal of axon residues or damaged cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, Flores-Valle and his colleagues were the first to record the brain activity of flies for extended periods, while also ensuring their comfort during rest. The experimental methods they employed ultimately allowed them to intermittently observe the insects while they were asleep and awake.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that glial cells track sleep need through calcium signals that rise during wakefulness and reset with sleep," said Flores-Valle. "Surprisingly, we discovered that neurons thought to trigger sleep instead tracked feeding need, with activity rising until the fly eats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also found that glial calcium activity is linked to metabolism—helping clear CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and regulate pH- suggesting sleep may be needed to restore metabolic balance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings gathered by the researchers show that glial cells respond to metabolic signals and these responses influence their calcium activity. Overall, these results link the activity of glial cells to metabolic states and the regulation of sleep. In the future, they could inspire further research focusing on the contribution of glia to sleep, which could also improve the understanding of sleep and metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our next studies will try to uncover how &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/glial+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;glial cells&lt;/a&gt; trigger the transition from wakefulness to sleep, a key question that remains unanswered," added Flores-Valle. "We suspect that elevated calcium activity in glia after prolonged wakefulness helps initiate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sleep/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, but how the signal acts across the brain is still unknown."&lt;/p&gt;

Even among those who exercise regularly, spending more time sitting was associated with worse cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was strongest in individuals carrying the APOE-e4 gene, a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s. These findings suggest that breaking up sedentary time throughout the day may be a key strategy for protecting brain health and reducing Alzheimer’s risk, especially in genetically vulnerable individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent of Exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; More sitting led to cognitive decline even in regular exercisers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Risk Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were more pronounced in APOE-e4 carriers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Sedentary behavior was associated with brain shrinkage over 7 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over 6 million Americans are impacted by Alzheimer’s disease, and researchers from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh are discovering how lifestyle habits can impact the likelihood of developing the disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a new research study published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;, researchers found that increased sedentary behavior, time spent sitting or lying down, in aging adults was associated with worse cognition and brain shrinkage in areas related to risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110091"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man sitting and brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These conclusions were stronger in participants who carried the APOE-e4 allele, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that reducing sedentary time may be especially important for older adults who are at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research study was led by Marissa Gogniat, PhD, assistant professor of Neurology at Pitt and former postdoctoral fellow at the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer’s Center, and co-authored by Angela Jefferson, PhD, professor of Neurology and founding director of the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer’s Center at VUMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team of researchers examined the relationship between sedentary behavior and neurodegeneration among 404 adults age 50 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants wore a watch that measured their activity continuously over the span of a week. Their sedentary time was then related to their cognitive performance and brain scans captured over a seven-year follow-up period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who spent more time sedentary were more likely to experience cognitive decline and neurodegenerative changes regardless of how much they exercised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conclusions were stronger in participants who carried the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;APOE-e4&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;allele, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that reducing sedentary time may be especially important for older adults who are at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease is not just about working out once a day,” said Gogniat. “Minimizing the time spent sitting, even if you do exercise daily, reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is critical to study lifestyle choices and the impact they have on brain health as we age,” said Jefferson, who holds the Herbert O. and Vineta Christopher Directorship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study showed that reducing sitting time could be a promising strategy for preventing neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research highlights the importance of reducing sitting time, particularly among aging adults at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. It is critical to our brain health to take breaks from sitting throughout the day and move around to increase our active time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Alzheimer’s Association and the National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sedentary behavior and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3a0b1a2aaa4eda1aca6b1ada6b183b5b6aea0edacb1a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Craig Boerner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vumc.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Craig Boerner – Vanderbilt University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Increased sedentary behavior is associated with neurodegeneration and worse cognition in older adults over a 7-year period despite high levels of physical activity&lt;/a&gt;” by Marissa Gogniat et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased sedentary behavior is associated with neurodegeneration and worse cognition in older adults over a 7-year period despite high levels of physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70157-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sedentary behavior may be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Cross-sectional and longitudinal linear regressions examined sedentary time in relation to brain structure and cognition.

Associations differed by &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;-ε4 status.

More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; got a good thing going.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;getty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In too many areas of life, we’re inclined to search for negatives before we do positives. When we’re looking for a new TV show, movie or book, we look at the bad reviews before we do the good ones. We’re more likely to remember the one rude email we received at work than the five friendly ones that succeeded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, even our relationships fall prey to this pattern of pessimism. We point out weaknesses, in the relationship or even within our partner, more easily than we can point out their strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is human instinct; it’s rooted in our DNA to do whatever we can to protect ourselves. The problem, however, is that this survival mechanism is difficult to switch off. That is, we forget that there comes a point where we can &lt;em&gt;stop &lt;/em&gt;looking for dangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just as our brains can be trained to scan for threats, they can also be retrained to look towards the good. Making a conscious effort to recognize what’s going right in your relationship — and in your partner — can transform the way you see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of optimism, here are three signs that your partner is a real keeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. They ‘Match Your Energy’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloquially, we often see people refer to the importance of a partner being able to “match your energy” — to be excited when you’re excited, or to feel your sadness in the same way they would their own. While the terminology might not be scientific, there’s ample research that lends support to the idea as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In psychology, “matching someone’s energy” would be conceptualized as “compersion.” According to a 2023 &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-031-08956-5_2472-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-031-08956-5_2472-1" aria-label="reference"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-031-08956-5_2472-1"&gt;reference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopedia of Sexual Psychology and Behavior&lt;/em&gt;, compersion refers to the range of positive emotions one experiences in relation to those of another. In simpler terms, it could be understood as the opposite of jealousy: feeling happy when you witness your partner’s happiness, as opposed to feeling threatened by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Matching energy,” in this sense, is indeed a very positive indicator in a romantic relationship. In fact, a 2024 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/emo0001466" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1037/emo0001466" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1037/emo0001466"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt; notes that greater “smile synchrony (that is, how frequently and quickly partners return one another’s smiles) is associated with greater relationship satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing more discouraging than getting excited about something, only to be met with a blank stare, lukewarm indifference or a dismissive comment. Even if they don’t mean to, incongruencies like these can make you feel incredibly small and silly. So if your partner is able to share in your joy with genuine enthusiasm, you’ve definitely got a keeper.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Maybe you just read a fascinating article about penguin parenting habits, or perhaps you finally beat that impossible boss level in your favorite video game. Whatever it is, you should never feel like you have to downplay your excitement to be taken seriously. If your partner can &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2025/02/08/1-subtle-sign-that-your-relationship-is-thriving-from-a-psychologist/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2025/02/08/1-subtle-sign-that-your-relationship-is-thriving-from-a-psychologist/" target="_self" aria-label="light up, laugh or celebrate right along with you"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2025/02/08/1-subtle-sign-that-your-relationship-is-thriving-from-a-psychologist/"&gt;light up, laugh or celebrate right along with you&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — regardless of how trivial or offbeat the moment may seem — then they’re definitely waving a green flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They Always Take Your Side&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most tell-tale signs that you’re in a healthy, lasting relationship is knowing that your partner will take your side when it really matters. It could be during tense moments with in-laws, standing up for you when your own family tends to dismiss your feelings or even offering support during disagreements within the relationship itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In too many of these scenarios, people end up feeling like they’re fending for themselves, alone. But in a secure partnership, that should never be the case. No matter how complicated or uncomfortable the situation may be, you should feel that, at the very least, your partner will always have your back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unwavering support like this is especially crucial for people who tend to feel insecure or anxious in close relationships. Stressful situations involving criticism, exclusion or emotional conflict can hit home for them. Without someone in their corner, they may feel the need to defend themselves, shut down or lash out in ways they’ll regret later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In psychology, this is known as “partner buffering.” As 2020 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186880" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186880" aria-label="research"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186880"&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explains, this refers to one partner’s ability to help regulate the other’s emotions during times of distress. Sometimes this looks like stepping in to de-escalate a conflict. Other times, it’s simply about reassuring their partner that they’re not alone and that someone’s on their side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe your in-laws are making subtle digs at you over dinner. Maybe your family mentions that one childhood memory that you’ve asked them to stop bringing up. Or maybe it’s something as light as a board game night where things unexpectedly became heated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your partner is willing to &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/21/3-traits-that-define-a-supportive-partner-from-a-psychologist/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/21/3-traits-that-define-a-supportive-partner-from-a-psychologist/" target="_self" aria-label="firmly stand by you"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/21/3-traits-that-define-a-supportive-partner-from-a-psychologist/"&gt;firmly stand by you&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in these moments — to validate your emotions and speak up when no one else does — then you’re in a relationship that most people can only dream of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They Do Things Without You Asking Them To&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an unfortunate truth that, in many relationships, one partner ends up having to constantly remind the other of their needs — and often, these are just the basics. But when they speak up, they’re too often labeled as “needy” or accused of “nagging.” But, in reality, it’s nowhere near unreasonable to expect effort from someone you share your life with. You shouldn’t have to convince your partner to show up for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthy relationships, however, this is never the case. There’s no scoreboard, nor a need to repeatedly spell things out. In fact, 2019 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.08.018" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.08.018" aria-label="research"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.08.018"&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/em&gt; notes that choosing an altruistic partner — someone who genuinely cares about your well-being without expecting anything in return — is a smart, successful mate choice. In other words, choosing someone who consistently shows up for you &lt;em&gt;just because they want to&lt;/em&gt; is one of the strongest predictors of long-term relationship satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to ask them to put their phone down while you’re talking. You don’t need to chase them to pick up after themselves. And beyond these bare necessities, you don’t need to ask for them for love or kindness. It’s already part of their routine, and they do it without hesitation or resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they come home from the grocery store with your favorite snack or a bouquet of flowers, just because. Maybe they quietly start rubbing your shoulders after a long day without needing to be prompted. Or maybe they simply do the little things they know make you smile, without expecting praise, recognition or anything in return. This kind of &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/10/26/a-psychologist-shares-4-love-styles-found-in-strong-marriages/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/10/26/a-psychologist-shares-4-love-styles-found-in-strong-marriages/" target="_self" aria-label="selfless love"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/10/26/a-psychologist-shares-4-love-styles-found-in-strong-marriages/"&gt;selfless love&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is something only a rare few get to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if your partner ticks &lt;em&gt;all three&lt;/em&gt; of the boxes above — if they match your energy, have your back when it counts and show up without being asked — you probably already know you’ve got something special. But if you didn’t know it before reading this, let this be your sign: they’re a keeper.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;New research has shown how the parasitic amoeba &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba_histolytica"&gt;Entamoeba histolytica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; takes bites from your cells to use as a disguise, hiding them from the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entering the body via contaminated food or water, most infections from the parasite cause diarrhea, if any symptoms at all. In particularly bad cases, the amoeba can spread via the bloodstream to other vital organs, where it can cause serious problems. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the infection reaches the liver, for instance, the amoebic abscesses it creates can be fatal, causing complications that claim the lives of almost 70,000 people each year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;this tiny monster wreaks such havoc in its host was largely unknown, until microbiologist Katherine Ralston – currently at the University of California Davis, but back then posted at the University of Virginia – investigated the amoeba more closely in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The going theory was that &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica &lt;/em&gt;injected a poison into its victim cells. But Ralston &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13242"&gt;saw something very different&lt;/a&gt; going on through her microscope. &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica &lt;/em&gt;was taking what looked like actual bites out of human cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"To devise new therapies or vaccines, you really need to know how &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica&lt;/em&gt; damages tissue," Ralston &lt;a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/wily-parasite-kills-human-cells-and-wears-their-remains-disguise"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You could see little parts of the human cell being broken off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stranger still, the amoeba &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.03163-21"&gt;seemed satisfied&lt;/a&gt; with just a few chomps from each cell's membrane before moving on to its next victim, leaving in its wake a slew of half-chewed cells with cytoplasms oozing from their puncture wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It can kill anything you throw at it, any kind of human cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;," Ralston &lt;a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/wily-parasite-kills-human-cells-and-wears-their-remains-disguise"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. It can even take a chomp out of the white blood cells that are meant to swallow such intruders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161309" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161309" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Amebiasis_LifeCycle_lg.jpg" alt="diagram shows amebiases life cycle involves mature cysts ingested, entering intestine and possibly other parts of the body, and then cysts and trophozyoites are passed in feces.

Cysts can survive days to weeks in the external environment and remain infectious in the environment due to the protection conferred by their walls. (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/amebiasis/index.html"&gt;DPDx/CDC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Ralston and her colleagues &lt;span&gt;Maura Ruyechan and Wesley Huang have discovered t&lt;/span&gt;his seemingly wasteful habit actually allows &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica&lt;/em&gt; to gather outer membrane proteins from the human cells, which it proceeds to arrange on the surface of its own body for protection against defences in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this disguise doesn't just protect it from human immune 'guards': it works on immune responses present in the blood of other species, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It has become clear that amoebae kill human cells by performing cell nibbling, known as trogocytosis," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.04.616735"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;. "After performing trogocytosis, amoebae display human proteins on their own surface and are resistant to lysis [rupture] by human serum [a component of blood]."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This molecular disguise prevents our immune system from launching an attack on the amoeba by presenting chemical tags that identify it as safe, a bit like stealing the ID off a security guard. When &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica &lt;/em&gt;dons the human proteins CD46 and CD55, it can safely scoot past the &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'complement proteins' tasked with tracking down and destroying foreign cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This allows it to continue chomping away, forming abscesses full of liquified cells in the organs it inhabits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the team conducted an experiment in which they allowed the amoeba to collect material from human cells before exposing the 'disguised' parasites to mouse blood serum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although mice are not a natural host of &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica,&lt;/em&gt; experimental infection of mice with amoebae mimics many aspects of the human infection, ranging from immune responses to the host genetic determinants of susceptibility to infection," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.04.616735"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its camouflage was effective despite originating from an entirely different species, reflecting similarities between human and mouse complement protein security systems. This knowledge will allow the researchers to further investigate treatments and vaccines for the amoeba using mouse models, before proceeding to human trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science is a process of building&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;," Ralston &lt;a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/wily-parasite-kills-human-cells-and-wears-their-remains-disguise"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You have to build one tool upon another, until you're finally ready to discover new treatments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research has not yet been peer-reviewed, but it is available as a pre-print in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.04.616735"&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Every new “surprise” – from not being able to use tampons, to an almost constant cycle of UTIs – felt all the worse for my lack of mental and practical preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This shouldn’t be the case: around a half of all women will have some degree of pelvic organ prolapse in their lifetime. There are four types: vaginal, uterine, bladder and rectal, all of which involve one or more pelvic organs descending into the vagina. Often, it creates an internal bulge, but when it is more progressed it can be externally visible too. Prolapse being so varied – and, crucially, understudied – makes for a great proliferation of potential symptoms which are, in my opinion, generally underplayed in healthcare literature. Living with an organ descending into your vagina is frequently described as “uncomfortable”, as though comparable to wearing a too small pair of jeans. The NHS website describes what can be truly debilitating stress urinary incontinence (SUI) as “&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pelvic-organ-prolapse/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;problems [with] peeing&lt;/a&gt;”. What little information is available on prolapse seems designed to remind you that what you’re experiencing &lt;em&gt;is no big deal! &lt;/em&gt;But for many of us, that is far from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","type":"Keyword","title":"Women"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","type":"Keyword","title":"Sex"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/childbirth","type":"Keyword","title":"Childbirth"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/g2","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"G2"},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Comment &amp;amp; features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-production","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 production"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/may/18/the-private-pain-of-prolapse-six-things-i-wish-id-known-from-sex-to-exercise-to-mental-health","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;My own prolapse was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/feb/10/urogynecologist-childbirth-interview" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;caused by childbirth&lt;/a&gt;, but it can also be brought on by injury, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/menopause" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, age, or for simply no (as yet known by medical research) reason at all. You might have none of the symptoms and no idea you even have it; conversely, you might have all of the symptoms and yet struggle to get a diagnosis. Six years on and, while I have a general diagnosis of “pelvic organ prolapse”, I do not know &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; prolapse I have, to what degree or whether or not I have multiple prolapses. Though I’m far from content with this shocking lack of information about my condition, I – through necessity – focus on what I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know, to get through the day. Here is everything I have learned, and everything I wish I had already known about living with pelvic organ prolapse, before I had to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="penetrative-sex-will-be-different" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Penetrative sex &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t think about the effect it might have on my sex life. But, as it turns out, this is probably the area of my life that’s been most negatively affected. Yes, I have stress urinary incontinence (SUI) – but when is the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to lose control of your bladder? Yes, I have pain in my vagina – but when is the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to feel pain in your vagina? At 29, and after a couple of nightmarish attempts at intercourse, I thought I’d never be able to have penetrative sex again; the pain was more than I could bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With time, however, I realised that positioning was key. Having sex on my side so that the penis would not penetrate so deeply made a huge difference. Of course, this is no good if you get off on deeper penetration – for this, a friend advises placing a cushion under your bum, to lift your pelvis up and cause your cervix to recede. We both agree that lube is a huge help in encouraging the penis to “find the path of least resistance”. And as for the SUI? I pee beforehand, even if I don’t think I really need to. For others who may be embarrassed about losing control of their bladder, I’d recommend having sex in the bath or lubed up to the nines – both blessedly simple ways to disguise bigger or smaller leaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="-and-so-will-your-period" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;… and so will your period&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While prolapse shouldn’t affect your period, your period &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;affect your prolapse. I certainly notice an increased heaviness in my vagina and, in the days before my period arrives, I feel particularly reluctant to overexert myself physically. I now experience cramping more intensely in my vagina, perhaps due to the descent of my uterus, and I have to apply heat pads to my vulva rather than abdomen (over clothing, to prevent the risk of burns). I have found using tampons and Mooncups next to impossible; my prolapse simply squeezes them out almost as soon as I insert them. Returning to pads after a decade of not using them was disheartening for me personally, and I have yet to find a brand of period pants I can get on board with. All of this caused me to turn to the coil – which has, at least, helped to alleviate my physical symptoms. It’s not for everyone, though, and while I did not experience pain with insertion myself, I would recommend anyone concerned about this to ask their healthcare provider to use a local anaesthetic gel or spray (pain relief is not routinely offered for IUD fittings).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="your-relationship-to-exercise-will-change" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Your relationship to exercise will change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These days, it is generally only in the lead-up to my period, or after some particularly physical exertion, that my prolapse affects my mobility – but this was not the case for the first year or two. On the worst days, merely standing up felt like a monumental effort – I’d have to squeeze my pelvic floor muscles as hard as I could to combat the sense that my cervix was going to tumble out of me. Physiotherapists told me I shouldn’t pick up my baby– almost laughably impossible advice for a new parent – which left me questioning every cuddle. Friends who like to run took news of their prolapses particularly hard. One found herself unable to run 10 metres without losing full control of her bladder; incontinence pads were a gamechanger, once she was able to get past the stigma. Another option is a pessary – a small ring inserted into the vagina to help support the organs above it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-may-have-more-gynaecological-infections" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;You may have more gynaecological infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A risk that comes with pessary use, however, is the increased chance of vaginal infections. This is due to the pessary potentially introducing bacteria into the vagina, but prolapse in general is likely to increase infections. UTIs are the most common, as the descended organs can prevent the complete emptying of the bladder, or create small leaks and pooling of urine, which is a breeding ground for bacteria. After penetrative sex, residual semen can become trapped in the pockets created by the prolapse, also creating fertile ground for infection. It may seem that the answer to these problems is more rigorous hygiene standards, but introducing harsher products and rougher cleaning habits can actually have an adverse effect on the vaginal ecosystem. I have yet to come up with a better solution than regularly purchasing over-the-counter vaginal self-testing kits and requesting targeted medication from my GP, if needed. This is time consuming and expensive, and I hope that GPs will consider offering free self-testing kits for regularly occurring gynaecological infections in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-may-affect-your-future-fertility-options" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;It may affect your future fertility options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A number of healthcare professionals informed me that if I don’t want my prolapse to get any worse, I should not get pregnant again. Avoiding vaginal birth by having a caesarean section wouldn’t help, in my case, as the pressure put on my pelvic region by carrying another baby could be enough to greatly worsen my symptoms and future outlook. Surgical repair will only be offered to me once I’ve decided not to get pregnant again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to note that not all sufferers of prolapse are told that they should not become pregnant: it is judged on a case-by-case basis, and if you are prepared for your prolapse to potentially worsen then, of course, you can always go ahead with it, no matter what you are advised. But having to calculate that risk can be difficult for many. There is growing evidence to suggest that pessary use in pregnancy for those with advanced prolapse can lead to best post-birth outcomes, but more research into this and other interventions is sorely needed in order to provide as much reproductive choice as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-mental-toll-can-feel-impossible-but-it-isnt" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;The mental toll can feel impossible – but it isn’t&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t want to leave my bed. Partly, this was because every step I took felt like it was making things physically, medically, worse. But mostly, it was because of the mental toll that having a prolapse had taken on me. Doctors seemed to barely understand my condition, and shrouded it in euphemisms. I had little idea what the rest of my life was going to look like, and I suddenly – after having a baby – felt entirely alienated from my body and the child I was advised not to pick up. This is, of course, fertile grounds for postnatal depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;It is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boat&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another demographic affected by pelvic organ prolapse are those experiencing menopause – people who, like those who have just given birth, are subject to vast hormonal fluctuations and are therefore more vulnerable to poor mental health. Understanding the psychological impact that gynaecological conditions can have must begin with understanding a key element of medical misogyny: that women’s health conditions are almost universally &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/why-we-know-so-little-about-women-s-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;understudied, undertreated, and underdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;. Women find themselves experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.iasp-pain.org/advocacy/global-year/pain-in-women/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more pain, and with less likelihood of diagnosis and treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This can feel frustrating, like the system is stacked against us. But it is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boat; to campaign for better treatment options, and to work together to destigmatise conditions that are not talked about enough. Sharing my prolapse story with others, and then having so many people share their experiences with me, helped me to shed the shame I had initially felt at my body’s betrayal. Talking about how to achieve better sex, or how to manage my period, gave me a toolkit with which to move forward. We still need meaningful, institutional reform but, for now, I’m grateful not to be too ashamed to wear an incontinence pad if I need to. And nor should you be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span data-dcr-style="bullet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The Stitch-Up: How Medical Misogyny Harms Us All, by Emma Szewczak with Dr Andrzej Harris, is published by Vintage on 29 May (£22).
