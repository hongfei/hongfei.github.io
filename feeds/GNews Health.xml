&lt;p&gt;“Get the flu shot and you are 27% more likely to get the flu!” read an April 7 X post that referenced a preprint study published on April 4. “GET THE SHOT GET THE DISEASE!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, another X post trumpeted news of the study with a call for action: “All flu ‘vaccines’ must be pulled from the market pending large prospective studies of their safety and effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warnings cite a non-peer-reviewed article by Cleveland Clinic researchers titled Effectiveness of the Influenza Vaccine During the 2024-2025 Respiratory Viral Season. It was posted on April 4 on the preprint server medRxiv, which discloses in bold typeface at the top that it “reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-the-study-says-and-what-it-does-not"&gt;What the study says – and what it does not&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 53,402 Cleveland Clinic Health System employees in Ohio and found that its vaccinated participants had a higher incidence of infection in the most recent flu season. But a Cleveland Clinic spokesperson said it’s misleading to use the study to draw broader conclusions about vaccines and susceptibility to infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The data came from a relatively healthy population of about 50,000 healthcare workers and did not represent the general population,” Cleveland Clinic spokesperson Andrea Pacetti said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine helps prevent flu cases from getting more severe and requiring hospitalisation. Every year, the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee decides which viruses to use for the upcoming season’s flu vaccine. Data collected by the FDA, World Health Organization, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other partners on which flu strains are circulating around the world inform that committee’s decision. (The committee’s meeting to discuss influenza vaccine strains for the 2025-2026 influenza season was cancelled.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, during seasons when the flu vaccine strains and the circulating flu strains match, the vaccine “has been shown to reduce the risk of having to go to the doctor with flu by 40% to 60%”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert H Hopkins Jr, the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said the Cleveland Clinic study does not evaluate the primary benefit for getting vaccinated against influenza: reducing one’s risk for severe illness, hospitalisation and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People should be aware that the effectiveness of flu vaccines vary from year to year, but even when flu vaccination does not prevent infection completely, it can make the illness milder and prevent serious complications, including hospitalisation and death,” Hopkins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkins said he “completely” disagrees with the social media post calling for flu vaccines’ removal from the market. “That action would result in more &lt;a href="/news/2025/3/3/rfk-jr-noted-vaccine-sceptic-backs-measles-jab-amid-deadly-us-outbreak"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; and death from flu,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nabin Shrestha, a physician and coauthor of the study, said although the results found an increased risk of influenza among vaccinated participants, the authors understood that the increased risk “could have been from an unrecognised factor” and, therefore, did not conclude that the vaccine increases infection risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrestha also said the study did not suggest that the influenza vaccine should be pulled from the market because it makes people more likely to get the flu. “Overall, the flu vaccine is an important public health tool,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_1347470" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1347470" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1347470 size-arc-image-770" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-03-08T163551Z_1493876290_RC247M9Z76QU_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-WHITEHOUSE.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513" alt="A general view of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1347470" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia [Tami Chappell/Reuters]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who participated in the study? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland Clinic requires workers to get the annual flu vaccine or seek a medical- or religion-based exemption, so this study involved a high number of vaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the participants, 43,857 were vaccinated during the study period with 98.7 percent receiving the inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine. By the study’s end, 1,079 participants had gotten the flu – roughly 2 percent of the entire study population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacetti said it was notable that only 2 percent of the participants contracted influenza during the study period. “The population did not include children and contained very few elderly or immunocompromised individuals,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s results indicated the cumulative incidence of influenza – or the number of new cases divided by the total number of people in the study at risk (vaccinated and not vaccinated) – increased faster among the vaccinated participants than the unvaccinated ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that the influenza vaccine had a negative effectiveness, “suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza” for that season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do these findings mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccine effectiveness can vary per season and per person (factoring in characteristics such as age and health), the CDC said. Their effectiveness also depends on their similarity to the influenza viruses circulating in the community, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from the agency showed seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness – or how well the vaccine prevents severe illness and hospitalisation – changes per season with a 42 percent effectiveness rate during the 2023-2024 season. Researchers found it reduced the risk for flu-related outpatient visits and hospitalisations among children, adolescents and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkins said the study did not discuss if the workplace had masking policies or other restrictions for unvaccinated employees, which “could have an important impact on the incidence of influenza”, especially for those working in clinical settings. About 10,900 participants had a clinical nursing job, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacetti and Jeffrey Morris, biostatistics director at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, also said the vaccines primarily reduce the risk of death or severe disease, which the study does not address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article said the vaccine’s effectiveness in any given year “depends on how similar the strains contained in the vaccine are to the strains causing infection that year”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors also said because nearly all of its participants used the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, it’s possible that other influenza vaccines may have been more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 11:10:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPWXZhUzU4Yk1saUd2Z2pSY0YxX1hHcHBCcWpmd3laR21xVXBDWmlsbmNHSTgyaFVoM0UtMUMwdDJQdDI4SjZUbHItSkFhWmdXYm1fb0VoeXd2bEFJVWRZRUNUT3NVeHdTRHpkQTBVcG1lSHB3VTJVYTJobUxaU3hubGZvNW5KU0xEZUJfSFZPUHUtSU9rOWxTeVU2SGVXbUNtTFkxaU5Yb1hiZ2lLQ19HczVR0gG3AUFVX3lxTE1heFpQLTBOQk9mMlFseF9mY19OUEJvVFJXMkNmNnRTc2dhRWg3Tk8tcnhJeE11WGRRU2NBdkNtRlhfeW52RzRiV1VrZzkydnQ2ektzWW5GWWlpaDIydVdNdnZuRmpoSUk1anF1OHpqSTFBeVB2V3ZfdU1QQVVBUEJidDBYdWlMbmxtbUdqNzM0ODhTakVVOFQxUnZMVGtBRUYxcWkxcGhuME5sZlRtRl9hRlBPeWxuUQ</guid></item><item><title>“不仅仅是麻疹” ：随着疫苗接种率的下降，百日咳病例飙升- CNN | ‘Not just measles’: Whooping cough cases are soaring as vaccine rates decline - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOb3VUZGRTREN6cDdDeEtMUE5KTzM1STQ1VjZKQTBUalRKNHQ4SWVDcjNBWndtTUdRN0k5RG84djRoYWpOZjNiT05wbDNJTHFldWRUWVhyeFBGaHNzTk1lekJ1TFNqeldYalM1Wi1aWjlkZXkwRHBRQ0F1aXpJN2FDd2RtS1pVOWg5N0I1MGx3VdIBhgFBVV95cUxQZXBQSWt4VkhjeWZ3Wm1Zd0RwVkFGWUNlZnNCX1JaNGd6eXU1TzVUVHpaT2gxZGt6bDJteXJtcVJqdENTNmxRUVlTQy1KSE03aDM5MWw4bHVyLWg2V2Fab2NzUmRHUlZ4WWRXRnUybWZkRnpZX2ZMR280UUVFNEZPY0stMkVCdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            In the past six months, two babies in Louisiana have died of pertussis, the disease commonly known as whooping cough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sl000b3b6ooap27dv3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washington state recently announced its first confirmed death from pertussis in more than a decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sl000c3b6ouxv4tpwi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Idaho and South Dakota each reported a death this year, and Oregon last year reported two as well as its highest number of cases since 1950.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm9d4d6of009a3b6ot916aizn@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;

            While much of the country is focused on the spiraling measles outbreak concentrated in the small, dusty towns of West Texas, cases of pertussis have skyrocketed by more than 1,500% nationwide since hitting a recent low in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Deaths tied to the disease are also up, hitting 10 last year, compared with about two to four in previous years. Cases are on track to exceed that total this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o06s00093b6ogu8tyzg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors, researchers and public health experts warn that the measles outbreak, which has grown to more than 600 cases, may just be the beginning. They say outbreaks of preventable diseases could get much worse with falling vaccination rates and the Trump administration slashing spending on the country’s public health infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000h3b6oxzosf3n5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            National rates for four major vaccines, which had held relatively steady in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, have fallen significantly since, according to a ProPublica analysis of the most recent federal kindergarten vaccination data. Not only have vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella fallen, but federal data shows that so have those for pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000i3b6oc6jfohfr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, public health experts say that growing pockets of unvaccinated populations across the country place babies and young children in danger should there be a resurgence of these diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000l3b6o1gtzq3f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many medical authorities view measles, which is especially contagious, as the canary in the coal mine, but pertussis cases may also be a warning, albeit one that has attracted far less attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000m3b6o3qsr24nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is not just measles,” said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor in New York City and author of the book “Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children’s Health.” “It’s a bright-red warning light.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000n3b6oui3ipol7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least 36 states have witnessed a drop in rates for at least one key vaccine from the 2013-14 to the 2023-24 school years. And half of states have seen an across-the-board decline in all four vaccination rates. Wisconsin, Utah and Alaska have experienced some of the most precipitous drops during that time, with declines of more than 10 percentage points in some cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000o3b6oume8rc45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a direct correlation between vaccination rates and vaccine-preventable disease outbreak rates,” said a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Health and Human Services. “Decreases in vaccination rates will likely lead to more outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in Utah.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d412u200913b6our7c62bb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But statewide figures alone don’t provide a full picture. Tucked inside each state are counties and communities with far lower vaccination rates that drive outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003t3b6oui1qjj53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, the whooping cough vaccination rate for kindergartners in Washington state in 2023-24 was 90.2%, slightly below the U.S. rate of 92.3%, federal data shows. But the statewide rate for children 19 to 35 months last year was 65.4%, according to state data. In four counties, that rate was in the 30% range. In one county, it was below 12%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003u3b6o1b1drajs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My concern is that there is going to be a large outbreak of not just measles, but other vaccine-preventable diseases as well, that’s going to end up causing a lot of harm, and possibly deaths in children and young adults,” said Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has spent her career studying vaccines. “And it’s completely preventable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003v3b6ox7b4almd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dramatic cuts to public health funding and staffing could heighten the risk. And the elevation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, to the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, several experts said, has only compounded matters.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003w3b6ois9xqhhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Trump administration has eliminated 20,000 jobs at agencies within HHS, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation’s public health agency. And late last month, the administration also cut $11 billion from state and local public health agencies on the front lines of protecting Americans from outbreaks; the administration said the money was no longer necessary after the end of the pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003x3b6oiunra599@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Several city and county public health officials had to move quickly to lay off nurses, epidemiologists and disease inspectors. Some ceased vaccination clinics, halted wastewater surveillance programs and even terminated a contract with the courier service that transports specimens to state labs to test for infectious diseases. One Minnesota public health agency, which had provided 1,400 shots for children at clinics last year, immediately stopped those clinics when the directive arrived, court records show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003y3b6oo3lv2syh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A federal judge temporarily barred HHS from enacting the cuts, but the ruling, which came more than a week after the grants were terminated, was too late for programs that had already been canceled and employees who had already been laid off. Lawyers for HHS have asked the judge to reconsider her decision in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling that allowed the Department of Education to terminate grants for teacher training while that case is being argued in lower courts. The judge in the HHS case has not yet ruled on the motion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003z3b6o8wgdkjov@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in tiny storefronts and cozy homes, at school fairs and gas stations, many residents in West Texas, near where the measles outbreak has taken hold, appear unfazed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00403b6o28docmo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t need a vaccine,” one man sitting on his porch said recently. “I don’t get sick.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00413b6o24l8d6aa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s measles. It’s been around forever,” said a woman making her way to her car. “I don’t think it’s a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00423b6orrcgbvdj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When asked why they weren’t planning on vaccinating their baby, a husband walking alongside his wife who was 27 weeks pregnant simply said, “It’s God’s will.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d41jxi00943b6oceg4eb66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In word and deed, Kennedy has sown doubt about immunizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00443b6o2116cjsl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In response to the measles outbreak, Kennedy initially said in a column he wrote for Fox News that the decision to vaccinate is a “personal one.” HHS sent doses of vitamin A alongside vaccines to Texas, and Kennedy praised the use of cod liver oil. Only the vaccine prevents measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00453b6oikgs4ecd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About a week later, in an interview on Fox News, while Kennedy encouraged vaccines, he said he was a “freedom of choice person.” At the same time, he emphasized the risks of the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00463b6oqpsd77zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Only after the second measles death in Texas did &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy post&lt;/a&gt; on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00473b6o7k74r7mt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even that is not the unequivocal message that the head of HHS should be sending, said Ratner, the infectious diseases doctor in New York. It is, he said, a tepid recommendation at best.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00483b6orkb3o5mi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It gives the impression that these things are equivalent, that you can choose one or the other, and that is disingenuous,” he said. “We don’t have a treatment for measles. We have vitamin A, which we can give to kids with measles, that decreases but doesn’t eliminate the risk of severe outcomes. It doesn’t do anything for prevention of measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00493b6oqyol1duz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past, Kennedy has been a fierce critic of the vaccine. In a foreword to a 2021 book on measles released by the nonprofit that he founded, Kennedy wrote, “Measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear that in turn forces government officials to ‘do something.’ They then inflict unnecessary and risky vaccines on millions of children for the sole purpose of fattening industry profits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004a3b6o1qw1ipve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for HHS said, “Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency and pro-accountability.” Kennedy, the spokesperson said, responded to the measles outbreak with “clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles” and under his leadership, the CDC updated its pediatric patient management protocol for measles to include physician-administered vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004b3b6ojnblk0gx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, the spokesperson added, “is uniquely qualified to lead HHS at this pivotal moment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004c3b6ozfl95v7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Late last month, leaders at the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/measles-vaccine-rfk-cdc-report" target="_blank"&gt;ordered staff to bury a risk assessment&lt;/a&gt; that emphasized the need for vaccines in response to the measles outbreak — in spite of the fact the CDC has long &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html" target="_blank"&gt;promoted vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; as a cornerstone of public health. While a CDC spokesperson acknowledged that vaccines offer the best protection from measles, she also repeated a line Kennedy had used: “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004d3b6o5h2nf56i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the approximately 2,400 jobs eliminated at the CDC was a team in the Immunization Services Division that partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-equity/php/about/partnering-for-vaccine-equity-partners.html" target="_blank"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; to promote access to and confidence in vaccines in communities where coverage lagged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004e3b6o0s1lr9d5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The National Institutes of Health, which is also under HHS, recently ended funding for studies that examine vaccine hesitancy. In early April, researchers, the American Public Health Association and one of the largest unions in the country sued the NIH and its director, Jay Bhattacharya, along with HHS and Kennedy, alleging they terminated grants “without scientifically-valid explanation or cause.” The government hasn’t filed a response in the case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004f3b6oy2nxc4w2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The NIH cancellation notices stated that the agency’s policy was not to prioritize research that focuses on “gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004g3b6o83v3iigh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These grants are being canceled in the midst of an outbreak, a vaccine-preventable outbreak,” said Rupali Limaye, an associate professor at George Mason University who has spent the past decade studying vaccine hesitancy. “We need to better understand why people are not accepting vaccines now more than ever. This outbreak is still spreading.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004h3b6oa70j5ggw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That vaccines prevent diseases is settled science. For decades, there was a societal understanding that getting vaccinated benefited not only the person who got the shot, but also the broader community, especially babies or people with weakened immune systems, like those in chemotherapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004i3b6onzafa7c7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An investment in public health and a sustained, large-scale approach to vaccines is what helped the country declare the elimination of the measles in 2000, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004j3b6o4fsr40cl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But she has watched both deteriorate over the last few months. Nearly every morning since notices of the federal funding cuts began going out to local public health agencies, she has woken up to texts from panicked public health workers. She has led daily calls with local health departments and sat in on multiple emergency board meetings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004k3b6o7vafb83w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Freeman has compiled a list of more than 100 direct consequences of the cuts, including one rural health department in the Midwest that can no longer carry out immunization services. That’s vital because there are no hospitals in the county and all public health duties fall to the health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004l3b6o4eo1g15e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s relentless,” she said. “It feels like a barrage and assault on public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004m3b6obcf2ywx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 1,600 miles away from Washington, D.C., in Lubbock, Texas, the director of the city’s health department, Katherine Wells, sighed last week when she saw the most recent measles numbers. She would have to alert her staff to work late again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004n3b6ofamj15c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a lot of cases,” she said, “and we continue to see more and more cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004o3b6oirt2j4ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She didn’t know it at the time, but that night would mark the state’s second measles death this year. An earlier death in February was the country’s first in a decade. Both children were not vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004p3b6orw5icw9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said he traveled to Gaines County to comfort the family who lost their 8-year-old daughter and while there met with the family of the 6-year-old girl who died in February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004q3b6o7j739b4p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also visited with two local doctors he described as “extraordinary healers,” he said in his post on X. The men, he claimed, have “treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children” using aerosolized budesonide — typically used to prevent symptoms of asthma — and clarithromycin — an antibiotic. Medical experts said neither is an effective measles treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004r3b6o1unee47i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State health officials have traced about two-thirds of the measles cases in Texas to Gaines County, which sits on the western edge of the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004s3b6ooulh4kus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seminole, one of the county’s only two incorporated towns, has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak, with Tina Siemens acting as a community ambassador of sorts.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004t3b6ohfm8q2b7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Siemens, a tall woman with glasses and a short blonde bob, runs a museum that combines the area’s Native American history and Mennonite community with traditional skills like calligraphy and canning fruit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004u3b6o7r0hswui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On a recent Tuesday, atop the museum’s dark coffee table, notes scrawled onto white paper listed the latest shipments of vitamin C and Alaskan cod liver oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004v3b6ozfcf6xxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The supplies, Siemens said, were for one of the local doctors who met with Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004w3b6oz02xu2hs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As measles tears through the community, Siemens said families have to decide whether to get vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004x3b6oahxj5yfv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In America, we have a choice,” she said, echoing Kennedy’s messaging. “The cod liver oil that was flown in, the vitamin C that was flown in, was a great help.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004y3b6oitpofuug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, is working to keep the measles outbreak from reaching his community, just five hours east of Seminole. He wrote letters to the public school superintendents and leaders of private schools that had large numbers of unvaccinated or undervaccinated students offering to set up mobile vaccine clinics for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004z3b6ou38lo62l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Overall, the rates can look OK,” he said, “but when you’ve got these pockets of unvaccinated, that’s where the vulnerability lies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00503b6oyc8d96am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Huang has had to lay off 11 full-time employees, 10 temporary workers and cancel more than 50 vaccine clinics following the HHS cuts. The systemic dismantling of the CDC and other federal health agencies, he said, will have a grave and lasting impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00513b6ocn9votuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is setting us back decades,” Huang said. “Everyone should be extremely concerned about what’s going on.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00523b6owlqdlai8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across the country, pediatricians are petrified, said Dr. Susan Kressly, who serves as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the largest professional organization of pediatricians in the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00533b6oebeebuy8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many of us are losing sleep,” Kressly said. “If we lose that progress, children will pay the price.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00543b6oul37gr61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She’s carefully watching the spread of several vaccine-preventable diseases, including an increase in whooping cases that far outpace the typical peaks seen every few years. Although the whooping cough vaccine isn’t as effective as the ones for measles and protection wanes over time, the CDC says it remains the best way to prevent the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00553b6o9r9fe7ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies under the age of 1 are among the most at risk of severe complications from whooping cough, including slowed or stopped breathing and pneumonia, according to the CDC. About one-third of infants who get whooping cough end up in the hospital. Newborns are especially vulnerable because the CDC doesn’t recommend the first shot until two months. That’s why experts recommend pregnant mothers and anyone who will be around the baby to get vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00563b6o2mp9c90y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The number of whooping cough cases dropped significantly during the pandemic, but it exploded in recent years. In 2021, the CDC reported 2,116 cases; last year, there were 35,435.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00573b6or50e0g8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The numbers this year appear set to eclipse 2024. So far in 2025, 7,111 cases have been reported, which is more than double this time last year. Cases tend to spike in the summer and fall, which adds to experts’ concern about high numbers so early in the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00583b6ofndyr6ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            States on the Pacific Coast and in the Midwest have reported the most cases this year, with Washington leading the country with 742 cases so far, more than five times as many as at this time last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00593b6oc5iwtho7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Washington child who died of whooping cough had no underlying medical conditions, according to a spokesperson for the Spokane Regional Health District. The death was announced in February but occurred in November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005a3b6ofo8tbqm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Washington’s overall vaccination rate for whooping cough has remained relatively steady over the last decade at around 90%, pockets of low vaccination rates have allowed the disease to take root and put the wider community at risk, said Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, a pediatrician and chief health officer of the Washington State Department of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005b3b6op6ev6cqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is the time to strengthen the public health system, he said, to build trust in those areas and make it easier for children to get their routine vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005c3b6o2zjre9qf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But instead, we’re seeing the exact opposite happen,” he said. “We’re weakening our public health system, and that will put us on a path towards more illness and shorter lives.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005d3b6oskrkcxpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washington was one of 23 states and the District of Columbia that sued HHS and Kennedy following the $11 billion cuts, which rescinded approximately $118 million from the state. Doing so, the state said in court records, would impact 150 full-time employees and cause an immediate reduction in the agency’s ability to respond to outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005e3b6o0ike7y3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washington’s Care-A-Van, a mobile health clinic that travels across the state to provide vaccinations, conduct blood pressure screenings and distribute opioid overdose kits, was a key element in the department’s vaccination efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005f3b6osvm6zf41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that, too, has been diminished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005g3b6o2pmyq109@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An alert on the department’s website cataloged the impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005h3b6o3wjfc9d9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Attention,” it began.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005i3b6ozi0phma9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a result of the unexpected decision to terminate grant funding, “all Care-A-Van operations have been paused indefinitely, including the cancellation of more than 104 upcoming clinics across the state.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005j3b6okqdhiijr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The department had anticipated providing approximately 2,000 childhood vaccines as part of that effort.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005k3b6oi9d8g1mj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The frustration came through in Kwan-Gett’s voice. Many people think that federal cuts to public health mean shrinking the federal workforce, he said, but those clawbacks also get passed down to states and cities and counties. The less federal support that trickles down to the local level, the less protected communities will be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the mom-of-two walked into the house she was horrified to find Elynn on the floor with a 'bulging' face and 'flat' head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fearing for her daughter's life, Jordan rushed her to hospital where a CT scan confirmed she had suffered &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14334287/Father-accused-googling-make-child-disabled-bid-newborn-son-brain-damage-claim-benefits-family-court-case.html"&gt;multiple skull fractures and a brain injury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elynn was then life-flighted to a children's hospital in Milwaukee, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/wisconsin/index.html" id="mol-0aa87ee0-155a-11f0-85a1-67e81e2aff15"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, for further emergency treatment. She was put into a medically induced coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the 28-year-old mom said Vincent claimed he had accidentally dropped their daughter while trying to give her a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Jordan said Vincent was arrested and she claims she was told by Child Protective Services and a detective told that he had deliberately dropped Elynn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today Elynn is disabled and has learning difficulties, and Jordan is sharing her story to raise awareness of the permanent damage Vincent caused his daughter and the life-changing affects his actions have had on her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A little over a year later, Vincent was sentenced to 10 years in prison in April 2021 for child abuse-recklessly causing great bodily harm and neglecting a child causing great bodily harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The three-month-old had suffered multiple skull fractures and brain damage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling the chain of events, Jordan said: 'I got into the house and Elynn was on the floor playing and Carl was playing in his room and my now ex-husband was sitting on the couch waiting for me to come home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I knew something was wrong. I'm looking at my children and that's when he picks up Elynn and shows me her face. The side of her face was bulging out and the back of her head was flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She was very pale and not responsive and her eyes were ticking back to the left repeatedly, she was having seizures the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked at my ex-husband as I was really scared. Vincent told me his version of events that happened. He told me that he was holding her and said he dropped her by accident while he was making her a bottle as she was squirming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the time, I put myself in a protective mode as I needed to get my daughter out of there safely and to the hospital without him trying to stop me as my daughter was dying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the criminal complaint, Children’s Wisconsin in Wauwatosa called police on because Elynn had significant head trauma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being questioned by CPS and a detective at the hospital, Jordan was allowed to go and see her daughter and Vincent was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'They [the CPS and detective] understood immediately that I had nothing to do with it [and] the detective took me upstairs to go and see my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I got into her room and I looked at her and puked. It was the worst image I had ever seen in my life. At that moment I was scared my daughter was going to die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Elynn remained in the hospital for a month and was discharged February 7, 2020, but she has since had to undergo three major surgeries due to the extent of her injuries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jordan said: 'Elynn has beaten all the odds. Considering what she's been through, she is a very happy child'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said the doctors weren't sure Elynn was going to survive. She was experiencing frequent seizures and had to undergo a surgery to drain fluid from around her brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After having drains placed, Elynn began to open her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'When she opened her eyes, this was the first sign that I knew my daughter was going to be okay. She then continued to get stronger and stronger each day.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elynn remained in the hospital for a month and was discharged February 7, 2020, but she has since had to undergo additional major surgeries due to the extent of her injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite 'beating the odds,' Jordan says her ex-husband's actions have completely changed her daughter's life and she's glad he's now in prison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A court case report shows Vincent, who was 25 at the time, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, plus a five-year extended supervision, as well as probation of three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the court sentencing, Vincent was quoted by his defense attorney who said he claims he dropped Elynn as he believed this would 'maybe get her to stop crying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vincent (right) was sentenced to 10 years in prison in April 2021 for child abuse-recklessly causing great bodily harm and neglecting a child causing great bodily harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jordan said her daughter couldn't walk for a long time and had to undergo leg surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'I had spoken to [Vincent] three times on the phone that day and had texted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At this point [before I got home], I wasn't worried about him being at home on his own with the kids. He is their father and had never shown any physical signs to hurt anyone before.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Jordan said Vincent was 'a very angry person.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'It was almost easy for me to accept what he did because I already knew that he did it deep down on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's been my life for so many years and I have to face the consequences every day with my daughter being disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The brain injury was on the left side of her brain so this affected her entire right side of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The only thing she doesn't have issues with on her right side is her hearing. She can't see her peripheral or lower peripheral vision on her right side and we are learning what she can and can't see.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said Elynn has cerebral palsy and is behind her peers learning-wise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom also said she was getting Elynn evaluated for autism because of how her injury has affected her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan added: 'She couldn't walk for a long time and it was only in August last year that she had a second surgery on her leg to help her walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The excitement I had when she started being able to walk was one of the most emotional parts of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had been waiting years for this and I didn't think she would ever walk. She is a bit unsteady on her feet but she can finally get up and play with her brother. She has a really bad limp though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel I have got justice. I don't want him [Vincent] to ever see them [Elynn and Carl] and he won't be getting out for 20 years so I feel accomplished and like I have protected my children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Elynn has beaten all the odds. Considering what she's been through, she is a very happy child.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'I really, really regret having gotten the vaccine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelly, who recently launched a new podcast network called MK Media, said she received two &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-8b29fa80-17bc-11f0-8d9a-5714ff75a0c3"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; jabs in 2020 and then an additional booster at the recommendation of her doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lamented that she felt compelled to take the shots because it was difficult going out during the pandemic in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-8b2cb9a0-17bc-11f0-8d9a-5714ff75a0c3"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, where she lived at the time, without proof of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You could get the fake cards, but it was hard. I didn't know how to do it,' said Kelly, who was 50 when she was first immunized against COVID. 'So, I trusted my doctors and I did it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelly, who went public first announced her vaccine complications on an episode of her podcast in February, said that within months of getting the booster shot, she tested positive for an autoimmune condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her rheumatologist reportedly speculated the malady could have been a result of Kelly receiving multiple jabs and then contracting COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Podcasting queen Megyn Kelly gave the Daily Mail an exclusive update on her health, after revealing a doctor's shock diagnosis that she may be suffering from a side-effect of the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'You could get the fake cards, but it was hard. I didn't know how to do it,' said Kelly, who was 50 when she was first immunized against COVID. 'So, I trusted my doctors and I did it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I said [to the rheumatologist], could it be that I had the third shot - and then within a month of it, got the Omicron version,' Kelly recalled. 'And she said, yes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's an unfortunate thing. You can't undo the past,' Kelly said, conceding that there have been 'worse' outcomes experienced by other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But we were lied to,' she continued, criticizing the establishment for not warning the public about potential risks. 'It was not an informed assumption of the risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe side-effects attributed to the COVID vaccine have been documented, such as allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. The Centers for Disease Control has also noted other complications, such as myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, or pericarditis, inflammation of the heart lining, as well as an autoimmune disease called Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which affects the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, the COVID vaccine has also been credited with saving millions of lives globally. But there are growing, yet-unanswered questions over whether the vaccine should have been pushed so aggressively on young and healthy individuals, who were not at particular risk to adverse outcomes from the COVID virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-stage research out of Yale University also suggested a link between mRNA immunization and 'post-vaccination syndrome,' (PVS) which could cause exercise intolerance, insomnia, brain fog and dizziness. The study, published as a pre-print in February, reported that PVS could potentially contribute to autoimmunity or tissue damage – and even reawake the dormant Epstein-Barr virus in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's no question people have been hurt and even killed,' claimed Kell. 'I, for one, have learned a ton, but remain pissed off about how the whole thing was handled.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aseem Malhotra - a cardiologist, who has faced backlash for his vaccine skepticism, previously told the Daily Mail that he was diagnosed with psoriasis, speculating that it was linked to the COVID jab. He praised Kelly in February for bringing her health scare to light on her podcast – on which he also appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The fact that one of the United States' most popular public figures only just opened up about being vaccine-injured, feeling safe to discuss it with a doctor who understands the situation, suggests that many, perhaps millions of Americans are suffering in silence,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the success of 'The Megyn Kelly Podcast,' Kelly launched her latest venture last month - MK Media, a video and audio podcast network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the first three hosts to join her network is the Daily Mail's columnist Maureen Callahan, who Kelly lauded as 'clever.'

&lt;p&gt;MONTE VISTA, Colo. (KRDO) - Colorado Parks and Wildlife announces multiple raccoons have tested positive for canine distemper in recent weeks in Alamosa and Monte Vista.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A raccoon carcass from Monte Vista is the only confirmed case at this time, however, two raccoons from Alamosa show symptoms consistent with canine distemper, but official testing is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;CPW says animals with canine distemper often have difficulty moving and can act abnormally because of brain infections. Crusting around the eyes and/or nose is commonly observed, while other signs such as coughing, diarrhea, vomiting, and thickened paw pads tend to be less obvious. Sick animals usually do not survive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus is contagious and can spread to your pet at home. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CPW recommends you get your pets vaccinated and keep them away from any wild animals. In addition to raccoons, coyotes, foxes, skunks, and other carnivores can contract the virus.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had a number of reports, and one we submitted for testing did already come back positive for distemper,” said CPW District Wildlife Manager Tyler Cerny of Monte Vista. “In these cases, any other raccoon in the area exhibiting symptoms is presumed to be positive for canine distemper. We are continuing to see more cases.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;If you think your animal has canine distemper, take them to get tested for rabies. CPW says distemper cannot be distinguished from rabies without brain testing.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When a pregnant woman had her blood sampled back in 1972, doctors discovered it was mysteriously missing a surface molecule found on all other known &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/red-blood-cells-play-a-much-greater-role-in-our-immune-system-than-we-thought"&gt;red blood cells&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 50 years, this strange molecular absence finally led to researchers from the UK and Israel describing a new&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-do-we-have-blood-types"&gt; blood group system&lt;/a&gt; in humans. In 2024, the team published their paper on the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It represents a huge achievement, and the culmination of a long team effort, to finally establish this new blood group system and be able to offer the best care to rare, but important, patients," UK National Health Service hematologist Louise Tilley &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last September, after nearly 20 years of personally researching this bloody quirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're all more familiar with the ABO blood group system and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_factor_testing"&gt;Rh factor&lt;/a&gt; (that's the plus or minus part), humans actually have &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_blood_group_systems"&gt;many different blood group systems&lt;/a&gt; based on the wide variety of cell-surface proteins and sugars that coat our blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies use these antigen molecules, amongst their other purposes, as identification markers to separate 'self' from potentially harmful not-selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_140271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg" alt="Diagram of ABO blood groups and the IgM antibodies present in each." class="size-full wp-image-140271" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood type (or blood group) is determined, in part, by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="158063" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Antibodies&lt;/a&gt; in our blood plasma detect when a foreign antigen marker is present.&lt;span&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/ABO_blood_type.svg"&gt;InvictaHOG/Public Domain/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these markers do not match up when receiving a blood transfusion, this life-saving tactic can &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482202/"&gt;cause reactions or even end up being fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most major blood groups were identified early in the 20th century. Many discovered since, like the Er blood system &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/discovery-of-a-new-rare-blood-type-could-save-the-lives-of-future-newborns"&gt;first described by researchers in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, only impact a small number of people. This is also the case for the new blood group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The work was difficult because the genetic cases are very rare," &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Tilley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148174" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642.jpg" alt="A person's arm with a cannula, receiving a blood transfusion" class="size-full wp-image-148174" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148174" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Transfusion reactions can be severe. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFagVIxPSo/"&gt;Africa images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research found more than 99.9 percent of people have the AnWj antigen that was missing from the 1972 patient's blood. This antigen lives on a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAL_(gene)"&gt;myelin and lymphocyte protein&lt;/a&gt;, leading the researchers to call the newly described system the MAL blood group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone has a mutated version of both copies of their &lt;em&gt;MAL&lt;/em&gt; genes, they end up with an AnWj-negative blood type, like the pregnant patient. Tilley and team identified three patients with the rare blood type that didn't have this mutation, suggesting that sometimes blood disorders can also cause the antigen to be suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MAL is a very small protein with some interesting properties which made it difficult to identify and meant we needed to pursue multiple lines of investigation to accumulate the proof we needed to establish this blood group system," &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; University of the West of England cell biologist Tim Satchwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine they had the correct gene, after decades of research, the team inserted the normal &lt;em&gt;MAL&lt;/em&gt; gene into blood cells that were AnWj-negative. This effectively delivered the AnWj antigen to those cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MAL protein is known to play a vital role in keeping cell membranes stable and aiding in cell transport. What's more, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1537-2995.1988.28388219164.x"&gt;previous research found&lt;/a&gt; that the AnWj isn't actually present in newborn babies but appears soon after birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, all the AnWj-negative patients included in the study shared the same mutation. However, no other cell abnormalities or diseases were found to be associated with this mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the researchers have identified the genetic markers behind the &lt;em&gt;MAL&lt;/em&gt; mutation, patients can be tested to see if their negative MAL blood type is inherited or due to suppression, which could be a sign of another underlying medical problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rare blood quirks can have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/discovery-of-a-new-rare-blood-type-could-save-the-lives-of-future-newborns"&gt;devastating impacts on patients&lt;/a&gt;, so the more of them we can understand, the more lives can be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2024025099"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even better: you don’t even have to clock 10,000 steps a day or be a fast walker to see a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity seems to be the ultimate multitasking move for improved health. It’s already been linked to a wide variety of benefits, from a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6557987/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthier heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthier heart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10503965/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:higher-quality sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;higher-quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1136900/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;less anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a63655358/walk-to-live-longer-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:longer life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;longer life&lt;/a&gt;. This new study signals that cancer prevention might deserve a spot on the list of exercise perks as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how much do you really need to walk to lower your risk of cancer? And how fast do your feet need to move? To find out exactly what this new research says about the link between exercise and cancer risk, we reached out to the lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the researchers did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, scientists took data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UK Biobank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; study in which more than 85,000 adults wore devices that tracked their total daily activity, activity intensity and daily step count for a week. After an average of 5.8 years passed, 2,633 of the participants had been diagnosed with one of 13 types of cancer. The researchers then crunched all the numbers and adjusted for at least nine major cancer risk factors (such as smoking, drinking alcohol and eating red meat) to figure out how a person’s physical activity might lower their risk of developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the study found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who walked an average of 7,000 steps per day had a 11% lower risk of cancer than those who only took 5,000 daily steps. Those with a daily step count of 9,000 had a 16% lower risk.&lt;/strong&gt; Surprisingly, it doesn’t seem like walking more than 9,000 steps will amplify the cancer-prevention benefits much. “Above this level, it was not clear if the risk reductions linked to higher step counts were statistically different,” says &lt;a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/fellowship-experience/meet-fellows/meb/shreves-alaina" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alaina Shreves, M.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alaina Shreves, M.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a predoctoral fellow in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health and the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow walkers, rejoice! One of the most interesting (and exciting!) findings to come out of this research is that &lt;strong&gt;you don’t have to be a power walker to lower your risk of cancer. “The pace of the steps — step intensity — seemed to be less important,” says Shreves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does exercise help lower your risk of cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers aren’t exactly sure why physical activity seems to have a protective effect against cancer, but there are some theories. “For example, exercise can bring about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11591795/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:beneficial changes in hormones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;beneficial changes in hormones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-025-86306-2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fa64433049%2Fstudy-walking-lower-cancer-risk%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve insulin sensitivity;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6962351/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and may &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007165.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve immune function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve immune function&lt;/a&gt;,” says Shreves.

Essentially, exercise is good for so many parts of your body that it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cancer-protecting mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for future research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get an even better idea of how exercise may help prevent cancer, “future studies should explore how physical activity affects the risk of specific types of cancer,” Shreves says. For instance, maybe it has a bigger impact on a person’s risk of say, prostate cancer than lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most studies, more research is needed to confirm the results, but these results are promising. &lt;strong&gt;“Increasing your daily physical activity may help reduce the risk of certain cancers, regardless of the intensity of the activity,” says Shreves. “Find activities you enjoy, like walking your dog or taking a stroll, and stay active!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:20:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1xRDJYU19adjZSVDdJUnBKM0pHTHFkQTM1d0Y1ajZ3eEJNRDF0Z0VRRDlpTkJNUHBPUW5lLTltdGNBNDhRRUE4VXNfcS1KdmNNd05OaVUyUWgwTXpCSHpxUEhYeEVjTUZGMExqOHgyQ0lSQWJoNVE</guid></item><item><title>医生说他们找到了一种方法来清除体内的微塑料-未来主义 | Doctors Say They’ve Found a Way to Clean the Microplastics Out of Your Body - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE1ZNUd5Vzh4MXhnWnYxdl9SRlNQdGQyak0yem5tTXJEVGxDWUczOGRpamRWaWNmanE3YXVWajJwWTR1RkJ2cVpkaUFZYjZrRkxoX3hCZ2hxM0VwQ2Zia1VhMTE2bGFDcHU4a3BETlc0NUN4aFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Peter Dazeley via Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-end medical practice is offering clients the purported service of scrubbing their blood of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-startup-promises-to-clean-your-blood-of-microplastics-clarify-clinics/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Clarify Clinics CEO Yael Cohen said that her London facility's &lt;a href="https://clarifyclinics.com/what-we-do/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;bespoke blood-filtering service&lt;/a&gt; — which is otherwise known as apheresis and generally &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/apheresis" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;used for plasma donation&lt;/a&gt; or other so-called &lt;a href="https://www.saintlukeskc.org/health-library/understanding-therapeutic-plasma-exchange-tpe" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;therapeutic plasma exchange&lt;/a&gt; procedures — is so comfortable that some patients doze off during it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once it’s running, you feel nothing. It’s very comfortable," Cohen told the magazine of its Clari procedure, which costs more than $12,000 &lt;a href="https://clarifyclinics.com/book/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;per session&lt;/a&gt;. "Patients take calls, do Zooms, watch movies, sleep.

While studies in recent years have established links between microplastics and &lt;a href="https://hull-repository.worktribe.com/output/3883618/a-rapid-review-and-meta-regression-analyses-of-the-toxicological-impacts-of-microplastic-exposure-in-human-cells" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;damage to human cells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;hearts&lt;/a&gt;, that research was all, as &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; notes, observational. Thus far, the only thing we know definitively is that these mysterious particles have been found &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;nearly everywhere researchers have looked&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;our blood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/microplastics-in-organs" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;guts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/brains-microplastics-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;brains&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/25/uk/microplastics-archeological-remains-study-scli-intl-scn-gbr/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;archaeological digs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/microplastics-found-near-everests-peak-highest-ever-detected-world-perpetual-planet" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there don't appear to be any studies about the &lt;a href="https://clarifyclinics.com/science/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;effectiveness of the Clari procedure&lt;/a&gt;, there's a pretty strong body of evidence suggesting that therapeutic plasma exchange in general is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5620780/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;safe and effective treatment&lt;/a&gt; for some &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24197-plasmapheresis-plasma-exchange" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;autoimmune and neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the desire to get those foreign and synthetic particulates out of one's blood, and to clean one's blood in general, makes some degree of sense. According to Cohen, longevity influencer Bryan Johnson's interest in so-called "&lt;a href="https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1845950287032492378?lang=en" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;total plasma exchange&lt;/a&gt;" — a more extreme apheresis procedure he used to &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/bryan-johnson-young-blood-son" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;get his son's blood filtered into his own&lt;/a&gt; — where all of the body's plasma is removed and replaced with proteins and antibodies, has been a big boon for her business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He’s a big platform, and he is spending a lot of time and energy finding the things that move the needle the most," the CEO said of Johnson, a former &lt;em&gt;Futurism &lt;/em&gt;investor who's no longer involved with the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it doesn't appear that &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; shelled out for its reporter, Matt Reynolds, to get his blood scrubbed, the journalist did get his microplastics levels tested to see what the fuss was about. In a fingerprick &lt;span&gt;sample of&lt;/span&gt; blood, Reynolds had about 190 microplastic particles per millimeter, which is apparently on the lower end of the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleased with the results, the reporter emailed Cohen. In response, she pointed out the stark truth: that he still has "around a million particles in [his] circulatory system!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on microplastics:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/chewing-gum-microplastics" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chewing Gum Is Flooding Your Mouth With Microplastics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:15:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1ZNUd5Vzh4MXhnWnYxdl9SRlNQdGQyak0yem5tTXJEVGxDWUczOGRpamRWaWNmanE3YXVWajJwWTR1RkJ2cVpkaUFZYjZrRkxoX3hCZ2hxM0VwQ2Zia1VhMTE2bGFDcHU4a3BETlc0NUN4aFk</guid></item><item><title>末日滚动背后的科学--以及如何阻止它--《泰晤士报》 | The science behind doomscrolling — and how to stop it - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQM0s4cW9lMUdHRFY4dDRSRHNkb0N0TjlOZi1fa041VjlYLVowUmczZnlFMzJucjBVX1VZbEt3QWlhRnkxQVdwTm8yNWt2ZlhKQWZocUhPSVJXV25hblJCZlo1SnFTcnh0TGVJVlVYTktraU5obzFHLUx4VWRKVHVnZXpDSnVBY1Y2SEc5NzBNdXI0OXhGM3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;span class="responsive__DropCap-sc-1pktst5-1 enuiNL"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;here has been, you may have noticed, no shortage of bad news lately. Wars rumble on, markets teeter, ice caps retreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some of us respond in a way that feels almost instinctive — we reach for our phones, we refresh late into the night, we obsessively absorb new details. The habit has acquired a name: doomscrolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Coined during the pandemic, when new crises seemed to unfold by the hour, the term describes the compulsion to trawl through endless bleak headlines on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So why does bad news have such a grip on us? And how can we loosen it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A quirk of evolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;At its core, doomscrolling appears to exploit a quirk of human psychology — our built-in bias for negativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Evolutionarily, being alive&lt;span&gt; to danger helped our ancestors survive. When early humans roamed the African savannah, those attuned to potential threats — say, the rustle of a predator in the undergrowth — stood a better chance of survival. A false positive (panicking at the wind) was preferable to a false negative (ignoring a lion).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Journalists have long understood this tendency. “If it bleeds, it leads,” runs the old newsroom adage, born of the intuition that tales of bloodshed and calamity shift more papers than good news ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In the digital age, the “lion in the grass” that hijacks our attention might be a lurid post about war, recession or ecological collapse. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism — an inheritable personality trait — appear particularly vulnerable, says Professor Christopher Ferguson of Stetson University. So too do those with low tolerance for uncertainty, who seek definitive answers in a chaotic world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Could bad news fuel bad health?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="8.3"&gt;&lt;div id="ac728863-6345-4402-b877-9b344a3cf476"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__FullWidthImg-sc-4v1r4q-4 jGJovF"&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__FullWidthCaptionContainer-sc-1io40fc-3 hADFiz"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Scientists are investigating whether doomscrolling causes chronic, low-grade inflammation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Doomscrolling resembles rumination — the repetitive, unproductive dwelling on dark thoughts. The science is still emerging, but some studies suggest a link between &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/doom-scrolling-really-does-make-you-more-depressed-study-finds-2gnxvm99d" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;heavy social media use and depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety and lower life satisfaction. Whether it is the scrolling that stokes low moods or that people who already feel unhappy tend to spend more time online is not clear. Many researchers suspect it is a bit of both, but if doomscrolling robs you of sleep, it is unlikely to improve your frame of mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The effects may also be physical. Dr Dan Nicolau of King’s College London, is investigating whether the compulsive consumption of bad news primes the body’s immune system for a battle that never comes. Early results suggest links between heavy social media use and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation found in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Inflammation, in small doses, can be a good thing. It helps fight infection and repair injury. If you are about to square off with a big cat, it makes sense for your body to be prepared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, in the modern world — sitting on a sofa, doomscrolling through disasters — this ancient defence mechanism may be misfiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Nicolau suspects that doomscrolling can lead the body to brace for physical trauma that never arrives, resulting in chronic, low-grade inflammation — the physiological equivalent of sleeping in your boots for a war that’s forever just over the horizon. This kind of smouldering, low-grade inflammation has been linked to a host of diseases, from &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/map-brain-watershed-neuroscience-mice-787r0nbpl" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; to arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Meanwhile, conditions such as depression and schizophrenia, long assumed to be purely neurological, are now thought to have inflammatory components. Whether inflammation helps cause these illnesses or merely accompanies them is unclear, but the two are increasingly hard to separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to stop scrolling?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Addiction, says Nicolau, is often as much about anticipation as it is about consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For an alcoholic, mood-boosting hormones will surge before the first sip, he explained. Simply being exposed to certain environmental cues — say, the clink of glasses — can drive these pleasure responses close to their peak levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“In effect, addicts get much of the biochemical high without the substance,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/midlife-social-media-addict-advice-stop-vk8x79tgw" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Midlife social media addict? Here’s what to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If similar mechanisms underlie compulsive digital behaviours, putting distance between yourself and your phone is the obvious first step. That might mean charging it in another room or turning it off overnight. Removing shortcuts to certain apps from your home screen might help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Other options include apps that promise to make it harder for you to waste time on other apps. There are digital tools that require users to solve a maths puzzle before launching a compulsive platform like TikTok. The aim is to buy a moment of clarity — to realise: “Actually, I’d rather be doing something else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Ferguson said: “Social media use and smartphone use should be fun for the most part.

Some studies suggested it was beneficial for fighting the disease, while others said it could cause more problems than it solves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study didn't find glaring evidence that using aspirin makes you cancer-proof, it certainly suggests that those who live unhealthy lifestyles that put them at higher risk of developing cancer could greatly benefit from regularly taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, for those who already had colorectal cancer, taking aspirin regularly greatly decreased the likelihood of the cancer returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developments are exciting, but aspirin is still a medicine and should be treated as such. The drug is known to have side effects like stomach bleeding, particularly in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that aspirin might not be the best choice for everyone, but that it certainly could be part of anyone's cancer-fighting toolkit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 18:11:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1gJBVV95cUxQOXVCS3NRTTVvUmx5dXlaVDVvVnVFRlFFWGluYVJGQWQwTE55a2JhYXNJUjRxRUVmdkI1SHBfUTJVelU0azdGeF8yc2psbGpoZnlJQnkxNGhlWVZwVFdwY3JJSVNSRmZFeEdYWW50bDdyNHBiVjRhN3FicHhQUFE2MV9fZS1fQU9zRXJHdGE2MlF0dVVhdTZTN3hSU1JCRWdkdEdLeFMwN1ZMYk5EV0lmeG1ud1hNUnlvTktkVVFTejR1cmhJY3JfZkk3TzdvR01FSjUwQkZ4LVh1bjhrTjZJbEZQU0ZacGNXM212eUtORUhGRnRXWXNOeHRxNVp4NTJMbkRGa3o2cFRpSDY4S0pqNlNZd0xhN3lMLTRrUWVncXhsRkNabGlFVmNlRW1nUDR5ZTZqVy13WDZGQTJRaDlUNXduYU5aaWFuenZKdFNyODNlV1JnZkE</guid></item><item><title>敲指技巧可以在背景噪音下提高听力-新闻的光明面 | Finger-tapping trick can sharpen your hearing against background noise - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQUWQxOTFJZFJjd0ZaMGxjS0FkejVubzlPMW1jY1hQazZJZDRoZDBxbExBal9tenJlRVRDRTBtR3F0M2RuQjlINW5DVzB3UlNkVVgyb2FKX21WbTRjNi1JS2hveE5vSVdYWWNFQW1CWm9DeEtKeVFuZlc0V0d1b216cTJqb3ltaE1rbS1qajhCMlFHdk9NY3VRUlVHZ3RUSHhPRGhtRGRVcnF5TlhEZVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapping your fingers to a rhythm before you enter a noisy room might seem like a strange ritual. But recent research reveals this simple act can significantly improve your ability to understand speech amidst distracting background noise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="rhythmic_tapping_and_your_brain_s_ability_to_hear"&gt;Rhythmic Tapping and Your Brain's Ability to Hear&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever struggled to follow a conversation at a crowded cafe or busy social event? French researchers discovered a practical trick: tapping your fingers rhythmically before entering these noisy settings enhances your speech comprehension. This finding builds on the idea that your &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/scientists-discover-brain-protein-that-can-slow-down-aging/"&gt;brain’s motor system&lt;/a&gt;—the part controlling physical movements—plays a crucial role in understanding spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Schematic of an experimental trial for (A) experiment 1, (B) experiment 2 and (C) experiment 3. Each trial started with a prime after which participants heard a spoken sentence presented in noise. (CREDIT: Proceedings of the Royal Society B) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this concept, researchers conducted three experiments involving young adults. Each participant listened to sentences mixed with loud &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-mobile-app-clinically-proven-to-treat-tinnitus/"&gt;background noise&lt;/a&gt;. Their task was simple: write down the words they heard. Before hearing these sentences, participants engaged in rhythmic activities, including tapping fingers at different speeds or saying words aloud. Each experiment tested a unique aspect of how rhythmic movement affects speech understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="finding_the_ideal_rhythm_for_listening"&gt;Finding the Ideal Rhythm for Listening&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, 35 participants tapped their fingers to three different speeds—slow, medium, and fast—before listening to noisy sentences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that tapping at a medium pace—about two taps per second—led to clearer understanding of the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/21-language-neural-text-to-speech-technology-now-works-on-smartphones/"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; afterward. This rate, known scientifically as the "lexical rate," aligns closely with the rhythm naturally found in human speech, approximately 1.8 beats per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen? According to the scientists, rhythmic finger-tapping helps your brain synchronize with the timing of speech patterns. This synchronization allows your brain to predict speech timing, improving its ability to filter out noise and focus on words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="physical_movement_enhances_auditory_processing"&gt;Physical Movement Enhances Auditory Processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second experiment asked whether tapping itself mattered, or if simply listening to a rhythmic beat would have the same effect. Surprisingly, researchers found that participants who actively tapped along—whether or not they heard an external beat—had significantly better &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-natural-repair-process-that-fixes-damaged-hearing/"&gt;speech comprehension&lt;/a&gt;. Merely listening passively did not provide the same benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The motor system is known to process temporal information," the researchers explained, "and moving rhythmically while listening to a melody can improve auditory processing." Their results indicate that the physical act of moving your body is crucial, rather than just hearing a rhythm. Active engagement appears to "prime" your auditory processing centers effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Experiment 1. (A) Inverse efficiency scores (IES), (B) proportion correct, and (C) correct reaction times (RT) for the no tapping (control, in beige), tapping at ~1.1 Hz (phrasal rate, in red), tapping at ~1.8 Hz (lexical rate, in blue), and tapping at ~5 Hz (syllabic rate, in brown) conditions. (CREDIT: Proceedings of the Royal Society B) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="speaking_aloud_also_boosts_your_listening_skills"&gt;Speaking Aloud Also Boosts Your Listening Skills&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final experiment, the researchers explored if speaking aloud before listening to noisy sentences would help comprehension. Participants said a random word aloud before hearing sentences masked by background noise. Interestingly, the spoken word did not need to relate to the sentence at all. Merely producing vocal sound beforehand enhanced the listener’s ability to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ai-powered-noise-canceling-headphone-lets-wearers-handpick-the-sounds-they-want-to-hear/"&gt;understand subsequent speech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding emphasizes the role of active motor behavior—specifically speech production—in boosting auditory processing. Vocalizing primes the brain similarly to tapping, confirming the connection between speech production and comprehension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suggest this happens because speaking involves brain areas closely linked to those used for listening, creating a shared pathway for improved speech perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="why_rhythmic_priming_works_in_your_brain"&gt;Why Rhythmic Priming Works in Your Brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your brain continually tracks timing patterns in speech. When you tap your fingers rhythmically or vocalize words, you activate motor areas that are essential for processing temporal (time-based) information. These motor areas form part of an internal "clock" in your brain, enabling you to predict when sounds like syllables or words will occur. This rhythmic preparation enhances your brain's readiness to interpret incoming speech signals accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies showed that rhythmically structured speech benefits greatly from rhythmic priming. However, speech in everyday &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/are-ai-doctors-good-at-holding-medical-conversations-with-patients/"&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; doesn't follow strict timing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers wanted to test if rhythmic priming helps with natural, non-rhythmic speech. The positive results of their experiments strongly suggest it does, expanding potential uses for rhythmic priming beyond controlled clinical environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Experiment 2.

These findings could lead to new techniques in language education and speech therapy. For example, teachers and therapists might incorporate rhythmic tapping into exercises to aid students or patients struggling with language processing. This approach could be especially helpful for individuals with conditions that affect auditory focus, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, scientists emphasize the need for further research before applying this method widely. Participants in these initial studies were young, healthy, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-robotic-therapy-could-revolutionize-schizophrenia-treatment/"&gt;French-speaking&lt;/a&gt; adults without neurological conditions. Additional research is needed to determine if rhythmic priming effects vary with age, language background, or neurological differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the exact brain mechanisms remain theoretical. Although researchers believe motor areas connect directly with auditory pathways to create improved speech processing, this hypothesis requires confirmation through brain imaging studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Experiment 3. (A) Inverse efficiency scores (IES), (B) proportion correct, and (C) correct reaction times (RT) for the articulation of a semantically congruent verb (S+A+, in dark orange), the covert reading of a semantically congruent verb (S+A−, in light orange), the articulation of a semantically incongruent verb (S−A+, in dark green), and the covert reading of a semantically incongruent verb (S−A−, in light green) conditions.

If you often find yourself overwhelmed by background noise, tapping your fingers or briefly vocalizing beforehand might significantly improve your listening experience. Such simple preparation can make social interactions less stressful, especially in noisy places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the study's authors remarked, "These findings provide evidence for the functional role of the motor system in processing the temporal dynamics of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-discover-how-space-and-time-interact-in-the-brain/"&gt;naturalistic speech&lt;/a&gt;." This means your body movements can directly impact how well you hear and comprehend others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, rhythmic priming could be a practical, low-cost solution to enhance communication, particularly for those who struggle in noisy environments. While further studies will expand our understanding, this research provides a compelling reason to keep your fingers tapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 18:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQUWQxOTFJZFJjd0ZaMGxjS0FkejVubzlPMW1jY1hQazZJZDRoZDBxbExBal9tenJlRVRDRTBtR3F0M2RuQjlINW5DVzB3UlNkVVgyb2FKX21WbTRjNi1JS2hveE5vSVdYWWNFQW1CWm9DeEtKeVFuZlc0V0d1b216cTJqb3ltaE1rbS1qajhCMlFHdk9NY3VRUlVHZ3RUSHhPRGhtRGRVcnF5TlhEZVE</guid></item><item><title>科学家第一次在实验室中生长的人牙 - 独立 | Human teeth grown in a lab for first time by scientists - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQNDVEMEZURVh1cXhQRVlpLTdLc090Ty1OZzdvR19GU0tIZUF4VHNIWDJYUGRUeEs0MF9kWl90aW5BYWRIWURDT1ZqTUFVRi1ncVNjUndab2std3ZBVVpvRVJsdjRib3VVVDgtN0xOcEpQZE5uWGM0NVpueUluckNUdGsxSzFKUXVuWmFiREtVY0lhM0R0a3FQX21IcUxpZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 caTeJB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 blUixN"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cfrdoh"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Over time, they will weaken tooth structure, have a limited lifespan, and can lead to further decay or sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Implants require invasive surgery and a good combination of implants and alveolar bone. Both solutions are artificial and don’t fully restore natural tooth function, potentially leading to long-term complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lab-grown teeth would naturally regenerate, integrating into the jaw as real teeth. They would be stronger, longer lasting, and free from rejection risks, offering a more durable and biologically compatible solution than fillings or implants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous efforts to recreate this process in the lab had failed, as the cells were unable to communicate effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now exploring two possible approaches: growing a whole tooth in the lab before implanting it or placing early-stage tooth cells directly into the patient’s jaw where they could continue developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Zhang added: “We have different ideas to put the teeth inside the mouth. We could transplant the young tooth cells at the location of the missing tooth and let them grow inside the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alternatively, we could create the whole tooth in the lab before placing it in the patient’s mouth. For both options, we need to start the very early tooth development process in the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Angelova Volponi added: “As the field progresses, the integration of such innovative techniques holds the potential to revolutionise dental care, offering sustainable and effective solutions for tooth repair and regeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 18:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQNDVEMEZURVh1cXhQRVlpLTdLc090Ty1OZzdvR19GU0tIZUF4VHNIWDJYUGRUeEs0MF9kWl90aW5BYWRIWURDT1ZqTUFVRi1ncVNjUndab2std3ZBVVpvRVJsdjRib3VVVDgtN0xOcEpQZE5uWGM0NVpueUluckNUdGsxSzFKUXVuWmFiREtVY0lhM0R0a3FQX21IcUxpZw</guid></item><item><title>侵袭性脑肿瘤使温莎青少年无法行走或阅读- BBC | Aggressive brain tumour left Windsor teen unable to walk or read - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9BN3ViNlV1RjdBdU5pZkNwaVFIaXVfaDZSUnF6cFdEUmJOOUhHTDZXQlc4bkxZM1Y1LUtOc1lKQjI0RWRsT2lFbFI1N19pOGlvdWxVVGlqUnZ4d9IBX0FVX3lxTE5xUlFTYkd5MGZqcGxzOFdNZHZXUjBnaDVsd1FIV3ZNU3QxdHRURXUybjhzdE9ZN3MwTnVHSnpnVXlnSXZVcXBUMFV3YlZyU1Z2Um8yeW9mX3BUcWgtSDFj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;'I'm living proof brain tumour research saves lives'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Brain Tumour Research Indi following the surgery.

Studies show that eating fiber nourishes your &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/20/gut-health-microbiome-best-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3399949/#:~:text=Dietary%20fiber%20(DF)%20decreases%20the,2%2C%205%2C%206)."&gt;lowers your risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Health authorities &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/how-understand-and-use-nutrition-facts-label"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that adults eat at least 28 grams of fiber a day. Yet the average person&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the United States&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/Pdf/0910/Table_1_Nin_Gen_09.Pdf"&gt;eats far less&lt;/a&gt; than that — just 16 grams of fiber daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="32MW7T7KNRCQPBG45MNE5XUJAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Edamame pasta is also high in protein: A serving of edamame spaghetti has about 24 grams of protein — equivalent to the amount of protein in four eggs. Edamame spaghetti is gluten-free and rich in iron, potassium and calcium, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="1X6Q6CWV2D3AZAYKRPTZVAZFB0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Danielle Belardo, a preventive cardiologist and nutrition expert in Los Angeles, said she eats edamame spaghetti and other legume-based pastas three to four times a week. Belardo, a vegan, said legume pastas provide “an excellent combination of high fiber and high protein in one convenient, whole-food package.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="9262T0CGVT2TH0M5CBQQ7ZVVG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Belardo said she recommends legume pastas to her patients because the pastas are convenient, filling, and can improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IX3ZS75VLBAQXLUKCQVHOQ4AYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But cooking with legume pastas — and making them taste good — isn’t the same as cooking with traditional varieties. To help you make the most out of legume pastas, we analyzed their nutritional benefits and experimented with several recipes for edamame pasta in the kitchen. Here’s what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="KB6E56P55VD3JLOOB5W5NC22OE" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="KB6E56P55VD3JLOOB5W5NC22OE"&gt;Legume pastas vs. traditional pastas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D7EDVNMGABGKLHBW54X2GCH2MQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many legume pastas contain just one ingredient: dried beans or lentils that are ground into flour and combined with water to make dough, which is then shaped into spaghetti, penne, rotini and other types of pasta. Because legumes are high in protein and fiber, so too is legume pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWXQSQZ7XNCCDEYYMIY6BLQUWY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Traditional dried pasta is made from wheat kernels that have had their outer layers removed, a process called refining. That’s important because these parts of the wheat contain most of its fiber and vitamins. The part that’s left behind and used to make the pasta is the starchy endosperm, which is why traditional pasta is low in fiber and full of fast-digesting carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4FFX6TGQ5D0C996NB8Q85WWEZW" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some pastas are made from whole wheat, meaning they’re made from the whole grain. Whole wheat pasta contains more fiber and other nutrients than traditional white pasta. But legume pastas typically contain more protein and fiber than whole wheat pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ORAQ2ZFRYRHWJEFG3FTO6HKFL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In terms of flavor, legume pastas taste earthier and nuttier than conventional pasta, making them reminiscent of whole wheat noodles. Texture-wise, they’re bouncier and seem akin to soba noodles, making them particularly well-suited to Asian flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="44GK72A92T313E87UX3BAEDRKG" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="44GK72A92T313E87UX3BAEDRKG"&gt;The health benefits of legume pastas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="JDIP5AGAFZAYRMY42O7RGHU2OI" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fiber&lt;/b&gt;: Legume pastas made from edamame, black beans, lupine beans and red lentils are especially high in fiber. Scientists think there are a number of reasons fiber has been linked to &lt;a href="http://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2818%2931809-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;better health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/20/gut-health-microbiome-best-foods/"&gt;promotes the growth&lt;/a&gt; of healthy microbes in your gut and prompts them to produce compounds like short chain fatty acids, which lower inflammation. These microbes also stimulate the release of GLP-1, a hormone that promotes satiety and helps to lower blood sugar levels. This is the same hormone that drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are designed to mimic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low glycemic&lt;/b&gt;: Because legume pastas are high in fiber and relatively low in carbs, they have a lower glycemic impact than regular pasta. That means they’re digested more slowly and are less likely to spike your blood sugar levels. That can translate to metabolic health benefits. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10746079/"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that eating low-glycemic foods can improve blood sugar control and help people lose weight and body fat. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10746079/"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that it can also reduce blood pressure and inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plant protein&lt;/b&gt;: Belardo especially likes that legume pastas are rich in plant protein. In one study published in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32699048/" target="_blank"&gt;journal BMJ&lt;/a&gt;, scientists analyzed data on over 715,000 people who were followed for up to 32 years. They found that people who consumed a lot of plant protein were 8 percent less likely to die during the study period compared with people who ate very little plant protein. They also had a 12 percent lower risk of dying of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="2XZPG9KETX1HF1C0YACZTP8JYC" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="2XZPG9KETX1HF1C0YACZTP8JYC"&gt;How to cook edamame pasta&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6GL64DQRPFDKPJQT7TV5LO34GQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So how can you make a delicious edamame pasta dish? To find out, we experimented with several approaches to the sauce, with the goal of finding something punchy enough to stand up to the spaghetti — or perhaps even overpower it to satisfy anyone who might find the pasta to be an acquired taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X634ZJGPHFENVNKDJDR5DHJQU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ultimately, we found a winner in a vibrant sauce made with whole peas, feta and pistachios. The dish clocks in at 22 grams of fiber (more than three-quarters of a day’s worth) and 39 grams of protein — and goes down easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AXPDDFUPUBBWNFLJ6FNTWNYQZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here are tips for cooking with edamame and other legume pastas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ol class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="2HFTMV2KORBADFQXIAYVHKKDZY" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you’re new to legume pastas, then start off slow.&lt;/b&gt; Start with a 2-ounce serving of legume pasta once a week. If you want to eat it more often, then gradually increase the amount to two or more servings per week over the ensuing weeks. Experts say that for some people, suddenly increasing the amount of fiber in your diet — from legume pastas or any other fiber-rich foods — could lead to some initial gastrointestinal discomfort. But over time that should go away as your body adjusts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be sure to follow the package instructions for cooking. &lt;/b&gt;One brand of edamame spaghetti, for instance, calls for you to boil it for just 5 or 6 minutes, while another suggests adding it to boiling water, turning off the heat and letting the pasta gently soak until tender.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember the sauce adds fiber, too. &lt;/b&gt;In our experiments in the kitchen, adding ingredients such as artichoke hearts, navy beans and mustard greens tasted good. But the fiber overload was simply too much and felt heavy going down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pick the legume pasta that tastes best to you. &lt;/b&gt;Some have different flavors and textures than others, so you should try a few and see which ones you like. A good starting point for most people is chickpea or lentil pasta, since their textures tend to be the most similar to traditional wheat pasta, Belardo said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pair the pasta with punchy flavors. &lt;/b&gt;Garlicky, lemony and maybe spicy flavors can stand up to the pasta’s earthy taste. Belardo said she likes eating red lentil pasta with arugula pesto, walnuts and chia seeds. She also likes edamame spaghetti tossed with lemon tahini sauce and roasted vegetables, and black bean spaghetti with sautéed mushrooms and tomato sauce. Another smart option would be to employ a spicy peanut sauce with the edamame spaghetti, perhaps using it instead of the soba noodles in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/spicy-peanut-soba-noodles-green-beans/" target="_blank"&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt; from The Post’s Dinner in Minutes columnist, Aaron Hutcherson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HGTIXJI4XFFF3IDH6X7B6VHUW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a question about healthy eating?

Moreover, while women are as likely to have a heart attack as men, they are more likely to die from one. And this is often attributed to delayed diagnosis and undertreatment of CVD in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The age factor:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While heart attacks are more common in older adults, there's a growing concern about their incidence in younger women, particularly those between 20 and 40. The American Heart Association notes that heart disease is the leading cause of death for women, and heart attacks can occur at younger ages than traditionally thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why so?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Increased incidence:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Research suggests that heart attacks are becoming more prevalent in younger women, with some studies showing a rise in hospitalizations for heart attacks among those under 55. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCAD, a tear in the artery wall, is a common cause of heart attacks in younger women, often affecting those with no other risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Underlying conditions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Young women may be more likely to have underlying conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease that increase their risk of heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Subtle symptoms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women may experience less common or more subtle heart attack symptoms compared to men, potentially leading to delays in seeking medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, older women are at increased risk for heart attacks due to a combination of factors, including the decline in estrogen after menopause, which can increase the risk of heart disease. Additionally, women tend to experience heart attacks at an older age compared to men, and they may be more prone to undiagnosed or untreated risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes. Furthermore, women may have different heart attack symptoms than men, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a more detailed look:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Estrogen Decline:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before menopause, estrogen helps protect women from heart disease. After menopause, estrogen levels drop, increasing the risk of heart disease and heart attacks. This decline in estrogen can also lead to changes in the blood vessels, making it easier for plaque to build up and for blood clots to form, increasing the risk of a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Age and Increased Risk:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women typically experience heart attacks at an older age compared to men. Age itself is an independent risk factor for heart disease, and the risk increases with age. This means that older women are at a higher risk of developing heart disease and experiencing a heart attack due to age-related changes in the heart and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Undiagnosed or Untreated Risk Factors:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women may be more likely to have underlying risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, that go undiagnosed or untreated. This can lead to more severe heart attacks and increased health problems after a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Different Symptoms and Diagnosis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women may experience different symptoms of a heart attack than men, such as shortness of breath, nausea, or dizziness, which can be less obvious and delay diagnosis. This can lead to delayed treatment and potentially worse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mortality rate in women due to heart attack:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women may experience higher mortality rates after a heart attack compared to men due to a combination of factors, including delayed diagnosis, different symptoms, and unique risk factors. Women are often diagnosed later than men, and their heart attack symptoms can be less distinct, leading to a delayed response. Additionally, women may have higher rates of certain conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes, which can contribute to more severe heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons might be as such:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Delayed Diagnosis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women are more likely to experience atypical heart attack symptoms, such as nausea, dizziness, or fatigue, which can be misinterpreted or dismissed, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Different Symptoms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; While chest pain is a common symptom of heart attack in both men and women, women are more likely to experience other symptoms like pain in the neck, jaw, or back, which can be less recognized as heart attack related. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unique Risk Factors:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hormonal changes, particularly after menopause, can increase a woman's risk for heart disease. Additionally, pregnancy-related complications like high blood pressure and gestational diabetes can also elevate a woman's risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Underrepresentation in Research:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Historically, women have been underrepresented in cardiovascular research, leading to a lack of specific knowledge about heart attack risks and outcomes in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Treatments and Procedures:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women are sometimes less likely to receive the same treatments and procedures as men, such as cardiac catheterization, potentially contributing to poorer outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Social Determinants:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Factors like stress, lack of support, and depression can also contribute to poorer outcomes for women after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early symptoms of heart disease in women:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms of heart disease in women can be subtle and may include fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, and dizziness, or even pain in the neck, jaw, or upper back. Women may also experience atypical symptoms like indigestion or heartburn, which are less commonly associated with heart problems in men. Recognizing these early signs is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More detailed information about early symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fatigue:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women may experience unusual fatigue, even after sufficient rest, which can be a significant early symptom of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Shortness of breath:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shortness of breath, even during light activities, can be an indicator of heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Nausea and Vomiting:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some women may experience nausea or vomiting during a heart attack, which can be a more common symptom in women than in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dizziness and Lightheadedness:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting can also be early symptoms of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pain or Discomfort in the Chest:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; While chest pain is a common symptom of heart disease, women may experience a more subtle or dull ache or discomfort, rather than the severe pain often associated with heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pain in the Neck, Jaw, or Upper Back:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some women experience pain or discomfort in the neck, jaw, or upper back, which can be a sign of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Indigestion and Heartburn:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These gastrointestinal symptoms may be a less obvious sign of heart disease in women, but should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sweating:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unexplained sweating, especially cold sweats, can also be a symptom of heart disease or a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Attack Warning Signs That Women May Confuse With Menopause Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 16:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>长寿专家说，一种食物占居住在100的人的饮食量的90％ - 萨里生活 | Long-life expert says one food makes up 90 per cent of diet for people living to 100 - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE41Nkg2eTZLQXphN0R4eGNfVXg2ODIyekZHdmtZWi1MczNQZkYzZ1l1N1RSTzYwZ3VtWmtvakZ2TUluRG55QmRMWkZMQXNSSXFSZ3VjejRTUHpXOXhTZW9EQS1vQmg5bWJRa2ttX0NEU2NBdWhNR3hyNmRXNXdQdW_SAYQBQVVfeXFMUEQxei1Ycl9oc2oxdEpfNUhaVnVEOGVFaXhKd0drbnpzd1BHYmp2VGVKYlNpVUJTS3dVVXhlQW5FYzlhRVl5T0RIM3hNWWlzXzhtX3NVVDdEanctc2lQOFFOM3FLNlpSRXJxQkk3cnQzMVhVN1NnOEhuTzROeHNxRnJwbEx2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An expert specialising in long life says that one food makes up about 90 per cent of the diet for people hitting 100. Dan Buettner said that people who make it up to 100 are, on average, 'eating 90 per cent whole-food, plant-based' diets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buettner has become famous off the back of his work studying Blue Zones - places in the world where more people on average reach 100 than anywhere else. Not only do people live longer there, but they also tend to be healthier as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The five blue zones around the world are Okinawa (Japan), Ikaria (Greece), Loma Linda (USA), Sardinia (Italy), and Nicoya (Costa Rica). It is thought everything from genetics and diet, to lifestyle and even the way they treat the elderly contribute to them living longer, plays a part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buettner has compiled enormous amounts of research into Blue Zones, and believes there are certain patterns that could be applied across the world to help us be healthier and live longer lives. He said: "What people who make to up to 100, on average, are eating 90 per cent whole food, plant based.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The five pillars of every longevity diet in the world are whole grains, what corn and rice, greens and garden vegetables, and the cornerstone of every longevity diet in the world is beans. If you're eating a cup of beans a day, it's probably associated with around four extra years of life expectancy over less healthy sources of protein."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class="instagram-content" data-mod="instagram" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="6"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whole foods are those which have not undergone significant processing, meaning they have no added saturated fat, sugar, or salt. Eating more of them compared to ultra-processed foods (UPFs) can control the number of additives people consume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whole and plant-based foods tend to have more vitamins, nutrients and fibre in them. Around 92 per cent of British people do not consume enough fibre every day, which can help with your cholesterol, blood pressure, and weight. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 50 per cent of the food consumed by the average Brit's daily diet is made up of ultra-processed foods. &lt;a href="https://nhssomerset.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/Moving-towards-more-whole-foods-May-2024.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;The NHS says&lt;/a&gt;: "A common theme within approaches to eating for good health and wellbeing is that they include more whole foods, especially plant-based foods. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The foundation on which the traditional Mediterranean way of eating is based, is in the inclusion of whole foods, which is linked to lower risk of ill health and disease.

Obviously, this is a lofty goal, but I’ve been working toward it by experimenting with the best teeth whitening kits. This isn’t my first foray into teeth whitening. As a teen fresh out of braces, I tried multiple in-office treatments. Since then, I’ve tested everything from overnight whitening strips to charcoal &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-whitening-toothpaste" target="_blank"&gt;toothpaste&lt;/a&gt; that stained my sink an unfortunate shade of black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;’s Favorite Teeth Whitening Kits:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, at-home teeth whitening kits have worked the best for both my budget and lifestyle. Unlike strips, these usually combine technology, like LED lights, with active ingredients like hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide that do the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; whitening. And fortunately, today’s top at-home teeth whitening kits can target both surface stains and deeper discoloration from coffee, tea, wine, soda, and tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we asked three board-certified cosmetic dentists to break down how these whitening kits work, what makes teeth look whiter, how to choose the right one for your needs, and eight options worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In This Story:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Overall:&lt;/strong&gt; Colgate Optic White ComfortFit Teeth Whitening Kit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn hxReXn callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/3ML3AxBWphqb6VvhSbUGhMzPztpb48Vy9n6Kc6VRqNx6cLnLbXkM2rs5ruFanS8uebHr1x5UbMhQ3vv4XHeqtT16CzR2hNPJLverMuCFyPBZ1n5Tk6hbjKdkSibi9fdhYx8VExeB8wk5LChGiXiyQs2zX3V82JY9PRujcuB3jVCyX3Mit5Ysn82xiGaPnXbxwawSq1TyxyTaM35Xsdv7gdfW67gAGTHEU7qJ6igEynhzCPz8Hoyy9tx5Pa85iZwbgLH47EAbDJs4VTexDZExgzYHn4tLUCWYcUWHSn","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Colgate","dangerousHed":"White ComfortFit Teeth Whitening Kit","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":true,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Colgate-ComfortFit-Whitening-Enamel-Android/dp/B0B9HVCMBB/","contentType":"product","productId":"67f7eca0f498a14678196078","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":0,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67f7eca0f498a14678196078","brand":{"name":"Colgate"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Colgate-ComfortFit-Whitening-Enamel-Android/dp/B0B9HVCMBB/","price":"$50","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/3ML3AxBWphqb6VvhSbUGhMzPztpb48Vy9n6Kc6VRqNx6cLnLbXkM2rs5ruFanS8uebHr1x5UbMhQ3vv4XHeqtT16CzR2hNPJLverMuCFyPBZ1n5Tk6hbjKdkSibi9fdhYx8VExeB8wk5LChGiXiyQs2zX3V82JY9PRujcuB3jVCyX3Mit5Ysn82xiGaPnXbxwawSq1TyxyTaM35Xsdv7gdfW67gAGTHEU7qJ6igEynhzCPz8Hoyy9tx5Pa85iZwbgLH47EAbDJs4VTexDZExgzYHn4tLUCWYcUWHSn","reducedPrice":"$30","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US"}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Colgate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67f7eca0f498a14678196078" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;White ComfortFit Teeth Whitening Kit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a level of trust that comes with using Colgate’s dental products, one built over years of growing up with the brand. But just like you, the brand has evolved and now offers whitening kits as part of its repertoire. Cosmetic dentist Dr. Anjali Rajpal explains that Colgate’s whitening kit uses a 9% hydrogen peroxide-based gel, which is a reasonably strong concentration, paired with a flexible LED tray that offers a more tech-forward and comfortable fit. The trays also have a built-in tech element, as each one plugs directly into your iPhone or Android device for power. “It is a little pricier and requires consistent use, but it should generate good results,” she says. The brand recommends using the system for 10 days in a row for best results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: LED whitening light, teeth whitening pen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: N/A&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply a thin layer of the whitening serum to your teeth, then use the LED device to illuminate your smile for 10 minutes. The brand recommends leaving the serum on overnight, but you can also brush your teeth to remove the dried formula sooner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Whitening Strips:&lt;/strong&gt; Crest 3D Whitestrips With Light&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/2axRRXrp1mKAPWK3dnxyrGQvPs4sCEqRUhYf3iu7uPEviegms8mdfnCpMpXa4VgpMbJ9bm6rbfAhxqiPd4kaY5usjgnxD9PyEtRKwymGcjEXZU1SK4NgTCqSX8w1CQuXJofdQeSskS4qHnJAPGw7aX4nTHKHyhquEw3Dz3Khn2ZM494auCtBHYAoWvvn9fB8tTRHUsqsQBAZ3WgzxZcUNXL9wvUUuwQmagTu1jZMWtxAgGnP1gExoo6UmHguoCKqN9ACbbBZecm6BYcDJfS2i6KwnomoUZaRj4","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Crest","dangerousHed":"3D Whitestrips with Light","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Crest-White-Whitestrips-Whitening-Strips/dp/B01M63SQTI/","contentType":"product","productId":"67f7eca083e01f30402c0a76","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":1,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67f7eca083e01f30402c0a76","brand":{"name":"Crest"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Crest-White-Whitestrips-Whitening-Strips/dp/B01M63SQTI/","price":"$70","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/2axRRXrp1mKAPWK3dnxyrGQvPs4sCEqRUhYf3iu7uPEviegms8mdfnCpMpXa4VgpMbJ9bm6rbfAhxqiPd4kaY5usjgnxD9PyEtRKwymGcjEXZU1SK4NgTCqSX8w1CQuXJofdQeSskS4qHnJAPGw7aX4nTHKHyhquEw3Dz3Khn2ZM494auCtBHYAoWvvn9fB8tTRHUsqsQBAZ3WgzxZcUNXL9wvUUuwQmagTu1jZMWtxAgGnP1gExoo6UmHguoCKqN9ACbbBZecm6BYcDJfS2i6KwnomoUZaRj4","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Crest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67f7eca083e01f30402c0a76" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;3D Whitestrips with Light&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: For those more comfortable with strips than trays, this whitening kit from Crest is both convenient and easy to use. Cosmetic dentist Dr. Jaskaren Randhawa explains that it combines a peroxide-based gel containing 10% hydrogen peroxide with an LED light to enhance the whitening process. “A higher at-home concentration of hydrogen peroxide ensures a more effective and noticeable outcome,” she says. “From a clinical perspective, this is a well-balanced product that can safely whiten teeth over time, making it a reliable at-home option. The addition of light accelerates the chemical breakdown of stains, providing faster results compared to traditional strips.” However, Dr. Rajpal notes that they may cause some tooth sensitivity, so keep that in mind if you tend to lean on the sensitive side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Whitening strips, LED light&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: 10 treatments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply the whitening strips to your upper and lower teeth once a day for one hour. After removing the strips, place the light on both the upper and lower teeth until it turns off automatically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Strengthening:&lt;/strong&gt; Snow Teeth Whitening Kit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: For teeth as white as snow, Dr. Randhawa recommends this kit for its ability to “effectively whiten teeth while strengthening and repairing enamel.” She explains that it contains hydroxyapatite to remineralize, rebuild, and strengthen enamel, along with potassium nitrate, which helps reduce tooth sensitivity. “The whitening serum contains a 6% hydrogen peroxide concentration, which breaks down stains, and the formula is sulfate-free,” she adds. And for those who often deal with zingers, she reassures: “This combination of active ingredients whitens teeth while also maintaining enamel health and minimizing sensitivity.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide, carbamide peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: LED whitening mouthpiece, teeth whitening pen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: N/A&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Brush your teeth, apply the Diamond Serum using the wand, then wear the LED mouthpiece for 10 to 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Sensitive Teeth:&lt;/strong&gt; Moon The Teeth Whitening Device System&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/F4467UzwXghrU5ph4K6DQmB4RqkwuZnxcTmTXbQYi3FecjKPhGRpLtNRFBihvWATwxvwDSnn54ZUU5rjvLoGmZhJTFyZ4x3CfbWskYRvZSADtKC8rzBdncEEaDyypBEoERdPbYvwJUx3SUfHEZ6VHTAjU9xAviGsGrXjExqKPUeRziTj3x7uGTAjq6ae9JoJGzpPma5kqgZ1GfneHZU7BoqZjtTksFLJTj59xjEibjCgFkdroStaokqV6p2JmRSybFfmEQgpSWsRyfQkZVTtRo3Z4tY6","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"","dangerousHed":"The Teeth Whitening Device System","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"NORDSTROM","offerUrl":"https://www.nordstrom.com/s/moon-the-teeth-whitening-device-system/7459709","contentType":"product","productId":"67f7eca14260c27ad9b268e0","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":3,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67f7eca14260c27ad9b268e0","brand":{"name":""},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.nordstrom.com/s/moon-the-teeth-whitening-device-system/7459709","price":"$90","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/F4467UzwXghrU5ph4K6DQmB4RqkwuZnxcTmTXbQYi3FecjKPhGRpLtNRFBihvWATwxvwDSnn54ZUU5rjvLoGmZhJTFyZ4x3CfbWskYRvZSADtKC8rzBdncEEaDyypBEoERdPbYvwJUx3SUfHEZ6VHTAjU9xAviGsGrXjExqKPUeRziTj3x7uGTAjq6ae9JoJGzpPma5kqgZ1GfneHZU7BoqZjtTksFLJTj59xjEibjCgFkdroStaokqV6p2JmRSybFfmEQgpSWsRyfQkZVTtRo3Z4tY6","sellerName":"NORDSTROM","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67f7eca14260c27ad9b268e0" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;The Teeth Whitening Device System&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: For a whitening system that is free from potentially harmful ingredients such as SLS, SLES, parabens, artificial flavors, and animal by-products, consider Moon. Dr. Randhawa explains that the system uses a hydrogen peroxide–based gel with a 6% concentration, combined with LED light technology to help accelerate the whitening process. So no matter how much coffee or red wine you’ve had over the years, “this combination effectively targets surface stains,” she says. However, Dr. Rajpal notes that it has limited clinical proof compared to other kits, so it may not deliver results as dramatically or as quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Whitening strips, LED whitening mouthpiece&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: 56 dissolvable strips&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply the whitening strips to your upper and lower teeth, then insert the mouthpiece and press the button to turn it on. It will automatically turn off after five minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Surface Stains:&lt;/strong&gt; Auraglow Teeth Whitening Kit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: This kit strikes the perfect balance between affordability and effectiveness. It uses a 35% carbamide peroxide-based gel in tandem with an LED light to accelerate the whitening process. While the results may not be instant, Dr. Rajpal notes that it “delivers results gradually,” making it a reliable pick for those who prefer a gentler approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Carbamide peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Carbamide peroxide gel syringe, LED whitening mouthpiece&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: 20&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: After brushing your teeth and charging the LED whitening light, apply a thin line of gel to the top and bottom of the tray. Insert the tray, tap the logo to turn it on, and wear the device for 30 minutes for best results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Deep Discoloration:&lt;/strong&gt; iSmile Teeth Whitening Kit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re “so over” strips, Dr. Wagner says LED mouthpieces like this one, which keep the whitening agent in place, often perform better. “Think about your lifestyle and your level of sensitivity. If you have 10 to 15 minutes a day and want a deeper, all-over brightening, something like the iSmile LED tray system can be a great fit.” He explains that this kit combines a carbamide peroxide gel with a light-activated tray to help ensure even coverage across all your teeth. “It’s a solid option for people looking for a deeper, more uniform whitening effect at home.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Carbamide peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Carbamide peroxide gel syringe, LED whitening mouthpiece&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: 22&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Remove the cap from the whitening gel syringe and apply 0.3 to 0.5 mL of gel to the inner front surface of the tray on both the top and bottom. Insert the tray and light into your mouth, pressing it firmly against your front teeth. Press the power button to turn on the light and whiten for 10 minutes. Afterward, remove the tray and rinse your mouth with warm water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Budget:&lt;/strong&gt; Ollm Teeth Whitening Kit Gel Pen Strips&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn hxReXn callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/VDkSwjASRpoWbgzpTn4G66ogYkVaetFao7Yon2BgBMEnpCSrYvAEPKPCyDNCbZoHTErpC3uGSHwyFUHJr25e2ApMAKt6j6AiPaj9HXVT1dwaL7GsRmvFqEt7MiMmcJzM1PA9eMaHnDBeMHnP74KGCwKuS4kphTmFmK7ZKBt15ZpwLcT3hkyUGjEUMrFhML1HgsC8d1DKSyPUjDuWyDap6G3snF8ySJJpeRxDDCXCTHTNaQdxCb9VXKoB18QQQbcBuvH82bGxs8vwHouau7gPg","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Ollm","dangerousHed":"Teeth Whitening Kit Gel Pen Strips","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/OLLM-Teeth-Whitening-Kit-Strips/dp/B0CCT7582J/","contentType":"product","productId":"67f7eca1cd8c5787bfe9f559","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":6,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67f7eca1cd8c5787bfe9f559","brand":{"name":"Ollm"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/OLLM-Teeth-Whitening-Kit-Strips/dp/B0CCT7582J/","price":"$30","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/VDkSwjASRpoWbgzpTn4G66ogYkVaetFao7Yon2BgBMEnpCSrYvAEPKPCyDNCbZoHTErpC3uGSHwyFUHJr25e2ApMAKt6j6AiPaj9HXVT1dwaL7GsRmvFqEt7MiMmcJzM1PA9eMaHnDBeMHnP74KGCwKuS4kphTmFmK7ZKBt15ZpwLcT3hkyUGjEUMrFhML1HgsC8d1DKSyPUjDuWyDap6G3snF8ySJJpeRxDDCXCTHTNaQdxCb9VXKoB18QQQbcBuvH82bGxs8vwHouau7gPg","reducedPrice":"$20","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US"}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Ollm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67f7eca1cd8c5787bfe9f559" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Teeth Whitening Kit Gel Pen Strips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: Dr. Wagner describes this kit as a “clever hybrid,” combining the precision of a pen with the ease of a dissolvable strip. “It’s great for targeting specific spots or touching up after a longer whitening cycle, and users love the convenience and low mess factor.” Unlike many at-home kits that require bulky devices or a big time commitment, this one is low-maintenance and travel-friendly, offering flexibility without the need for chargers or accessories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide gel syringe, LED whitening mouthpiece&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: N/A&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply a thin line of gel to the top and bottom of the tray, then insert it into your mouth.

Whether you’re tackling surface stains or deeper discoloration from coffee or wine, you’ll notice a brighter smile after just 15 minutes. For best results, the brand recommends using it consistently. Each kit includes 14 days’ worth of whitening via whitening strips as well as a whitening pen for touch ups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Sodium hydroxide, carbamide peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Whitening strips, LED whitening mouthpiece, carbamide peroxide whitening pen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: 14&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: N/A&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything You Need to Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="Doteethwhiteningkitswork" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do teeth whitening kits actually work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer: yes. The long answer, according to our experts, is that many teeth whitening kits are effective, but their success depends on the product type, ingredients, and the individual’s dental condition, including factors like enamel thickness and natural tooth shade. Dr. Randhawa recommends kits that contain hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which are commonly used in professional-grade treatments and are generally effective at lightening teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she notes that results vary based on the severity of staining, how consistently the product is used, and whether the stains are intrinsic (deep within the tooth) or extrinsic (on the surface). “Non-peroxide kits may not work as well, and some may contain preservatives that could potentially become acidic,” warns Dr. Rajpal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Randhawa also adds, “It is important to note that whitening thin or gray teeth can be particularly challenging, as these teeth may not respond as effectively. While over-the-counter kits can offer more gradual results, professional treatments typically provide faster and more dramatic improvements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Areteethwhiteningkitssafetouse" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are the best teeth whitening kits safe to use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When used correctly, most over-the-counter teeth whitening kits are safe,” says Dr. Randhawa. However, she emphasizes that it’s important to follow the instructions carefully to avoid overuse, which can lead to tooth sensitivity or gum irritation. For those with sensitive teeth or gums, she recommends choosing a kit specifically formulated for sensitivity, plus consulting with a dentist before beginning any whitening treatment. “Caution should be exercised with DIY whitening methods, as improper use can cause damage. It’s also crucial to avoid swallowing the product, as some ingredients may be harmful if ingested.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Whatmakesteethwhiter" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes teeth look whiter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Randhawa explains that teeth appear whiter when surface stains are removed, revealing the natural color of the enamel. Common causes of staining include foods and drinks such as coffee, tea, and red wine, as well as smoking, all of which can lead to the buildup of extrinsic stains on the enamel. “The brightness of teeth is also influenced by the thickness and quality of enamel, which is the outer protective layer of the tooth,” she says. Over time, enamel naturally thins due to aging, bruxism (teeth grinding), or prolonged exposure to acidic foods and beverages. “This thinning exposes more of the yellowish dentin beneath, contributing to a duller appearance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitening treatments can help restore the look of your smile by either removing surface stains or reducing the visibility of yellowing. Whitening gels with active ingredients like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide contribute to this process by penetrating the enamel. “These compounds work by breaking down stain molecules and chemically bleaching the enamel, lightening the overall tooth shade. Scientific studies have shown that hydrogen peroxide, in particular, is an effective bleaching agent, as it releases oxygen molecules that break apart the chromophores, color-producing molecules, in stains, resulting in visibly brighter teeth,” explains Dr. Randhawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to whitening, treatments that strengthen and protect enamel, such as remineralizing agents or fluoride treatments, can help preserve tooth structure and prevent further discoloration, enhancing long-term results. Dr. Randhawa also stresses the importance of routine dental cleanings for maintaining a bright smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Howtochooseateethwhiteningkit" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to Choose a Teeth-Whitening Kit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for faster whitening and more intense results, Dr. Rajpal recommends choosing a hydrogen peroxide gel. “However, if you prefer gentler whitening with longer-lasting results and less risk of sensitivity, you may prefer a carbamide peroxide gel. The most beneficial kits are those that contain either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which are the same active ingredients used by dentists, just in lower concentrations,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rajpal also notes that whitening strips are easy to apply and mess-free, making them a good option for those who want simplicity. LED kits may require more setup, but they often provide a stronger and more customizable whitening experience. Gel pens are convenient for quick touch-ups, though they may not deliver long-lasting results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When selecting a whitening kit, it’s important to consider factors such as the type of stains you’re targeting (surface level versus deeper stains), your level of tooth sensitivity, and how much time you’re willing to commit to the treatment. Dr. Randhawa also advises checking whether the product has the ADA (American Dental Association) Seal of Acceptance or other professional endorsements to ensure its safety and effectiveness. “It’s important to note that while whitening kits are effective for removing surface stains, they are not designed to treat deeper, intrinsic stains. These types of stains typically require more advanced in-office procedures,” says Dr. Randhawa. Additionally, she reminds us that dental restorations such as bondings, crowns, and veneers will not whiten with these treatments. “Any whitening effect will apply only to natural tooth enamel. Lastly, if you have any concerns or pre-existing dental issues, it’s always a good idea to consult with your dentist before choosing a whitening kit to ensure the best and safest approach for your needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="meettheexperts" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE4yZHZBNDNvamR6bkpfZzgxdTVnbXJlWFoxYW9YbVlDZVB6bXZ5cnRYWGpZb1hLWDBVaWZfajJtVmZGVE1xMkpVM190SGJmUmwyb1l5LWdiNTB5RS1ERUtRMk9xZ1p3QQ</guid></item><item><title>前卫生官员批评小RFK小。 | Former top health official criticizes RFK Jr. for downplaying measles deaths - CBS News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOM29BX3BSMzNVNWp5ZmdLTEdCbGo4Rmk4MzRVM1ZkdFRuMzJyQ0gwalAwcllrbTdjVXhzaUpvejRJWGh3dWltZzl3RWhLRlRfck9mTHpQcW5IU1EtaEpNUEQ0WUFYdWJGSXhVb0gxV1FJSGtPXzdKa2ZaOHh0Y1pheVJCazFjZk5fV0NEdnRRQXV5R0pfY21yMFJrLWZLRF8zVV9ORnl3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The former top vaccines official at the Food and Drug Administration criticized Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-sweeping-cuts-health-programs-employees-exclusive-interview/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. for downplaying the deaths of unvaccinated children from measles, amid this year's &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;record outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To dismiss children's deaths due to infectious diseases that are preventable by vaccines as just expected or not a big deal, that's just not acceptable to me," said Dr. Peter Marks, in an interview airing Sunday on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weekly measles cases have climbed to the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-cases-weekly-top-90-first-time-years-cdc/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;highest levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; seen in the U.S. since a 2019 wave of the virus, which had been the worst in decades. Three deaths have been linked to this year's measles outbreak, including two unvaccinated children in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic," Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also contrasted U.S. measles case numbers to Europe, where thousands more infections and dozens of deaths have been reported in recent months. Kennedy has also used the comparison as evidence that his response to the outbreak was a success.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marks criticized Kennedy's comparison, noting that Europe's figures "includes Romania, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, other places that have less robust public health efforts than we do." He also said that "even a single death in this country from measles, it's just— it's just not excusable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's just not the right thing to do. We should be comparing our measles response now to what we accomplished during the first two decades of the 20th century, until the 2019 measles outbreak, which is, we shouldn't be having any deaths from measles," said Marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Changes at the FDA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before he was &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-top-vaccine-official-peter-marks-forced-out-decries-rfk-jr-misinformation-and-lies/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;ousted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by Kennedy's aides, Marks was the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which regulates vaccines and other medical products derived from living sources. He was also the architect of the Operation Warp Speed effort to speed the development of COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He warned that it is now "challenging in this environment" for some of his former colleagues in the federal government to endorse vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks," Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days after Marks submitted his resignation letter, Kennedy implemented &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/job-cuts-federal-health-agencies-rfk-jr/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;steep layoffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and forced resignations across the FDA, as part of a sweeping restructuring of the nation's health agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts have forced federal health officials to confront difficult decisions, including over &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-food-drug-inspections-layoffs/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;how to prioritize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; fewer food and drug safety inspections. Marks praised the remaining staff at the agency as "heroes in public health" who are "struggling because there's a lot to be done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They keep tabs on the infections. They make sure that the vaccines that are coming in for approvals might work their way through. They make sure that outbreaks are investigated. Those people are continuing to do their job the best they possibly can," Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marks said the delay to an approval decision on Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to be greenlighted earlier this month by the FDA, was concerning. And he warned that his own ouster could signal a change to the agency's approach to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why would you de-emphasize something that is so basic to public health," Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Does a disservice to pseudoscience"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marks said he never interacted directly with Kennedy as secretary. He also said he did not know much about the administration's efforts to reopen research into the repeatedly debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, amid broader plans to determine the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/peter-marks-fda-official-rfk-jr-false-hope-on-autism/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cause of autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about Kennedy's claim that "we know it is an environmental toxin" causing autism, Marks said it was "very rare for scientists to speak in absolutes." Kennedy has been criticized for years for &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/rfk-kennedy-politifact-lie-of-year-2023-autism-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines cause autism, among a range of unfounded claims he has espoused about the danger posed by immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most things are not that black and white, and we don't speak in absolutes. Whereas pseudoscientists find it very easy to speak in absolutes because they're not actually looking to use science for the benefit of mankind, they're usually using science for their own benefit," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marks said he was familiar with the past work of Dr. Mark Geier and his son, David Geier, who The Washington Post reported has been tasked by Kennedy this year to revisit a past Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have a firm and fixed notion that vaccines cause autism. So it's very hard for me to see how we're going to get to any other idea than vaccines cause autism," Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describing the work by Geier and his father as pseudoscience "does a disservice to pseudoscience," Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Geier was &lt;a href="https://www.mdcourts.gov/sites/default/files/unreported-opinions/0709s14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;fined by&lt;/a&gt; Maryland regulators for practicing medicine without a license, including for prescribing the drug Lupron to autistic children. Lupron is also used as a chemical castration drug for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30047834/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;sex offenders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know. I can't even conceive as a physician of how he thought that could be a good idea," said Marks.&lt;/p&gt;

This breakthrough allows scientists to observe how pain signals travel from peripheral neurons to the brain for the first time outside the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model, called an assembloid, responds to pain-inducing stimuli and reflects the effects of genetic mutations known to alter pain perception. This innovation could revolutionize drug discovery for pain relief, particularly for conditions like chronic pain or hypersensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Pain Pathway Recreated:&lt;/strong&gt; Four connected brain and spinal organoids simulate human pain signal transmission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Discovery Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; The assembloid enables testing of pain-inducing chemicals and potential pain-blocking drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gene-Specific Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Mutations in Nav1.7 sodium channels altered wave-like neural activity, mimicking pain disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Stanford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanford Medicine investigators have replicated, in a lab dish, one of humans’ most prominent nervous pathways for sensing pain. This nerve circuit transmits sensations from the body’s skin to the brain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once further processed in the brain, these signals will translate into our subjective experience, including the uncomfortable feeling of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advance promises to accelerate what has been slow progress in understanding how pain signals are processed in humans and how best to alleviate pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108730"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Missing in these assembloids, importantly, were organoids representing other brain regions that are critical to the discomfort experienced by people who are in pain. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study to be published April 9 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, scientists led by Sergiu Pasca, MD, the Kenneth T. Norris, Jr., Professor II of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, describe their successful assembly of four miniaturized parts of the human nervous system to reconstitute what’s known as the ascending sensory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peripheral sensation of pain travels to the brain in a relay involving nerve cells, or neurons, centered in four different regions of the ascending sensory pathway: the dorsal root ganglion, dorsal spinal cord, thalamus and somatosensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can now model this pathway non-invasively,” said Pasca, the study’s senior author. “That will, we hope, help us learn how to better treat pain disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead co-authors of the study are postdoctoral scholars Ji-il Kim, PhD, and Kent Imaizumi, MD, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human pain has often proven tough to study in laboratory animals, said Pasca, who is also the Bonnie Uytengsu and Family Director of the Stanford Brain Organogenesis Program. “Their pain pathways are in some respects different from ours,” he said. “Yet these animals experience pain. Our dish-based construct doesn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now nobody has been able to watch information being transmitted through this entire pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pasca and his colleagues witnessed never-before-seen waves of electrical activity travel from the first component of their construct all the way to the last, and they were able to enhance or disrupt these wavelike patterns by gene alterations or chemical stimulation of elements of the circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better drugs needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pain is a huge health problem,” said Vivianne Tawfik, MD, PhD, associate professor of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some 116 million Americans — more than one in three people in the United States — are dealing with chronic pain of one kind or another,” she said. This pain often persists even when observable damage is no longer evident, possibly due to lasting changes in the ascending sensory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet treatments for chronic pain are few and far from ideal, she said: “I can’t even tell you how sad it is to sit in front of a patient who’s suffering from chronic pain after we’ve tried everything and there’s nothing left in our arsenal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most “pain medications” aren’t licensed for pain per se but instead borrowed from psychiatrists’ or sleep-disorder specialists’ medicine cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective painkillers in the bunch are opioid drugs, which have the severe drawback of being habit-forming, leaving chronic-pain sufferers susceptible to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the sensory pathway piece by piece&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tawfik said she thinks the team’s new construct is highly relevant to the study of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The pathway they’ve reconstructed is the most important one for conveying pain-related information,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regions that compose the ascending sensory pathway are linked by three sets of neuronal connections: The first set relays sensory information from the skin through the dorsal root ganglion to the spinal cord; a second set of neurons passes the signals from the spinal cord to a brain structure called the thalamus; and the third relays this information from the thalamus to the somatosensory cortex for further processing of the signal originating from the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasca has pioneered the creation of what he calls regionalized neural organoids, grown in a lab dish from stem cells and representing various distinct brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Pasca has pushed this technology forward, pairing organoids of one type with organoids of another type in a dish so they fuse into what he’s named assembloids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons from one organoid, via growth or migration, can penetrate the other organoid to form working circuits functionally similar to, or even identical to, those they’re meant to mimic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been finding that we don’t need to know the details of assembly of these circuits as long as we make the parts and put them together correctly,” Pasca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you put the organoids together, the cells find each other and connect in a meaningful way, giving rise to new features.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Pasca and his colleagues developed human organoids recapitulating the ascending sensory pathway’s four key regions, then fused them together in series to form an assembloid mimicking the pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting with cells from skin samples from volunteers, the team first transformed them into induced pluripotent stem cells, which are essentially de-differentiated cells that can be guided to become virtually any cell type in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used chemical signals to coax these cells into aggregating into tiny balls, called neural organoids, representing each of the four regions of the pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each organoid was a bit less than 1/10 inch in diameter and contained close to a million cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasca and his colleagues lined up the organoids of those four different types side by side and waited. About 100 days later, they had fused into an assembloid almost 2/5 of an inch long — “They look like tiny sausage links,” Pasca said — and consisting of nearly 4 million cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s less than 1/42,000th of the number in an adult human brain, which contains about 170 billion cells, Pasca noted. But the construct recapitulated the circuitry involved in the pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that the assembloids’ constituent organoids were anatomically connected: Neurons from the first had formed working connections with neurons from the second, the second with the third and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the entire circuit, from the sensory organoid to the cortical organoid, worked as a unit. Once all four organoids had sat beside one another in the flask for about 100 days, patterns of spontaneous, synchronized, directional signaling within the assembloid began to emerge: Neuronal activity in the sensory organoid tripped off similar action in the spinal organoid, then in the thalamic organoid and finally in the cortical organoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’d never have been able to see this wavelike synchrony if you couldn’t watch all four organoids, connected, simultaneously,” Pasca said. “The brain is more than the sum of its parts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot peppers and sodium channels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemicals known to induce pain increased the wavelike activity in the assembloids. Stimulating the sensory organoid with capsaicin — the ingredient in chili peppers that produces a burning sensation in our mouths — triggered immediate waves of neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rare genetic mutations in an ion-exchange protein found on the surfaces of peripheral sensory neurons can lead to debilitating hypersensitivity to pain or, conversely, a life-threatening inability to experience pain — radically increasing the physical dangers, routine or otherwise, that life serves up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein in question, Nav1.7, is a particular type of sodium channel that, the researchers observed, abounds on peripheral sensory neurons but is scarce elsewhere. The scientists made an assembloid with its initial, sensory component’s normal version of Nav1.7 replaced by the mutant pain-hypersensitivity version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting mutant sensory assembloids displayed more-frequent waves of spontaneous nervous transmission from the sensory through the spinal and thalamic organoids to the cerebral-cortex organoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pasca’s team instead rendered the same sodium channel in the sensory organoid non-functional, they got a surprise: Firing from that organoid in response to a pain-inducing chemical continued — but the synchronized wavelike transmission of pain information through the circuit mysteriously vanished. The firing was now out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sensory neurons still fired,” Pasca said. “But they failed to engage the rest of the network in a coordinated manner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing in these assembloids, importantly, were organoids representing other brain regions that are critical to the discomfort experienced by people who are in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The assembloids themselves don’t ‘feel’ any pain,” Pasca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They transmit nervous signals that need to be further processed by other centers in our brains for us to experience the unpleasant, aversive feeling of pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assembloids, after only a few months of their assembly, represent an early phase of fetal development, he said. Their immediate use would be in studying neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with autism are often hypersensitive to pain and to sensory stimulation in general, and some autism-associated genes are active in the sensory neurons of the ascending sensory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasca said that his lab is working on ways to accelerate the development of the assembloids to better understand how the pathway they represent works — or doesn’t — in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nav1.7 appears to exist mostly on the surfaces of peripheral pain-sensing neurons,” Pasca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think screening for drugs that tame sensory organoids’ ability to trigger excessive or inappropriate waves of neuronal transmission through our assembloid, without affecting the brain’s reward circuitry as opioid drugs do — which is why they’re addictive — could lead to better-targeted therapies for pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford University’s office of technology licensing has filed a patent for intellectual property associated with this assembloid, with Pasca, Kim and Imaizumi named as co-inventors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher from the University of North Carolina contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grants R01MH107800, R01NS128028 and CNCDP-K12), the NYSCF Robertson Stem Cell Society, the Stanford Human Brain Organogenesis Project, the Kwan Research Fund, the Senkut Research Funds and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#31565e5d555c505f53714245505f575e43551f545544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bruce Goldman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bruce Goldman – Stanford&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08808-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Human assembloid model of the ascending neural sensory pathway&lt;/a&gt;” by Sergiu Pasca et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human assembloid model of the ascending neural sensory pathway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somatosensory pathways convey crucial information about pain, touch, itch and body part movement from peripheral organs to the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite substantial needs to understand how these pathways assemble and to develop pain therapeutics, clinical translation remains challenging. This is probably related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models of the polysynaptic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we established a human ascending somatosensory assembloid (hASA), a four-part assembloid generated from human pluripotent stem cells that integrates somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids to model the spinothalamic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcriptomic profiling confirmed the presence of key cell types of this circuit. Rabies tracing and calcium imaging showed that sensory neurons connect to dorsal spinal cord neurons, which further connect to thalamic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following noxious chemical stimulation, calcium imaging of hASA demonstrated a coordinated response. In addition, extracellular recordings and imaging revealed synchronized activity across the assembloid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, loss of the sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7, which causes pain insensitivity, disrupted synchrony across hASA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a gain-of-function &lt;em&gt;SCN9A&lt;/em&gt; variant associated with extreme pain disorder induced hypersynchrony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experiments demonstrated the ability to functionally assemble the essential components of the human sensory pathway, which could accelerate our understanding of sensory circuits and facilitate therapeutic development.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 14:59:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBCcWw4YXp5WENwSjRaUHIyOVYwQUVDZjBDWFNLelFFNi1EbjdZWFRQWnNTODMxZW5DWE10MjdSOVZGeGRQREZmcHBwZEltV2FNbmQxc202YXNCN29XOUpFYXpHdjNNVWdSOXcxVk8tbw</guid></item><item><title>为什么有时您直到为时已晚才感到痛苦 - 神经科学新闻 | Why You Sometimes Don’t Feel Pain Until It’s Too Late - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE4yMUwzMVFMSWtWQzJDenZCOWRrQ000RjZLM3RJTkVFZ01BeWFyWmF1NjFTeUJnTUwzYko1U0tyZi1xSlA5eFdwRmd2VUFHNXRwQTdYYnphSmpaUVZGSTJJWDVwbzlvR1JWUk9Tbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research highlights how the brain’s own chemistry can suppress pain, explaining why severely injured individuals, like WWII soldiers, sometimes feel little discomfort. The key lies in a brain region called the periaqueductal grey (PAG), which dampens pain signals before they reach conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This system releases enkephalins, natural opioids that mimic the effects of morphine. Everyday experiences like intense focus, stress, or exercise may tap into this internal pain control, opening avenues for non-opioid pain management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Painkillers:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain produces enkephalins that suppress pain similarly to morphine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Periaqueductal Grey (PAG):&lt;/strong&gt; This brain structure modulates pain perception by blocking incoming pain signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyday Triggers:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise, stress, feeding, and sex may boost the brain’s pain-relief system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the second world war, the physician &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pain-research/articles/10.3389/fpain.2022.961304/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Henry Beecher&lt;/a&gt; observed that some of his soldier patients, despite being injured on the battlefield, required no strong painkillers to manage their pain. In some cases, the injury was as severe as losing part of a limb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A truly remarkable phenomenon had come into play – the effects of fear, stress and emotion on the brain had switched off their pain. But how does this work – and how can we use it to our advantage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all struggle with pain at times. The burning of indigestion, the wince of a scald from the kettle. The sharp stabbing of a sliced finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108694"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pag-pain-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Besides this, stressful situations, feeding and sex might also affect the activity of enkephalins and other related compounds. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite its unpleasantness, pain has a critically important purpose, designed to protect the body rather than harm it. A fundamental concept to first understand is that you do not detect pain – it is a sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sensation that your brain has created – from information it receives from the countless neurons (nerve cells) which supply your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These specialised neurons are called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21041958/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nociceptors&lt;/a&gt; – they detect stimuli which are noxious, or potentially damaging to the body. This &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29212893/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stimulation&lt;/a&gt; might range from a mechanical cut or crush injury, to extreme hot or cold temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you touch a hot iron, or stand on a sharp nail, the correct reaction is to move your hand or foot away from it. The brain responds to pain by initiating muscle contractions in your arm or leg. In doing so, any further damage is averted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course of information, rushing along one neuron to another in a relay, is carried as electrical currents called action potentials. These begin at the skin, travel along nerve highways and into the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the information reaches the uppermost level of the brain – the cerebral cortex – a sensation of pain is generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blocking pain signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many different factors can interfere with this transmission of information – we don’t perceive pain if the route to the cortex is blocked. Take the use of anaesthetics, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local anaesthetics are injected directly into the skin to deactivate nociceptors (like lidocaine) – perhaps in A+E to perform stitches. Other agents induce a loss of consciousness – these are general anaesthetics, for more extensive surgical operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain is also a very variable experience. Commonly, we ask patients to quantify their pain by giving a value along a scale of nought to ten. What one person would consider a five out of ten pain, another might consider a seven – and another a two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients are born without the ability to sense pain – this rare condition is called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11204641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;congenital analgesia&lt;/a&gt;. You might think this confers an advantage, but the truth is quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These individuals will be unaware of circumstances where their bodies are being damaged, and can end up sustaining more profound injuries, or missing them entirely and suffering the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to trick your brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is more extraordinary is that we all possess an innate ability to control our pain levels. In fact, a natural painkiller is found deep within the nervous system itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret lies in a structure located in the very middle of your brain: the &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00998.2014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;periaqueductal grey (PAG)&lt;/a&gt;. This small, heart-shaped region contains neurons whose role is to alter incoming pain signals reaching the cerebral cortex. In doing so, it is able to dampen down any pain that would otherwise be experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider this in practice using the extreme example of the battlefield. This is an instance where sensing pain might actually prove more of a hindrance than of help. It might hamper a soldier’s ability to run, or assist comrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In temporarily numbing the pain, the soldier becomes able to escape the dangerous environment and seek refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we encounter many examples of this ability coming into action in our everyday routines. Ever picked something in the kitchen that you suddenly realise is extremely hot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes that casserole dish or saucepan descends to the floor, but sometimes we are able to hold on just long enough to transfer it to the stove-top. This action may be underpinned by the PAG shutting off the sensation of clasping something too hot to handle, just long enough to prevent dropping it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The substances which generate this effect are called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32422213/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;enkephalins&lt;/a&gt;. They are produced in many different areas of the brain (including the PAG) and spinal cord, and may have similar actions to strong analgesics such as morphine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also been suggested that long term or &lt;em&gt;chronic&lt;/em&gt; pain – which is persistent and not useful to the body – might arise as a result of abnormalities within this natural analgesic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This begs the question: how might you go about hacking your own nervous system to produce an analgesic effect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is growing evidence to suggest that the release of painkilling enkephalins can be enhanced in a variety of different ways. Exercise &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38048912/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;is one example&lt;/a&gt; – one of the reasons why prescribed exercise might be able to work wonders for aches and pains (backache for instance) instead of popping paracetamols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides this, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28781901/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stressful situations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-024-01099-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;feeding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27417433/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; might also affect the activity of enkephalins and other related compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how could we go about it? Take up strength or endurance training? Alleviate our stress? Good food? Good sex? While more work is needed to clarify a role for these options in pain management, their reward might be greater than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain remains a complex, poorly understood experience, but the future is bright. Only last month, the FDA approved the use of a new medication Journavx for managing acute pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works by switching off nociceptors in the peripheral nervous system, and therefore preventing pain signals getting to the brain. This represents a potential new breakthrough in a world which has become dependent on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-025-00022-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;addictive opioid medications&lt;/a&gt;, such as morphine and fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing new painkilling treatments relies on the work of pain researchers to help unravel the intricate neuronal circuitry and function. There is no denying that this is going to be difficult task. But in considering the neuroscience of how our bodies generate and suppress pain, we can hope to understand how they can act as their own healers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain and conscious awareness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/dan-baumgardt-1451396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dan Baumgardt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Dan Baumgardt – The Conversation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 14:33:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE4yMUwzMVFMSWtWQzJDenZCOWRrQ000RjZLM3RJTkVFZ01BeWFyWmF1NjFTeUJnTUwzYko1U0tyZi1xSlA5eFdwRmd2VUFHNXRwQTdYYnphSmpaUVZGSTJJWDVwbzlvR1JWUk9Tbw</guid></item><item><title>兰开斯特县州外访客的确认麻疹病例 -  WGAL | Confirmed measles case in out-of-state visitor in Lancaster County - WGAL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPMWgta1FRSkZ3UzdqNlZveUdXQ0phYS1pXzJlOUw1MmpIVXlzOUhINGtwQXFDdm5NXzVWRWJjOG5vZEY2a3RhMmtLQWNXNF9wV1pDTmluWUlpaVBadm1saGI3cGtvd25mbjNGR09INXJrekNNNXNpbURJVmRBZDBoYUN1WHFmNGlEbzhHd2o2T0prVDdOQjdlSG15dERRYlZCNTYwT3NvckUxZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content--body-wrapper"&gt;

													WE’RE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS OUT OF HARRISBURG. BUT FIRST LET’S START WITH METEOROLOGIST MARYELLEN PANN WITH A CHECK OF THE STORM TEAM FORECAST. A LITTLE BIT DRIER TODAY. DEFINITELY DRIER TODAY. YES. WE’RE GETTING A BREAK. WE HAVE A LOT OF CLOUD COVER OUT THERE RIGHT NOW, BUT I DO EXPECT THE SUNSHINE TO INCREASE AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY. LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR YORK SKYCAM. AGAIN, YOU SEE THE OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUDS THERE. IT IS DRY. JUST WILL BE STARTING THE DAY WITH THESE OVERCAST CONDITIONS, BUT HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING. IT WILL HELP TO SCOUR OUT THE CLOUDS A BIT, TO GIVE US A LITTLE MORE SUNSHINE THAT WILL MIX IN, ESPECIALLY LATER THIS AFTERNOON. YOU CAN SEE THE FLAG BLOWING THERE. THE WINDS ARE INCREASING AND WILL BE BREEZY TODAY. LOW PRESSURE CONTINUES TO LIFT TO THE NORTHEAST. HIGH PRESSURE IS BUILDING IN FROM THE WEST SO THAT SQUEEZE PLAY BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS, CREATING SOME BREEZY WINDS AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY. TEMPERATURES RIGHT NOW IN THE MID 40S ACROSS THE BOARD, REALLY HAVEN’T MOVED A WHOLE LOT BECAUSE OF THAT CLOUD COVER. THERE YOU CAN SEE THE WINDS PICKING UP OUT OF THE NORTHWEST ANYWHERE FROM 10 TO 15MPH, AND THEY’LL INCREASE TO ABOUT 10 TO 20 AS WE GO THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HOURS. SO DECREASING CLOUDS, A LITTLE MORE SUNSHINE THIS AFTERNOON, EVEN SOME PARTIAL CLEARING TOWARDS EVENING. AND LOOK AT THE TEMPERATURES YESTERDAY. WE ONLY HIT 50 SOME AREAS IN THE 40S. WE’RE GOING TO HIT NEAR 60 DEGREES TODAY, SO CERTAINLY GOING TO FEEL MUCH NICER OUTSIDE. I DO HAVE MORE RAIN CHANCES AS WE HEAD BACK TO THE WORKWEEK. I’LL TALK ABOUT THAT THREAT COMING UP IN MY FULL FORECAST. ALL RIGHT. THANKS. MARY ELLEN, WE’RE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS THIS MORNING OUT OF HARRISBURG. OVERNIGHT, CREWS WERE ON THE SCENE OF A FIRE AT THE GOVERNOR’S RESIDENCE ON FRONT STREET. DISPATCHERS SAY THE CALL CAME IN JUST AFTER TWO THIS MORNING. THEY SAY NO INJURIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. WE’RE STILL WORKING TO LEARN THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE. NEWS EIGHT WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS STORY ON AIR AND ONLINE. IN LANCASTER, POLICE ARE LOOKING ARE INVESTIGATING TWO SHOOTINGS. THE FIRST INCIDENT HAPPENED AT AROUND 915 FRIDAY NIGHT NEAR 200 CORAL STREET. POLICE FOUND ONE VEHICLE THAT WAS HIT BY GUNFIRE. THE SECOND SHOOTING WAS REPORTED AROUND 11:00 FRIDAY NIGHT AT THE 600 BLOCK OF NORTH QUEEN STREET, NEAR LANCASTER. GENERAL HEALTH AND PENN MEDICINE PARK. POLICE FOUND BULLET CASINGS AT THE SCENE BUT DID NOT FIND DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OR ANYONE INJURED. BOTH SHOOTINGS ARE BEING INVESTIGATED. THIS MORNING, POLICE IN CAMP HILL ARE LOOKING FOR A PERSON WHO STOLE TWO GARGOYLES. THESE ARE THE STATUES THAT WERE TAKEN. TAKE A LOOK. POLICE SAY THEY WERE STOLEN FROM A HOME ON THE 300 BLOCK OF LINCOLN WAY EAST BETWEEN 1130 AT NIGHT ON THURSDAY AND SEVEN IN THE MORNING FRIDAY. IF YOU KNOW WHERE THESE GARGOYLES MAY BE, OR WHO MAY HAVE TAKEN THEM, YOU’RE BEING ASKED TO CALL CHAMBERSBURG POLICE IN YORK COUNTY. POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO VANDALIZED A SPEEDWAY. NEWBURY TOWNSHIP POLICE AND THE BAPS MOTOR SPEEDWAY ARE ASKING FOR YOUR HELP IDENTIFYING THE VEHICLE AND PERSON RESPONSIBLE. IN THE VIDEO, YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE THE RED PICKUP TRUCK DRIVING ON THE GRASS. NOW THIS IS THE DAMAGE LEFT BEHIND. THE MOTOR SPEEDWAY SAYS IT COULD TAKE MONTHS TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. THE GENERAL MANAGER OF BAPS MOTOR SPEEDWAY SAYS THE DAMAGE WILL AFFECT THE EVENTS THEY HOST. THE TOUGH THING FOR US IS, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE EVENTS WEEKLY, SO, YOU KNOW, IT’S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A STRUGGLE WITH SOME OF THE GRASS DAMAGE, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE RUTS AND WHATNOT THAT, YOU KNOW, WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO PLANT GRASS WHILE WE’RE HOSTING EVENTS. SO IT’S JUST UNNECESSARY TIME AND EFFORT FOR SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY THOUGHT WAS WAS FUNNY. AND THERE IS A REWARD OF UP TO $2,000 FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO AN ARREST IN CUMBERLAND COUNTY.

						The Pennsylvania Department of Health is alerting Pennsylvanians that an individual from another state tested positive for measles while visiting Lancaster County after a trip to Texas, creating a potential for exposure to others.People may have been exposed to measles if they were in the following location at the date and time indicated:  WellSpan Ephrata Community Hospital Emergency Department169 Martin Ave., Ephrata, PA 17522Tuesday, April 8, 2025, between 9:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.WellSpan Health is contacting known individuals who visited this site during this time period. The risk to the general public is low due to high vaccination rates across Pennsylvania. People who are fully immunized are at very low risk of contracting the measles. People unsure of their vaccination status should contact their health care provider.The individual is an unvaccinated resident of another state visiting Lancaster County who became infected after traveling to Texas.“The best protection against measles is vaccination,” said Secretary of Health Dr. Debra Bogen. “With two MMR vaccines, residents are at low risk of getting and spreading the measles. Knowing the signs of sickness and places people may have been exposed will help protect individuals and communities from this disease.”Measles is a highly contagious illness that is spread when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus remains infectious in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after the infected person leaves the area.Symptoms begin with a fever, cough, runny nose and conjunctivitis, followed by a rash that starts on the face and spreads downward. Without proper protection or supportive care, measles can be deadly.People who believe they were exposed to measles and are experiencing symptoms should contact their health care provider or call the Pennsylvania Department of Health's toll-free hotline at 877-PA-HEALTH. All residents are encouraged to monitor for symptoms.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the people most at risk are: Infants younger than 1 who are too young to have received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccineIndividuals who are unvaccinatedIndividuals from parts of the world where there is low vaccination coverage or where there is circulating measles

              &lt;p&gt;A sacred pilgrimage ended up in the toilet for several travelers earlier this year. Health officials in Europe have reported an outbreak of superbug cholera traced back to tainted holy water sourced from Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials in Germany and the UK detailed the strange outbreak in a report &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.14.2500234"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal Eurosurveillance. At least seven people across both countries were sickened with a multidrug-resistant cholera strain that originated from the Bermel Georgis holy well in Ethiopia. Though several people were hospitalized and some even required intensive care, all of the victims thankfully survived.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/about/index.html"&gt;Cholera&lt;/a&gt; is caused by the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/em&gt;. Though many people infected by cholera bacteria don’t become sick, the infection can sometimes cause severe, even life-threatening diarrhea and vomiting. Improved sanitation has greatly reduced the threat of cholera over time, but it still sickens millions of people a year, and anywhere between 21,000 and 143,000 people die from it annually, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera"&gt;World Health Organization.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, there has been an &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/cholera-upsurge"&gt;upswing of cholera&lt;/a&gt; across the world, including in parts of Europe. While most cases in Europe are travel-associated (meaning the infection was caught in another country), there have been local outbreaks tied to food and water imported from cholera-stricken areas.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In Ethiopia, an ongoing outbreak of cholera has &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380693/OEW9-240202032025.pdf"&gt;sickened&lt;/a&gt; at least 58,381 people and killed over 700 since August 2022. This past February, a resurgence of cholera struck the Amhara region in Northern Ethiopia, home to the &lt;a href="https://bermelgiorgis-tsebel.vercel.app"&gt;Bermel Georgis holy well&lt;/a&gt;. The well—a popular travel site revered for its natural waters said to contain miraculous healing powers—was soon found to be &lt;a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-cholera-outbreak-dg-echo-un-ocha-who-echo-daily-flash-06-february-2025"&gt;contaminated with cholera&lt;/a&gt;, raising the risk of further spread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report authors, health officials in Germany first caught wind of the outbreak in late February. Three residents had developed cholera earlier that month, and all had been exposed to the waters of the Bermel Georgis. Two of the residents had brought home holy water stored in a plastic bottle during a trip to Bermel Georgis. When they arrived back home, the two travelers consumed the water and splashed it onto the face of the third person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials in the UK confirmed four similar cases around that time. Three of the residents recently traveled to the area and a fourth person reported drinking Bermel Georgis water brought home by the third person (a fifth person was also sick with cholera-like symptoms but recovered without being tested). The multidrug-resistant strains of cholera found in the UK patients bore a genetic close resemblance to strains previously found in Africa, further confirming the outbreak’s origin.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the cholera found in these people was still susceptible to at least one frontline antibiotic (standard cholera treatment is providing people fluids, though antibiotics are also used for more serious cases). Six of the seven people were hospitalized, with two needing intensive care at one point, but all eventually recovered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clusters of cholera extending into Europe from Ethiopia are unusual, according to the researchers, though holy water consumption has been identified as a possible risk factor for cholera in the African country. It’s likely that the water had to be heavily contaminated with bacteria for it to still be infectious after the long journey back to Europe. Despite the unusual nature of this outbreak, officials say there are practical steps that travelers can take to limit their risk of catching cholera.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Travelers eating food cultivated in areas where cholera is endemic should follow the ‘cook it, peel it, or forget it’ rule, ensure drinking water is bottled or boiled, and refrain from transporting food and/or water across borders,” they wrote. “In the case of holy water, purely external use would reduce gastrointestinal infection risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Even when they perform tasks well, they tend to focus on moments of low confidence and ignore times when they felt assured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This persistent underconfidence can discourage them from trying new challenges, despite being capable. However, the study also found that positive, external feedback can help recalibrate their self-perception and break the cycle of self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underconfidence Bias:&lt;/strong&gt; People with anxiety and depression focus on low-confidence moments, even after good performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metacognitive Distortion:&lt;/strong&gt; These individuals misjudge their overall ability due to incorrect self-assessment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power of Feedback:&lt;/strong&gt; External positive feedback helps them update their self-perception more accurately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagine you start a new job. You’re thrown into new tasks that require you to learn new skills. As you progress, you start to develop a sense that you’re good at your job – a sense of confidence in your performance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you’re one of those people who continues to doubt your own abilities even though you perform well time and time again. Maybe you’re even afraid that one day your boss or colleagues will start thinking that you are incapable of doing the things you need to do at work – the so-called imposter syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108690"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a person on a podium." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/anxiet-self-image-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;After each individual task, they had to report how confident they felt in their answer. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to reflect on ourselves and our capabilities is called metacognition. However, some people’s metacognitive processes lead to a distorted view of their own capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘People with anxiety and depression tend to exhibit persistent underconfidence, as we call it. Their skewed judgement of their own abilities can lead them to avoid new tasks, even when they can do them,’ explains Sucharit Katyal, postdoc at the Department of Psychology at the University of Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital fruits reveal trend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, Sucharit Katyal and colleagues from University College London have identified the psychological mechanisms underlying persistent underconfidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We recruited a large number of volunteers via a web-based platform and measured their symptoms of anxiety and depression. We then asked participants to complete a computer game where they had to help the residents of ‘Fruitville’ in harvesting fruit,’ explains Sucharit Katyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had to use both their visual and memory skills to complete the tasks. After each individual task, they had to report how confident they felt in their answer. Finally, they had to rate how well they felt they had completed the entire game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Here we discovered that participants with symptoms of anxiety and depression often ignored the times when they felt a high sense of confidence in their answers. Instead, they focused on situations where their answers were accompanied by low confidence when judging their overall performance,’ says Sucharit Katyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive feedback works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the study shows that people with anxiety and depression may satisfactorily perform tasks – but ultimately are not updating their self-perception correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘This points to the need for interventions that specifically address metacognitive distortions in people with anxiety and depression,’ says Sucharit Katyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also shows that people with persistent insecurity in their abilities can correctly update their self-perception when they are explicitly told that they have performed well – rather than them having to rely on their own confidence assessments in those abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘It is actually effective to have these persistently insecure people focus more on their successes and less on their internal insecurities,’ says Sucharit Katyal and elaborates:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘This emphasises the importance of positive feedback. Some people need help to take their own judgements with a grain of salt – otherwise they will just maintain a distorted, negative view of their own capabilities,’ he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this anxiety and self-perception research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#90e3fbf8f1d0f1f4fdbefbe5bef4fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Simon Knokgaard Halskov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ku.dk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Simon Knokgaard Halskov – University of Copenhagen&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57040-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distorted learning from local metacognition supports transdiagnostic underconfidence&lt;/a&gt;” by Sucharit Katyal et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distorted learning from local metacognition supports transdiagnostic underconfidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression have been shown to exhibit persistent underconfidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origin of such metacognitive biases presents a puzzle, given that individuals should be able to learn appropriate levels of confidence from observing their own performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two large general population samples (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 230 and &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 278), we measure both ‘local’ confidence in individual task instances and ‘global’ confidence as longer-run self-performance estimates while manipulating external feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global confidence is sensitive to both local confidence and feedback valence—more frequent positive (negative) feedback increases (respectively decreases) global confidence, with asymmetries in feedback also leading to shifts in affective self-beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, however, global confidence exhibits reduced sensitivity to instances of higher local confidence in individuals with greater subclinical anxious-depression symptomatology, despite sensitivity to feedback valence remaining intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our finding of blunted sensitivity to increases in local confidence offers a mechanistic basis for how persistent underconfidence is maintained in the face of intact performance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 13:59:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE5hWEU3c0ZFWlI4NHZIdGZtLVZZM2dMTThyZ1BhMk51MDNfTERYbWpRQVozbFFweUNRemNienhURVNZSWV0a2NwRDA3azViRDUyOFNRNzBJaEFmTVlwZHpBS0VSek5qS3VfV25R</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，这个简单的练习可以降低痴呆症的风险- Surrey Live | Dementia risk could be slashed by this simple exercise, study suggests - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPeHJwSTk5MGRXeGdIZ2ZkVkZhRHlYUHJDV1lKTkJKdzRCVFVHdnZ3ZC12WEl3OU1FYmVidk1rbFQxWkI2YUhqZHlsbzh3c1hWRVdBenJJZFJvck5DWlFUMEcybDA2S1JGU0lVRXdKYUViSDZjY0pvckRZdmNtZ0FodVFuZDl5YWUwNFZr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in a particular form of exercise could significantly reduce your risk of a progressive brain condition, according to recent research. A fresh study has identified a type of physical activity that can help in reducing the likelihood of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia is a syndrome characterised by a gradual deterioration of brain function, leading to symptoms such as memory loss and changes in behaviour. It is estimated that over 55 million individuals globally are living with dementia, and this number is expected to rise due to an ageing demographic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Although there is currently no cure for dementia, studies have indicated that certain lifestyle adjustments can mitigate the risk. Researchers have previously suggested that up to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/dementia-prevention-intervention-care" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;45 percent of dementia cases&lt;/a&gt; could be avoided through specific lifestyle modifications. The latest study has now highlighted one particular method to achieve this. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In conversation with &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/can-weight-training-protect-brain-dementia-cognitive-decline#Weight-training-helps-protect-certain-areas-of-the-brain" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;, Isadora Ribeiro, one of the researchers from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil, explained: "Since there is still no cure (for dementia), finding ways to delay or prevent its onset - especially through accessible, non-pharmacological strategies - is essential to improve quality of life in ageing." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-024-01483-8" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;GeroScience&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that weight training could serve as a protective measure for the brains of the elderly against dementia, including for those who are already experiencing mild cognitive impairment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study involved 44 adults aged 55 or older diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, who were divided into two groups. One group undertook a resistance exercise programme with moderate to high-intensity sessions twice weekly, increasing weights or sets as their strength improved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The control group did not exercise throughout the study. Ribeiro continued: "We chose to study resistance training because its primary goal is to increase muscle strength, which is especially important in older adults. Research has shown that greater muscle strength is associated with a lower risk of dementia and better cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Therefore, investigating the impact of resistance training on the brain anatomy of older adults at risk for dementia is a promising and relevant approach." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After six months, those in the weight training group demonstrated improvements in verbal episodic memory - the ability to recall or recognise words, sentences, or narratives - and the strength of neurons and areas of the brain linked with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conversely, the control group showed signs of deteriorating brain parameters. Ribeiro noted: "This is an interesting finding because it suggests that weight training may not only help to increase cognition, but also prevent the development of atrophy in regions related to Alzheimer's disease - potentially delaying progression or even preventing the onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The fact that we observed changes in white matter integrity indicates that resistance training may directly affect the anatomical structure of neurons, which is essential for efficient communication between brain regions, supporting memory, attention, and overall cognitive function."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adding to the positive findings, the study revealed that following the trial, a number of people in the weightlifting group no longer met the criteria for mild cognitive impairment by the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This suggests that weight training may alter the clinical trajectory of individuals with mild cognitive impairment, shifting them from an increased risk of dementia to preserved cognition by the end of the study," she said. "Even in a small sample, the fact that several participants showed improved cognitive health after the intervention is a hopeful indication of the potential protective effects of this type of exercise."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A previous report earlier this year, detailed in the &lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Directors Association&lt;/a&gt;, already suggested a connection between physical activity and a lower dementia risk. The study indicated that even a minimal amount of moderate to vigorous exercise, around 35 minutes per week, was linked to a sweeping 41 per cent decrease in the chance of developing dementia when compared to not exercising at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study's lead author, Amal Wanigatunga, stated: "Our findings suggest that increasing physical activity, even as little as five minutes per day, can reduce dementia risk in older adults. This adds to a growing body of evidence that some exercise is better than nothing, especially with regard to an ageing-related disorder that affects the brain that currently has no cure."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exercising from home&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/strength-exercises/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; recommends some strength training exercises can be easily done at home.

A fresh study has identified a type of physical activity that can help in reducing the likelihood of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia is a syndrome characterised by a gradual deterioration of brain function, leading to symptoms such as memory loss and changes in behaviour. It is estimated that over 55 million individuals globally are living with dementia, and this number is expected to rise due to an ageing demographic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Although there is currently no cure for dementia, studies have indicated that certain lifestyle adjustments can mitigate the risk.

"It turns out he’s been watching a couple have sex through their bedroom window!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pseudonymed as "Jackson," the husband in question suggested when confronted by his unsuspecting spouse that it was all in good fun and there was "&lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/voyeur" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;no harm&lt;/a&gt;" in his voyeurism from their high-rise apartment — and even propositioned that his spouse join him in his nightly observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I asked how he would feel if he found out someone was watching us, he responded with 'flattered,'" the writer, nicknamed "The Bodies He’s Observing Aren’t Celestial Ones," recounted. "Jackson then suggested we take turns 'watching the show.' I called him a pervert and left the room."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If "Bodies" is to be believed — and there's a non-zero chance that this letter, or any other, &lt;a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/media/dear-prudie-it-was-me-all-along" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;is fibbed&lt;/a&gt; — it's clear that they're at wits' end. After asking Juzwiak what the best course of action would be, short of calling the cops, to "put a stop to [Jackson's] voyeurism," the advice columnist also seemed perplexed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know you’re not coming to How to Do It for legal advice, right?" Juzwiak responded. "That said, voyeurism/peeping Tom laws vary by state, so while it's possible that what Jackson is doing is illegal, it's not certain. If you are curious about the law in your location, you’ll have to perform your own search."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;Futurism&lt;/em&gt; found via our own search that this nefarious telescopic use case is more common than we'd like to admit.

The findings hint at a deeper integration between our internal rhythms and visual perception, potentially influencing how we experience the world with each breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Response Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Pupil size changes in rhythm with breathing, expanding during exhalation and contracting at inhalation onset.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universally Robust Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; The pattern held true across lighting, breathing methods, and cognitive tasks in over 200 participants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Diagnostic Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruptions in this response may signal neurological conditions, similar to how light reflexes are used in medicine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have probably heard the saying that the eyes are the windows to the soul, but now it turns out that they are also connected to how we breathe. Scientists have long studied the size of our pupils to understand attention, emotion and even medical conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, new research has surprisingly revealed that they change size in sync with our breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108686"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/pupil-size-breathing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This discovery changes the way we think about both breathing and vision. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our pupils are never static; they constantly adjust in response to both external and internal factors. The most well known is that they control how much light enters the eye, just like a camera aperture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can easily test this yourself: look into a mirror and shine a light into your eye, and you’ll see your pupils shrink. This process directly affects our visual perception. Larger pupils help us to detect faint objects, particularly in our peripheral vision, while smaller pupils enhance sharpness, improving tasks like reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this reflex is so reliable that doctors use it to assess brain function. If a pupil fails to react to light, it could signal a medical emergency such as a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is not just light that our pupils respond to. It’s also well established that our pupils constrict when focusing on a nearby object, and dilate in response to cognitive effort or emotional arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the German pupil-research pioneer Irene Loewenfeld once said: “Man may either blush or turn pale when emotionally agitated, but his pupils always dilate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, pupil size is often used in psychology and neuroscience research as a measure of mental effort and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The fourth response&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many decades, &lt;a href="https://journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;these three kinds of pupil response&lt;/a&gt; were the only ones that scientists were sure existed. Now, myself and our team of researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands have confirmed that breathing is a fourth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what will now be known as “pupillary respiratory phase response”, pupils tend to be largest during exhalation and smallest around the start of inhalation. Unlike other pupil responses, this one originates exclusively in the body and of course happens constantly. Equally uniquely, it covers both dilation and constriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had in fact been anecdotal hints of a connection between breathing and our pupils for more than 50 years. But when the team reviewed past studies &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-022-02729-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the evidence was inconclusive at best&lt;/a&gt;. Given how widely pupil size is used in both medicine and research, we realised it was crucial to investigate this further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We confirmed through a series of five experiments with more than 200 participants that pupil size fluctuates in sync with breathing, and also that this effect is remarkably robust. In these studies, we invited the participants to our lab and recorded their pupil size and breathing pattern while they were relaxing or performing tasks on a computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We systematically varied the other key pupil-response factors throughout the study – lighting, fixation distance and mental effort required for tasks. In all cases, the way that breathing affects the pupils remained constant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we examined how different breathing patterns affected the response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were instructed to breathe solely through their nose or mouth and to adjust their breathing rate, as well as slowing it down and speeding it up. In all cases, the same pattern emerged: pupil size remained smallest around the onset of inhalation and largest during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery changes the way we think about both breathing and vision. It suggests a deeper connection between breathing and the nervous system than we previously realised. The next big question is whether these subtle changes in pupil size affect how we see the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fluctuations are only fractions of a millimetre, which is less than the pupil response to light, but similar to the pupil response to mental effort or arousal. The size of these fluctuations is theoretically large enough to influence our visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may therefore be that our vision subtly shifts within a single breath between optimising for detecting faint objects (with larger pupils) and distinguishing fine details (with smaller pupils).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, just as the pupillary light response is used as a diagnostic tool, changes in the link between pupil size and breathing could be an early sign of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is part of a broader effort to understand how our internal bodily rhythms influence perception. Scientists are increasingly finding that our brain doesn’t process external information in isolation – it integrates signals from within our bodies, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, information from our heart and gastric rhythms have also been suggested to enhance or hinder the processing of incoming sensory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If our breathing affects how our pupils change, could it also shape how we perceive the world around us? This opens the door to new research on how bodily rhythms shape perception – one breath at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/martin-schaefer-2317877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Martin Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Martin Schaefer – The Conversation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1113/JP287205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The pupillary respiratory-phase response: pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation&lt;/a&gt;” by Martin Schaefer et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pupillary respiratory-phase response: pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respiration shapes brain activity and synchronizes sensory and exploratory motor actions, with some evidence suggesting that it also affects pupil size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, evidence for a coupling between respiration and pupil size remains scarce and inconclusive, hindered by small sample sizes and limited controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of pupil size in visual perception and as a reflection of brain state, understanding its relationship with respiration is essential. In five experiments using a pre-registered protocol, we systematically investigated how respiratory phase affects pupil size across different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;50), we examined nasal and oral breathing at rest under dim lighting with nearby fixation points, then replicated these results under identical conditions in Experiment 2 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;53).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment 3 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;112) extended this to active visual tasks, while Experiment 4 (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 57) extended this to controlled breathing at different paces under ambient lighting with distant fixation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in Experiment 5 (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 34), individuals with isolated congenital anosmia (born without olfactory bulbs) were used as a lesion-type model during visual–auditory tasks to assess whether the respiratory–pupil link depends on olfactory bulb-driven oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 13:35:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTFBtam11c1I2TkltQlVkLTd0Wk02Q3RVVXFXV0JiYlJNLTNDc1lONklFaTFRT05GNi14bEE4WTBOdllKYkszdDliUzYzaHRVS1BkTEhTZHU5WlFwajZuUjdzR2tRakFTbXM</guid></item><item><title>研究人员发现的新的深海洋捕食者 - 玻璃年鉴 | New Deep-Ocean Predator Discovered by Researchers - Glass Almanac</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxOSHBUOC1OcFBGYmtYQUdlaVZQRWM1QVZZekQwMmVxMjY3cjNjVzlUWTRfd0w1TFctb0NDYklURF9scUxFSXBuanFzMFlicHVWamhJSGpjNXRPMWxsVVdsdlQ3dkJrb1FQTTR4T21GbGhhbkUzdXhmV2hweDNScnZtbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;
			&lt;p class="" data-start="53" data-end="553"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the uncharted depths of our planet, researchers have uncovered an extraordinary new predator that calls the abyssal zones of the ocean home. This new discovery not only highlights the strange and often unsettling life forms lurking in the deepest parts of the ocean but also sheds light on the importance of exploring these hidden ecosystems. Welcome to the world of Dulcibella camanchaca, a relentless hunter that thrives in total darkness nearly 8 kilometers beneath the ocean’s surface.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="53" data-end="553"&gt;&lt;span id="more-5576"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="555" data-end="617"&gt;Meet Dulcibella camanchaca: A Relentless Hunter in the Dark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="619" data-end="1110"&gt;Imagine descending into the pitch-black depths of the ocean, where sunlight cannot penetrate. At nearly &lt;strong data-start="723" data-end="744"&gt;8 kilometers deep&lt;/strong&gt;, off the coast of &lt;strong data-start="763" data-end="781"&gt;Chile and Peru&lt;/strong&gt;, scientists stumbled upon an unexpected creature: a small, shrimp-like animal measuring only &lt;strong data-start="875" data-end="892"&gt;4 centimeters&lt;/strong&gt;. While it may seem unremarkable at first glance, Dulcibella camanchaca is anything but ordinary. Despite its diminutive size, this creature is an effective predator in the extreme conditions of the &lt;strong data-start="1091" data-end="1109"&gt;Atacama Trench&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="1112" data-end="1594"&gt;What sets Dulcibella camanchaca apart is its ability to hunt other &lt;strong data-start="1179" data-end="1192"&gt;amphipods&lt;/strong&gt;—its primary prey—using specialized &lt;strong data-start="1228" data-end="1253"&gt;prehensile appendages&lt;/strong&gt; to snatch them from the water in total darkness. Its agility and speed in the absence of light make it an expert hunter. As &lt;strong data-start="1378" data-end="1396"&gt;Johanna Weston&lt;/strong&gt;, co-director of the study from &lt;strong data-start="1428" data-end="1468"&gt;Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution&lt;/strong&gt;, explains, “We named it after the word for ‘darkness’ in Andean languages to reflect the shadowy environment where it hunts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="1596" data-end="1649"&gt;A Groundbreaking Discovery: New Species, New Genus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1651" data-end="2096"&gt;The discovery of Dulcibella camanchaca was made during the 2023 &lt;strong data-start="1715" data-end="1735"&gt;IDOOS expedition&lt;/strong&gt; (Integrated Deep-Ocean Observing System). Scientists from the &lt;strong data-start="1798" data-end="1835"&gt;Instituto Milenio de Oceanografía&lt;/strong&gt; in Chile captured four specimens, providing an opportunity for &lt;strong data-start="1899" data-end="1946"&gt;detailed morphological and genetic analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. Their findings were nothing short of revolutionary: this tiny creature is not just a new species, but it also belongs to a completely new &lt;strong data-start="2086" data-end="2095"&gt;genus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2098" data-end="2589"&gt;To put this into perspective, when scientists identify a new genus, it signals the discovery of an entirely new branch of life. In biological terms, a &lt;strong data-start="2249" data-end="2260"&gt;species&lt;/strong&gt; is a group of organisms that share common traits and can reproduce together. A &lt;strong data-start="2340" data-end="2349"&gt;genus&lt;/strong&gt; is a broader classification that can encompass multiple species. By recognizing a new genus, researchers have unveiled a previously hidden part of the ocean’s biodiversity, one that exists in the most extreme and remote parts of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/what-would-happen-if-you-dug-a-hole-through-the-earth/"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="2591" data-end="2628"&gt;The Need for Continued Exploration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2630" data-end="3086"&gt;Dulcibella camanchaca’s discovery underscores how much more there is to learn about life in the &lt;strong data-start="2726" data-end="2741"&gt;hadal zones&lt;/strong&gt;—the ocean’s deepest, least explored regions. These zones, often thought to be barren and lifeless, are in fact teeming with unique forms of life. As &lt;strong data-start="2891" data-end="2912"&gt;Carolina González&lt;/strong&gt;, co-director of the expedition, highlights, “The hadal zones are rich in unique biodiversity, and we are only beginning to understand the extent of life that thrives there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3088" data-end="3578"&gt;These deep-ocean ecosystems, which remain largely untouched by human activity, are incredibly vulnerable. As we continue to explore and learn more about these &lt;strong data-start="3247" data-end="3270"&gt;unexplored habitats&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s crucial to protect them from human-induced disturbances, such as deep-sea mining and pollution. The discovery of &lt;strong data-start="3390" data-end="3415"&gt;Dulcibella camanchaca&lt;/strong&gt; is not just a curiosity for scientists; it’s a reminder of the importance of safeguarding the hidden, diverse life forms that persist in these harsh environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="3580" data-end="3620"&gt;The Deep Ocean: Earth’s Last Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3622" data-end="4027"&gt;The &lt;strong data-start="3626" data-end="3641"&gt;hadal zones&lt;/strong&gt; remain one of the final frontiers of exploration on Earth. With each new discovery, like that of &lt;strong data-start="3739" data-end="3764"&gt;Dulcibella camanchaca&lt;/strong&gt;, we are reminded that our knowledge of the ocean’s deepest corners is still incredibly limited. As advancements in exploration technology continue, more species and ecosystems will likely be revealed, further challenging our understanding of life on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4029" data-end="4298"&gt;Each new discovery opens up fresh questions. How can life thrive in such extreme conditions? What other unknown creatures lie beneath the surface, waiting to be discovered? The abyssal depths hold many secrets, and researchers are only beginning to scratch the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="4300" data-end="4487"&gt;As we continue to uncover the mysteries of the deep ocean, one thing is certain: the Earth’s last frontier is far from fully explored, and the surprises it holds are bound to keep coming.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study reveals subtle yet significant changes in stress biomarkers, including cortisol levels, heart rate, blood pressure, and inflammatory interleukins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While survivors report resilience and low PTSD or depression scores, their physiological responses show heightened alertness and immune system changes. These findings underscore the lasting physical impact of trauma, even when emotional recovery appears complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Residue of Trauma:&lt;/strong&gt; Survivors had lower cortisol, higher blood pressure, and altered heart rate—indicating lasting stress system changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory Markers:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated interleukin 1B and reduced interleukin 2R suggest ongoing immune system imbalance in trauma survivors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disconnect Between Mind and Body:&lt;/strong&gt; Psychological symptoms did not correlate with the altered biological stress responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Oklahoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent research from the University of Oklahoma suggests that survivors of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing carry physiological traces of the trauma, even though study participants have gone on to lead healthy and resilient lives. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, their bodies “remember” the trauma even if they don’t have physical or mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108682"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/trauma-body-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Survivors had higher blood pressure but a lower heart rate in response to trauma cues, suggesting their response may have become blunted over time. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have examined biological stress and psychological symptoms in terrorism survivors, but the recently published research is thought to be the first of its kind to study three different biological systems in medically healthy people who survived the same traumatic event: cortisol, which plays a crucial role in the body’s stress response; heart rate and blood pressure; and interleukins, which are inflammatory substances that play a role in the body’s immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research participants included 60 heavily impacted direct survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing, compared to a control group of local people who were not affected by the bombing. People in both groups were healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that, counterintuitively, cortisol levels were lower in people who survived the bombing. Survivors had higher blood pressure but a lower heart rate in response to trauma cues, suggesting their response may have become blunted over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two interleukins were measured. Interleukin 1B, which is linked with inflammation, was significantly higher in survivors, and interleukin 2R, which plays a protective role, was lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway from the study is that the mind may be resilient and be able to put things behind it, but the body doesn’t forget. It may remain on alert, waiting for the next thing to happen,” said Phebe Tucker, M.D., lead author of the study and professor emeritus of psychiatry at the OU College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thought there would be a correlation between these biomarkers and the research participants’ psychological symptoms, but their PTSD and depression scores were not elevated and did not correlate with stress biomarkers,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That tells us there is a stress response in the body that is not present in the emotions they express. In addition, the elevated interleukin 1B is typically seen in people with illnesses and inflammation, but this group was pretty healthy. However, it raises concerns about potential long-term health problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tucker and her colleagues have regularly conducted studies involving bombing survivors beginning soon after the event occurred. In this new paper, they are using data obtained seven years after the bombing. At the time, they did not study the same biomarkers, making this new study unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Basically, what this paper shows is that after you’ve experienced severe trauma, your biological systems may not be at a typical baseline any longer; things have changed,” said study co-author Rachel Zettl, M.D., clinical assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, OU College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just our minds that remember trauma; our biological processes do, too. It changes your actual physical being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors of this paper were Betty Pfefferbaum, M.D., professor emeritus in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, OU College of Medicine; Carol North, M.D., adjunct professor, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; Yan Daniel Zhao, Ph.D., professor, OU Hudson College of Public Health; Pascal Nitiema, Ph.D., Arizona State University; and Haekyung Jeon-Slaughter, Ph.D., University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this PTSD and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#41203133282d6c2b6c36282d2a2433322e2f012e342932226f242534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;April Wilkerson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ouhsc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;April Wilkerson – University of Oklahoma&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1049023X24000360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Learning from Hindsight: Examining Autonomic, Inflammatory, and Endocrine Stress Biomarkers and Mental Health in Healthy Terrorism Survivors Many Years Later&lt;/a&gt;” by Phebe Tucker et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prehospital and Disaster Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning from Hindsight: Examining Autonomic, Inflammatory, and Endocrine Stress Biomarkers and Mental Health in Healthy Terrorism Survivors Many Years Later&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unprecedented retrospective study explores long-term stress biomarkers in three systems in terrorism survivors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty healthy, direct terrorism survivors were compared to non-exposed community members for cardiovascular reactivity to a trauma script, morning salivary cortisol, interleukin 1-β (IL-1β), and interleukin 2-R (IL-2R).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survivors’ biomarkers were correlated with psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses and reported functioning and well-being seven years after the Oklahoma City (OKC) bombing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main outcome measures were the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) Disaster Supplement for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnoses, Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Distress and Functioning Scale (DAF), and General Physical Well-Being Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survivors had higher inflammatory IL-1β, lower anti-inflammatory IL-2R, lower cortisol, higher resting diastolic blood pressure (BP), and less cardiovascular reactivity to a trauma script than comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survivors’ mean posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptom levels did not differ from comparisons, but survivors reported worse well-being. None of survivors’ biomarkers correlated with PTS or depressive symptoms or diagnoses or reported functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alterations of biological stress measures in cardiovascular, inflammatory, and cortisol systems coexisted as an apparent generalized long-term response to terrorism rather than related to specific gauges of mental health. Potential interactions of biomarkers long after trauma exposure is discussed considering relevant research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer-term follow-up could determine whether biomarkers continue to differ or correlate with subjective measures, or if they accompany health problems over time. Given recent international terrorism, understanding long-term sequelae among direct survivors is increasingly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 12:57:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBMM25BYzBsVXlqM05wSUJyUGxhM3ptc29QallmNFFIczJ4c0FyLWJiSGlyTmdCNjhaTmFCTXZpcUxvbHZMbHBvRDJmdjhyelBSWDRDQkxCSFpiamV5Vlo1VEhxOTlUc0xiQTFVLQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
