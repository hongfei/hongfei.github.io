&lt;h2&gt;Key Facts&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services &lt;a href="https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" aria-label="reported"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its outbreak had grown to 198 cases of measles as of Friday, with 23 of the patients having been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas health department said just five of the cases are in vaccinated people, with the remainder of the sick patients being unvaccinated (80) or having an unknown vaccination status (113).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the New Mexico Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" aria-label="said"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; a deceased man in Lea County who was unvaccinated against measles tested positive for the virus, though they said he did not seek medical care before passing and “the official cause of death is still under investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lea County, New Mexico, is home to all 30 of the state’s confirmed measles cases, and is about 47 miles from Gaines County, Texas, where the majority of Texas’ measles cases have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where In Texas Is The Measles Outbreak?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 137 of the measles cases are located in Gaines County, a rural area about an hour-and-a-half west of Lubbock. The remaining cases are in Terry County (29), Dawson County (9), Yoakum County (8), Dallam County (5), Martin County (3), Lubbock County (3), Ector County (2) and Lynn County (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Age Groups Is The Measles Outbreak Impacting In Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty-nine of the cases have been among people aged five to 17, while 64 cases were among children between the ages of zero and four and 34 were reported among adults over age 18. The ages of 11 patients have not been stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/fbs-ad&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Are There Outbreaks In Other States?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is an outbreak in New Mexico, where &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" aria-label="30 cases"&gt;30 cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in Lea County, which is on the border with Texas. Outside of Texas and New Mexico, anywhere from one to nine cases have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="reported by the CDC"&gt;reported by the CDC&lt;/a&gt; in California, Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, Florida, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Are Measles Symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a fever, rash, cough, fatigue, runny nose and red eyes. The symptoms do not appear until 10 to 14 days after someone is exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Contagious Is Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can spread from one person to nine out of 10 people close to them, according to the CDC, which notes a person infected with measles can spread it to others four days before through four days after the rash appears. Measles can spread through coughing, sneezing and infected surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Measles Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." aria-label="highly effective and safe"&gt;highly effective and safe&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which has been available for over half a century, is about 97% effective at preventing measles with the standard two doses and 93% effective with one dose. The vaccine is typically given to people when they are children, with one dose administered between 12 to 15 months and another administered between four to six years old. The vaccine generally provides long-term or lifelong protection. There is no problem with getting the vaccine if you are an adult unsure of their vaccination status, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" aria-label="NPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. Adults born after 1957 and vaccinated before 1968 should consider getting revaccinated, NPR reported, noting early measles vaccines are not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Has Rfk Jr. Said About The Measles Outbreak And Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After claiming the outbreak is “not unusual,” Kennedy changed his stance and considered it “serious,” saying in a March 3 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" aria-label="statement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; “the measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health.” Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" aria-label="vaccine skeptic"&gt;vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, said vaccines contribute to community immunity, but did not explicitly tell people to get vaccinated and noted the “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.” He also supported the use of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician to treat people with mild, moderate, and severe infection, creating concerns among health experts who have cautioned about the vitamin’s effectiveness. Sue Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" aria-label="The Washington Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that solely relying on vitamin A instead of the MMR vaccine is “dangerous and ineffective” and can put children at risk, noting too much vitamin A can “cause serious health problems, including liver damage.” Meanwhile, advocacy non-profit Children’s Health Defense, which was founded and once chaired by RFK Jr., has attacked the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" aria-label="quoted skeptics"&gt;quoted skeptics&lt;/a&gt; who claimed measles was “an insignificant inconvenience until we turned it into a literal neurological damage nightmare through the MMR vaccine campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Crucial Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities,” according to The Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas measles outbreak began in late January with just two cases and has become the state’s largest outbreak of the virus in 30 years. The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" aria-label="report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of student immunization status for the 2023-2024 school year that 5.64% of Texas kindergarten students were not vaccinated for measles, while 2.34% of seventh graders had not received the vaccine. Measles was fully eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the virus was not spreading within the country and new cases only came from people who contracted measles abroad and returned to the U.S. In 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported across 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;SEMINOLE, Texas – Last Saturday, Zach Holbrooks walked into a mobile measles screening and vaccine clinic he had helped set up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the executive director of the &lt;a href="https://southplainshealth.org/" target="_blank"&gt;South Plains Public Health District&lt;/a&gt;, which includes Gaines County, he dropped by to check on how many shots the crew had given out so far that day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Has it been busy today?" Holbrooks asked the two staffers in what's normally a livestock show barn on the outskirts of downtown Seminole. "Not so far. We've only given one," they replied.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks works and lives in this town, the county seat, which in the last few weeks became the epicenter of the largest measles outbreak in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, March 4, one 6-year-old unvaccinated child had died of the measles. There are now &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;159 confirmed cases and 22 hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt;, but local health authorities say the true total is likely much higher.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says outbreaks tend to occur when the vaccination rate&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html__;!!Iwwt!WOht7WM-b65xhcncf6ZyqjlBqbKTRaIxWB-NlqKDVH0JWldhrMa3FkN8ikXMnavEP7uPA4dFvFvxPawOGro$" target="_blank"&gt; in a community dips below 95%&lt;/a&gt;. The kindergarten vaccination rate for measles, mumps and rubella on record in Gaines County sits at 82%, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank"&gt;state health records&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many children there are homeschooled or attend private primary school, so those rates could be even lower.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks has been busy since the outbreak started in late January. He's been setting up mobile testing and vaccination sites; he said this remote part of West Texas has a large immigrant population, many whose immunization records are unknown, so he's been circulating flyers with measles information in different languages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have a mix of people out here, a large German speaking population, Spanish speaking population," which he said makes getting residents the right information about disease control even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Authorities still don't know how the measles got to Seminole, but John Belcher, the town's former mayor, said he understands why it's spreading beyond the city limits.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Folks who live out here basically have to drive everywhere, he said. They hop in the car or truck and drive miles to get groceries, go to doctor's appointments, attend church and to get to work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'd say within 200 miles, maybe even farther, if there's a metal building out there, it came from products manufactured in Gaines County," Belcher said. "And the building was probably put together by companies from Gaines County."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People here need to drive about 80 miles to catch a flight at the Lubbock Airport.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others travel often to nearby communities in Lea County, on the New Mexico side of the state line. That state has &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/__;!!Iwwt!WOht7WM-b65xhcncf6ZyqjlBqbKTRaIxWB-NlqKDVH0JWldhrMa3FkN8ikXMnavEP7uPA4dFvFvxrvRiLIE$" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 10 confirmed measles cases. On Thursday, New Mexico Health officials confirmed that an unvaccinated adult testing positive for the virus has died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-52432" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A sense of normalcy&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Seminole, the outbreak has mainly infected children since early January.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Local authorities say the Mennonite community has been hit hard by measles, though they don't have an exact number of confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Grub Shack, a restaurant owned and run by a Mennonite family, seems to be running at full steam. Other businesses in downtown Seminole and people just carry on with their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many Mennonites immigrated here in the late 1970s. There remain thousands of Mennonites in Seminole some 50 years later.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tina Siemens' father moved his family here from northern Mexico in 1976 when she was 8. She was raised Mennonite and manages the &lt;a href="https://wtlhm.com/" target="_blank"&gt;West Texas Living Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which tells the history of this part of West Texas' Native American and Mennonite heritage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While many Mennonites are not against vaccines in principle, Siemens said, some seek other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The Mennonites are very keen on home remedies," Siemens said. "So there may be a family that, nobody knows that they might have all had the measles."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The state's health officials have said there's plenty of vaccine for everyone who needs it, and Holbrooks said he doesn't think it's a lack of access to the vaccine that's spreading measles out here.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At last count, 214 people in Gaines County have been vaccinated for measles since the outbreak. Holbrooks believes that number is not higher because some people fear debunked ideas about its safety.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I just think there's some vaccine hesitancy, even more so since COVID," Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-50709" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the measles vaccine is safe and two doses prevent infection, not just severe illness, 97% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Julie Carter has lived in Seminole all her life. Her three kids are adults: 19, 22 and 30 years old. They got the measles vaccine before starting elementary school, but she became a vaccine skeptic when she started researching ways to improve her health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was overweight; I wasn't feeling good," Carter said. "I kind of went on a journey where I got educated. I came across the vaccine thing and wasn't sure how healthy those were."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health officials say doubts about vaccines continue to hamper vaccination efforts. Plus, this illness has not been a major public health issue. In 2000, the CDC declared the virus eliminated from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks said that for a lot of younger parents, measles is a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not something that people thought a lot about," he said. But he's urging those in the community to do just that because the consequences can be severe. "If it was just a simple rash, a rash won't lead to brain inflammation, intellectual disability, death, pneumonia, deafness, convulsions."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And measles, one of the most contagious known viruses, can spread for days without a person feeling sick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Two people have now died in the growing measles outbreak in west Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New Mexico Health officials on Thursday confirmed the death of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination" target="_blank"&gt;The first death was a school-age child&lt;/a&gt; in Gaines County, Texas last week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;News of a second death comes as infectious disease doctors worry that the federal government's messaging about the outbreak is putting more emphasis on treatments like vitamin A than on vaccination, even as misinformation about some of these treatments is spreading online.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those concerns come in the wake of recent comments made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy addressed the growing measles outbreak in an editorial for FOX News published on Sunday, also &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html#:~:text=Measles%20is%20a%20highly%20contagious,breathes%2C%20coughs%2C%20or%20sneezes" target="_blank"&gt;posted on the HHS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While mentioning the value of vaccination for community immunity, Kennedy said "the decision to vaccinate is a personal one." He emphasized treatment for measles, saying that vitamin A can "dramatically" reduce deaths from the disease. In an&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369595673112" target="_blank"&gt; interview with FOX News&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, he said Texas doctors are giving steroids and cod liver oil to their measles patients and "getting very, very, good results."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In his editorial, he said good nutrition is "a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That emphasis on nutrition and vitamin A to treat measles is concerning some infectious disease doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Mentions of cod liver oil and vitamins [are] just distracting people away from what the single message should be, which is to increase the vaccination rate, " said&lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/amesh-adalja-md-fidsa" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Amesh Adalja, &lt;/a&gt;an infectious disease physician and senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While vitamin A can play a role in preventing severe disease, discussion of vitamins, "doesn't replace the fact that measles is a preventable disease. And really, the way to deal with a measles outbreak is to vaccinate people against measles," says&lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1972558187/adam-j-ratner" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Adam Ratner, &lt;/a&gt;a member of the infectious disease committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy did acknowledge that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;measles is highly contagious &lt;/a&gt;and that it poses health risks, especially to people who are not vaccinated. He said vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also protect people who can't be vaccinated. But he didn't strongly encourage people to get their children vaccinated — which is usually a key part of the public health response during an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In 2019, when a measles outbreak was raging in the U.S., then health secretary Alex Azar &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/24/716953746/cdc-reports-largest-u-s-measles-outbreak-since-year-2000" target="_blank"&gt;came out with a statement&lt;/a&gt; strongly supporting vaccination and warning of the risks of under-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to vitamin A, studies conducted decades ago in low and middle-income countries found that the vitamin can reduce the risk of severe disease and death, in children who are malnourished and have vitamin deficiencies, says Adalja.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;There's also evidence that, even in the absence of a pre-existing deficiency, measles seems to deplete the body's stores of vitamin A. Both&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/" target="_blank"&gt; the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend giving two doses of vitamin A to children who have the disease, especially if they are so sick they are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, Ratner stresses that vitamin A does not &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A false idea circulating online is that giving children high doses over long periods of time can prevent measles, says Ratner. He says that's not only wrong but can be quite dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Vitamin A can accumulate in the body," he says. "It can be toxic to the liver. It can have effects that you don't want for your child," like liver damage, fatigue, hair loss and headaches. Ratner works as a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City. He says that similar misinformation about vitamin A made the rounds during the city's measles outbreak in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scott Weaver, &lt;a href="https://microbiology.utmb.edu/faculty/scott-weaver-phd" target="_blank"&gt;director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas Medical Branch, says he worries people might look at a vitamin bottle and think, "Well, maybe if I take two or three times this amount, I'll be even better protected against measles.&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm concerned that people think that vitamin A or other nutrition is a substitute for vaccination to prevent infection and to prevent spread," Weaver says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In his Fox News interview, Kennedy said Texas doctors are "getting very, very, good results." with a mix of treatments including steroids and cod liver oil. NPR has not confirmed the use of cod liver oil in Texas, but Adalja says, "there's no data that cod liver oil is going to have any benefit on measles."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And because cod liver oil is so high in vitamin A, Ratner worries parents could end up giving their children too much – potentially toxic amounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adalja would have liked Kennedy to emphasize that&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" target="_blank"&gt; vaccines are the best defense against measles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Then you don't even have to think about treatment, because when it comes to an infectious disease, prevention is always better than treatment," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Very happy, silly and funny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A memorial service is set for 11 a.m. Friday at the Transfiguration of Christ Church in Corona, Queens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Glen Oaks native&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret Elenis was born and raised in Glen Oaks, the middle of three children to Antonios Elenis, 62, and Elisabeth Elenis, 61, who together operated a family-owned plumbing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating from Francis Lewis High School in Fresh Meadows, Margaret Elenis attended Baruch College for two years, where she played on the school's basketball team, before transferring to Queens College, earning a bachelor's degree in special education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She would go on to teach special education, and later become a dean, at William Cullen Bryant High School in Astoria for seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, she married Vasili Siklas, and together they had two sons, Konstantino, 9, and Alexandro, 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Elenis Siklas was 28, nearly three years after the birth of Konstantino, she was diagnosed with stage-two breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a year later, after changing her lifestyle — eating healthier and taking a high dosage of vitamins — the cancer went into remission without any chemotherapy or radiation, her sister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly thereafter, Elenis Siklas began to notice she could no longer take Konstantino to their favorite indoor play area because the food there didn't fit into her now-healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, she and her sister opened "Oh My Goodness Kids," in Garden City, which she described to Newsday in 2023 as a "sanctuary where everything is healthy for kids ... a safe space here we could promote a better lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pregnancy complications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elenis Siklas became pregnant for a second time in 2020 but the cancer quickly returned in a much more aggressive form, creating major complications, family members said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors delivered Alexandro at 30 weeks "because I wasn’t going to make it," spending a month going back and forth from the treatment center to the NICU, Elenis Siklas told Newsday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of Alexandro's birth, Elenis Siklas had already been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, her sister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even while continuing to battle cancer, Elenis Siklas was determined to grow the business, opening a second location in Port Washington and expanding to include drop-off programs, as well as cooking and yoga for older children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, there’s a negative to getting cancer, but this is my opportunity," she told Newsday at the time. "I chose to pursue a path where I know I’m doing something for the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Thinking of others&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last April, even as her health continued to deteriorate, Elenis Siklas established &lt;a href="https://ball4lifegives.com/"&gt;Ball4Life&lt;/a&gt;, a basketball fundraiser for women and mothers battling breast cancer. The group's second annual event is scheduled for next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was a force. She had an unbreakable spirit and never took no for an answer," said Irene Candela, 38, of Port Washington, Elenis Siklas' cousin. "A lot of people always talk about what they want to do or what they wish would happen. But she made anything happen that she wanted to happen ... She never wanted help or to accept anything from anyone. She wanted to help everyone else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As news spread on social media of Elenis Siklas' passing this week, a flood of friends and customers took to Oh My Goodness Kids' Instagram page to share stories and describe her as an "inspiration" and a "warrior" who constantly lifted the community's spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with her husband, two children, sister and parents, Elenis Siklas is survived by a brother, Emmanuel Elenis, 37, of Malverne, and several in-laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lieu of flowers, the family asked that donations be made to Ball4life, located at 25-18 50th Street in Woodside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Robert Brodsky" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=96&amp;amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                                    &lt;span class="half-and-half__title h5"&gt;Cop16 deal hailed a ‘step forward’ for nature protection&lt;/span&gt;
                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wealthy nations have agreed to mobilise at least $200bn (£155bn) per year by 2030 to help developing countries conserve biodiversity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The commitment was hammered out in Rome, Italy, at the resumed Cop16 talks, which broke down in Colombia last November. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Agreed by the 196 states that signed up to the Convention on Biological Diversity (including Russia, but excluding the US), the deal was hailed a win for multilateralism in uncertain times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Negotiators from all countries … put their differences aside to forge a common path forward,” said Lin Li, senior director for global policy at WWF International. “What’s left now is an urgent need to mobilise funding … to ensure we reach the $200bn a year committed by 2030.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An Lambrechts, head of Greenpeace’s Cop16 delegation, agreed. “It is now crucial that global north countries honour their commitments and translate today’s decisions into real funding to protect biodiversity.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the progress, many countries wanted to see greater ambition to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 – a target that looks likely to be missed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

About 20 years ago, I had prostate cancer and went through 43 weeks of radiation. My PSA level in the past year has risen slightly from .03 ng/mL to .09 ng/mL. My internist has suggested that I get a PET scan. Do you think this is necessary?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— H.L.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear H.L.:&lt;/strong&gt; When the PSA level rises after radiation treatment for prostate cancer, there could be some prostate cancer cells that survived the treatment and are growing. The usual threshold to be concerned about is 0.2 ng/mL, which you would be expected to get to in about one to three years if your PSA keeps rising. (It may not.) This situation is often called a "biochemical recurrence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If the PSA level is rising quickly, or you had a very aggressive tumor (determined by pathology called the Gleason score; your internist or urologist should know this information), this would be more worrisome. On the other hand, since your PSA level is still quite low, and it has been 20 years, the risk of prostate cancer getting big enough to bother you during your lifetime is small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I certainly recommend that you go back and see your urologist, who probably has more experience than an internist like me. Some urologists do get PET scans in this situation once the PSA is above 0.2 ng/mL, but I am not sure that you need it. Much depends on your PSA level when it's next checked in 6-12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; My otherwise-healthy 65-year-old wife takes large amounts of vitamins and supplements a day. Her doctor says this is fine, but it looks to be a lot more than a dozen. Do large amounts of vitamins and supplements actually have a beneficial effect? I know vitamins are necessary, but to this extent? Could large amounts be detrimental?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— S.W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear S.W.:&lt;/strong&gt; Many studies have been designed to determine whether supplemental vitamins and minerals lead to a benefit in healthy people. As a group, they have consistently failed to show any benefit in the quality or length of life, so I do not recommend vitamin or mineral supplementation for healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Some people prefer to treat symptoms with dietary supplements, and there are a few supplements that may be effective. But it sounds like your wife is taking hers just to be healthier, and I don't think they are effective at doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It is unusual to get serious side effects from vitamins and minerals unless the doses are far above what is recommended. Still, she's probably wasting money on these supplements. Most of my patients I tell this to are reluctant to stop, as they have often been taking them for many years. Or they're convinced that the supplements are helpful, and it can be hard to change people's minds with new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I got the two doses of the shingles vaccine. Is this enough? Do I need the chickenpox one, too? I do not remember if I got chickenpox when I was young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— S.R.E.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear S.R.E.:&lt;/strong&gt; Two doses are all you need for the Shingrix vaccine, which is the vaccine given to people who have either had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine. This includes more than 95% of people over the age of 50, whom the shingles vaccine is designed for. It is not recommended to get the chickenpox vaccine or even test for immunity before getting the shingles vaccine.&lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Detroit News</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 05:07:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNZm5vT1FqeXBaOEwtX1NRV2Yxc2ZyOXdvME1nN1BtblVoOThwRnBZWEVEUzFTVjhfTFdSazhmV3N3a2RYZXdpbnZxMVhjVXBMYkYtX3ljWjhaTjBSbEtGQVcwVzRIWkNucEhJa21FclhPLWstRUdwd0lQalVaLTg2cC0wbGNUQ09ncWliUUZ2bXFjdlQ2LWNVT3BMbl9VWXVqd3BLYXRST3VKQnR6ZHVYNGhvNGpDM08ycmtPZHhad0pnckNwYUNsU2xkTzhUS2hld3NNUg</guid></item><item><title>Losing Just One Night's Sleep Changes Your Immune System, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNNVk4TXJNeWR1MFdmeV9Ha1JHTjJqX1ZZWmtZdDRRd3E2WWczNGxSdlg5Vjl0ZExHQjNyUk40cGxScDhDOFdFbTJnTHhXTnY3aU4yelFST0JCUnI4U1ZnbWwtcUZ0UXQtVmFXSUFRdkVCU09URENfRHA4ZExidUh1VVo5dEVrN2lTUDBpUUFIcHN4NE9kX0lhTnZJNEw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We all know sleep is important, but it takes up so much time. With responsibilities and diversions still looming from our waking life, the urge to skimp on sleep can be powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet as a new study suggests, even a single night of sleep deprivation may cause significant upheaval in the immune system, potentially contributing to the development of conditions like obesity,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="153478" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns"&gt;perils of chronic sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; are widely known, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-a-lack-of-sleep-can-mess-with-your-emotions"&gt;mood changes&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive impairments to health problems like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/six-to-eight-hours-sleep-best-for-heart-cardiovascular-health"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is abundant evidence linking &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-an-important-reason-disturbed-sleep-makes-everything-hurt-more"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; with these and other ailments, and abundant evidence suggesting health problems like these are commonly driven by chronic inflammation, the authors of the new study point out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is less evidence, however, about the specific mechanisms involved: How exactly could sleep deprivation lead to the systemic inflammation that goes on to impair people's health?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers from the Dasman Diabetes Institute in Kuwait sought to understand the influence of sleep deprivation on circulating immune cells, such as monocytes, and its association with systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monocytes are large leukocytes, or white blood cells, that play key roles in the innate immune system, which provides the body's first line of defense against intruders. There are three subsets of monocytes in humans: classical, non-classical, and intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-classical monocytes patrol for pathogens in vasculature and extravascular tissues, the study's authors explain, using inflammatory cues to help them regulate the body's immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 276 healthy Kuwaiti adults with varying body mass indices (BMIs), 237 of whom ended up completing the study. They analyzed the subjects' sleep patterns, and monitored their blood for levels of different monocyte subsets as well as inflammation markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obese participants had significantly lower sleep quality than leaner participants, the study found, along with higher chronic low-grade inflammation. They also had more non-classical monocytes, which correlated with lower sleep quality and increased pro-inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another part of the study, five healthy, lean adults submitted blood samples throughout a 24-hour period of sleep deprivation. These were compared to control blood samples taken after the participants had had a few days of refreshing sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even just 24 hours of sleep deprivation apparently altered the monocyte profiles in lean participants to resemble those of obese participants, a condition the researchers note is known to promote chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153551" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer.jpg" alt="person working late at computer" class="size-full wp-image-153551" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer-600x361.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153551" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tillwe/2634026113/"&gt;Till Westermayer/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer may seem obvious – just get more sleep – but it's rarely that simple in real life. Modern civilization conspires to keep us up late, argues lead author Fatema Al-Rashed, a researcher at the Dasman Diabetes Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings underscore a growing public health challenge. Advancements in technology, prolonged screen time, and shifting societal norms are increasingly disruptive to regular sleeping hours," Al-Rashed &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This disruption in sleep has profound implications for immune health and overall well-being."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research should continue this examination of the links between sleep deprivation and immune changes, Al-Rashed and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkae016"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also hope to learn if any interventions might help mitigate this effect, such as structured sleep therapies or guidelines for limiting use of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the long term, we aim for this research to drive policies and strategies that recognize the critical role of sleep in public health," Al-Rashed &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We envision workplace reforms and educational campaigns promoting better sleep practices, particularly for populations at risk of sleep disruption due to technological and occupational demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, this could help mitigate the burden of inflammatory diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases," she &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkae016"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A 3D-printed penis implant has restored erectile function to rabbits and pigs in a world first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigs with damage to their penile tissue that received the one-of-a-kind surgery not only achieved erections, their rates of successfully producing offspring increased from 25 percent to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penis has one of the most complex vascular network structures in the human body. For years now, researchers have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590183424000127"&gt;working on a model&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_cavernosum_penis"&gt;corpus cavernosum&lt;/a&gt;, the spongy tissue of the penile shaft, that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reverse-erectile-dysfunction-in-pigs-using-synthetic-tissue"&gt;could help those with erectile defects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent study by a team from China, the US, and Japan presents a new physiological model that can reproduce erections in large, living animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the model, researchers mimicked the corpus cavernosum through the creation of a hydrogel-based scaffolding – one that is strong enough to withstand the internal pressure when the structure fills with blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154200" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-642x231.png" alt="Biomimetic Penis" class="size-medium wp-image-154200" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-642x231.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-768x277.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-600x216.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis.png 1294w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154200" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Images of the full biomimetic penis model with a (i) front view (ii), side view (iii), and partial section view.

Endothelial cells (ECs) can create an "&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10066672/"&gt;adaptable life-support system&lt;/a&gt;" in vessel-rich tissues, helping restore and improve function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea out in the corpus cavernosum of Bama pigs and New Zealand rabbits, researchers implanted the hydrogel and ECs into dozens of animals with erectile defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some rabbits and pigs received the artificial penis implant &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; ECs, but those that received the ECs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the implant showed better erectile function overall. In fact, their outcomes approached that of an animal without erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings indicate that the implants markedly improved functional recovery, and the combination with ECs further enhanced this effect, demonstrating notable improvements in tissue regeneration and functional recovery," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors, led by biological engineer Zhenxing Wang from South China University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fertility of the EC groups demonstrates the recovery of erectile function and the ability to ejaculate, suggesting the restoration of the cavernous tissue in the treated males."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154212" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-642x311.png" alt="3D Printed Penis Repair" class="size-medium wp-image-154212" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-642x311.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-856x415.png 856w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-768x373.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-600x291.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects.png 1336w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154212" class="wp-caption-text"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="154179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; images of 4 different rabbit groups: defect, implantation, ECs + implantation, and normal cavernosum (normal).

&lt;p&gt;When the pigs were allowed to breed a few weeks after surgery, pregnancy rates rose from just 25 percent in the defect group to 75 percent in the implant without ECs group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male pigs that received the implant with ECs successfully impregnated every single female pig they mated with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154214" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-642x155.png" alt="3D Printed Penis Pigs" class="size-medium wp-image-154214" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-642x155.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-1024x247.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-768x185.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-1536x370.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-600x145.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis.png 1992w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154214" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Schematic diagram of the procedure for implanting the model into a defect made on the pig corpus cavernosum.

&lt;p&gt;It could also help inform the development of other artificial, vessel-rich organs, like the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Currently, developing transplant materials that support nerve regeneration and effectively integrate with the host's urethra and vascular networks presents a major challenge," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These findings underscore the potential clinical applications of biomimetic corpus cavernosum for the treatment of penile injuries," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; Wang and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, this study advances the clinical application of 3D-printed artificial tissue organs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Maybe dogs who chew sticks are on to something. We don't necessarily have to chomp with a canine's zeal, but the basic concept – safely gnawing some hard, durable material – might be worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, chewing on a hard substance like wood can boost levels of a naturally occurring antioxidant in the human brain, which in turn might improve a person's memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people chew gum, of course, which is softer but arguably more palatable than wood (and avoids tongue splinters). Previous research has shown chewing gum can, in fact, significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010209000893?via%3Dihub"&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154405910308200817"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt;, as the authors of the new study note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the brain's blood supply pumping seems to improve a variety of cognitive functions, it seems. Curiously, clinical evidence also suggests people who find chewing a challenge also tend to have lower cognitive function and higher mental impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear, though, what specific metabolic changes associated with cognition might occur following a boost in cerebral blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers investigated one possible explanation involving oxidative stress in neurological tissues, which is already believed to play a pivotal role in the decline of cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several metabolic processes produce harmful molecules known as reactive oxygen species, which can cause cumulative oxidative damage in the human brain. One of the brain's best defenses against oxidative stress is an antioxidant called glutathione (GSH), which holds many important jobs throughout the body, including protecting neurons from reactive oxygen species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to shed light on the cognitive effects of chewing, the researchers designed the new study to explore the potential role of glutathione. Despite its importance in the brain, they note, the relationship between glutathione levels and mastication has drawn little attention until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recruited 52 healthy university students from Daegu, South Korea, and divided them into two groups. One group of 27 subjects was given paraffin wax gum to chew; a second group of 25 was asked to chew on wooden medical tongue depressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154198" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick.jpg" alt="dog chewing on a stick" class="size-full wp-image-154198" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick-600x370.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154198" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maybe dogs are onto something. (&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/39908901@N06/6995110133/"&gt;m01229/Flickr/CC BY 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects chewed their assigned substance for five minutes, while researchers used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure glutathione levels in their anterior cingulate cortex – a key brain region for cognitive control – before and after chewing. All subjects also took a cognitive test before and after the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chewing significantly boosted glutathione levels in subjects' anterior cingulate cortices, especially in the wood-chewing group compared with the gum-chewing group, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with results from the cognitive tests, the rise in glutathione concentration correlated positively with memory function. In other words, those who chewed wood and had larger glutathione boosts also performed better on the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that mastication can alter the level of antioxidants in the human brain, and that an increase in brain antioxidant levels is associated with cognitive function," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research will still be needed to back up these findings, the study's authors add, with larger sample sizes, broader demographics, and assessment of different brain regions important focusses for subsequent studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While wood seemed to confer more benefit than paraffin wax gum, this study also only tested two substances being chewed for five minutes. Future research might also investigate a wider range of materials and chewing durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings alone may not be sufficient evidence to recommend chewing wood for better memory, but they do provide a compelling hint. And it would be good news if chewing wood does have this effect, the researchers write, given the challenge of managing glutathione levels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since there are currently no drugs or established practices for boosting brain GSH levels, our findings suggest that chewing moderately hard material could serve as an effective practice for increasing GSH levels in the brain," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919/full"&gt;Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Ainslee Sirten said that it started a little less than two weeks ago, near the end of February, when her mom, Dri Marquez, texted her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She texted me on Sunday and said that everybody was really sick," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That included Marquez's partner of almost 10 years, Danny Moore. The next day, Sirten said that they called her a little after 1 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She said that Danny just fell unconscious, and they had to call paramedics and start CPR on him," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that paramedics couldn't resuscitate him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was nothing they could do; his kidneys failed, and that's a complication of the flu, we guess," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sirten said that Moore was just 38 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were no terribly awful health conditions that he had for him to pass of kidney failure or complications of the flu. So, [that was] unbelievable to me," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She spoke about Moore's impact on her mom and her 8-year-old brother Finn, who is Moore's son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He fit right in when he started dating mom. That was so awesome for her to have someone who she just clicked with," said Sirten. "He was hilarious. He was such a good dad to Finn. They were best buddies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Moore passed away, both Marquez and Finn also ended up in the hospital with the flu. Sirten said that her brother is back home, but her mom is still fighting for her life. She said that her mom received a liver transplant almost three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She is immunocompromised, and they said that as far as sickness goes, it didn't help her case at all. She developed pneumonia in the hospital," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors said that hospitals are still pretty full as flu activity remains very high throughout the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some times in individuals, and they may not even have extra medical comorbidities, where the flu triggers a really serious illness," said Dr. Stephen Feagins, Hamilton County Public Health Medical Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Sirten, she is thankful for the support of others during this tough time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're just trying to keep our family unit close, make sure that we have people we can turn to," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sirten said that her mom is on a ventilator and receiving dialysis at UC Medical Center as she continues to recover.

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmkc5p002s26pbchgj8qis@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas this week to aid in the response to a growing measles outbreak, and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xnamtm00063b6m9x7fx8p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpgsgd000h3b6m7s8ho1z1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrbh2400062e6cnep5jf09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000a2e6cuqb0f8ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000b2e6cfvwktkme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000c2e6cwtm9usqp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv0hws00002e6cx76souke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv6nxi000s2e6cndkfdev4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at200062e6cjuti606p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board  found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their  care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300072e6ctwybg8wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for  inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and  “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in  the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300092e6c4h391al9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the  medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of  steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.

            The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;board’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;final order  stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients  appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was  providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources  and medical support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in  2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing  additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the  medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he  would modify his practice accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000c2e6cbkua19ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" target="_blank"&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" target="_blank"&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xxumb600003b6meeeztgx7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2du600023b6mah5eqk5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000g2e6cdoeuhaz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2i4p00053b6mvl4sgoua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000h2e6cd4znip1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000i2e6c4kz9lcrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000j2e6c8ma0gqso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000k2e6cf2lnc7m1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000l2e6cyj7hmk6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s]  another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false  sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get  this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the  outbreak is growing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000m2e6c01cn4ikw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are  healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t  really discriminate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000n2e6cxdatyv4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies  that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say  it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000o2e6c50a1zuff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000p2e6cz16qiott@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000q2e6cdkrxspm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrkcx0000d2e6cnrxpdjll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ws9jcj000n2e6ccultebiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv17ix00042e6cqg913c2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xq4rz4000p3b6mk9vcw5lb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsa9zw000q2e6c8va8tapm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsdabj000t2e6cq7dibsk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsipec000w2e6c4m87d1et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wt8uxe001l2e6chmq0bgzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wtd1ix001o2e6cyvn2vi1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others echoed that sentiment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000o2e6clzemqalo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xc1zua00092e6cun50djvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7xo2fls000d3b6mx8s93shb@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="understanding-infectious-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Understanding infectious disease
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00112e6cim844a5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xna7ln00033b6mbmoemelp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhdzsc00003b6mqw0v4gj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00122e6cqpn7eb1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00132e6cwogzdy8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00142e6chlzyxdn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00152e6c8v2k4kp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001c2e6c2mf4jx73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001e2e6cz4g2ul1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001f2e6c96gesrp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xj0yyx00002e6cb0654evm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpimxw000k3b6mrnzjws7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpi87f00032e6ctsf3lox5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpx3e8000b2e6czy5syvtf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xprk1t00062e6c1xq1cx39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas this week to aid in the response to a growing measles outbreak, and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xnamtm00063b6m9x7fx8p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpgsgd000h3b6m7s8ho1z1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrbh2400062e6cnep5jf09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000a2e6cuqb0f8ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000b2e6cfvwktkme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000c2e6cwtm9usqp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv0hws00002e6cx76souke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv6nxi000s2e6cndkfdev4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at200062e6cjuti606p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board  found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their  care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300072e6ctwybg8wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for  inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and  “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in  the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300092e6c4h391al9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the  medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of  steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000a2e6cdxrbzlls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;board’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;final order  stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients  appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was  providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources  and medical support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000b2e6cl4ok9kif@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in  2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing  additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the  medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he  would modify his practice accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000c2e6cbkua19ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" target="_blank"&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" target="_blank"&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xxumb600003b6meeeztgx7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2du600023b6mah5eqk5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000g2e6cdoeuhaz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2i4p00053b6mvl4sgoua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000h2e6cd4znip1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000i2e6c4kz9lcrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000j2e6c8ma0gqso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000k2e6cf2lnc7m1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000l2e6cyj7hmk6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s]  another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false  sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get  this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the  outbreak is growing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000m2e6c01cn4ikw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are  healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t  really discriminate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000n2e6cxdatyv4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies  that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say  it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000o2e6c50a1zuff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000p2e6cz16qiott@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000q2e6cdkrxspm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrkcx0000d2e6cnrxpdjll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ws9jcj000n2e6ccultebiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv17ix00042e6cqg913c2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xq4rz4000p3b6mk9vcw5lb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsa9zw000q2e6c8va8tapm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsdabj000t2e6cq7dibsk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsipec000w2e6c4m87d1et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wt8uxe001l2e6chmq0bgzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wtd1ix001o2e6cyvn2vi1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others echoed that sentiment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000o2e6clzemqalo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xc1zua00092e6cun50djvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7xo2fls000d3b6mx8s93shb@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="understanding-infectious-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Understanding infectious disease
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00112e6cim844a5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xna7ln00033b6mbmoemelp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhdzsc00003b6mqw0v4gj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00122e6cqpn7eb1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00132e6cwogzdy8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00142e6chlzyxdn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00152e6c8v2k4kp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001c2e6c2mf4jx73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001e2e6cz4g2ul1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.

            “If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The experiment involved mice born to live fast and die young, bred with a rodent version of progeria, a condition that causes premature aging. Left alone, the animals grow gray and frail and then die about seven months later, compared with a lifespan of about two years for typical lab mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OELJRTUCDZEH7ASSNEXANH5MGI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the Salk scientists had a plan to change the aging animals’ fate. They injected them with a virus carrying four genes that can reshape DNA and, in effect, make every cell in the rodents’ bodies young again. The scientists could even control the genes from outside the mice, turning them on and off to manage the safety and potency of the genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DIBJOPWA5RHOZOFC234Y2ISHAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The experiment worked: The animals lived 30 percent longer afterward, a marked improvement, if not quite a normal mouse lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="57RMNYHIJ5BTFC4LHW4WHUR52U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Read &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/06/cellular-reprogramming-longevity-reverse-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;more here&lt;/a&gt; about how cellular reprogramming works and whether it can improve human health spans and lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="26SE3TNP5ZBCXNS2P3IL4Z4QSI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="26SE3TNP5ZBCXNS2P3IL4Z4QSI"&gt;Paxlovid may not reduce hospitalization risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GSUDONFGGFAFTMNMV33YCVEUEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re an older adult between the ages of 65 and 74, you may want to read our story about the antiviral medication for covid, Paxlovid.

You have heard of cholesterol, and you may even know what your cholesterol level is. The compound lipoprotein a may be equally dangerous when it is elevated, but you have probably heard very little about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could listen through your local public radio station or get the live stream at 7 am EDT on your computer or smart phone (&lt;a href="https://www.wunc.org"&gt;wunc.org&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/find-a-radio-station"&gt;Here is a link&lt;/a&gt; so you can find which stations carry our broadcast. If you can’t listen to the broadcast, you may wish to hear the podcast later. You can subscribe through your favorite podcast provider, download the mp3 using the link at the bottom of the page, or listen to the stream on this post starting on March 10, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is Lp(a)?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipoprotein a, or L-P-little a for short, circulates in the bloodstream, where it picks up and carries cholesterol and oxidized phospholipids. Scientists believe that blood levels are determined mostly by genetics and change very little over the course of our lives. Roughly 20 percent of people have high levels of Lp(a), above 30 ng/dL or 75 nmol/L. The two different figures are because tests use different units to measure the blood concentration, either nanograms per deciliter or nanomols per liter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we don’t know if Lp(a) has or perhaps once had some important functions, we do know that elevated levels of this chemical is associated with heart disease. People with higher levels are more likely to suffer blood clots and inflammation. That puts them at risk for heart attacks or even strokes. So why hasn’t your doctor ordered a blood test to learn your level?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is Lp(a) the Heart Risk Doctors Can’t Treat?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps doctors have been reluctant to measure or discuss lipoprotein a because they don’t have good interventions. That is beginning to change with the development of antisense oligonucleotides, a new category of prescription drugs that can cut levels sharply. The FDA has not yet approved any of these new medications, though. The first of these, pelacarsen, is still in Phase 3 trials needed before the agency can consider the evidence. However, it can bring down lipoprotein a by an estimated 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists’ favorite drugs, statins, do not help Lp(a) levels. In fact, Lp(a) the heart risk rises when people are taking statins to lower their cholesterol. Other cholesterol-lowering drugs such as evolocumab (&lt;strong&gt;Repatha&lt;/strong&gt;) and alirocumab (&lt;strong&gt;Praluent&lt;/strong&gt;) can bring Lp(a) levels down modestly. One really old cholesterol-lowering drug, high-dose niacin, also helps moderate Lp(a). Some people do not tolerate it, however, as it can cause very uncomfortable flushing. So far as we know, no scientists have run studies to see whether niacin reduces the risk of heart attacks and other complications because of its effects on Lp(a).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Other Complications of Lp(a):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our guest, Dr. Sam Tsimikas, is among the country’s leading experts on lipoprotein a. We asked him whether Lp(a) the heart risk factor causes other problems as well. Dr. Tsimikas described heart failure, potentially resulting from a heart attack, as well as peripheral artery disease (PAD), which can make it painful to walk. Lp(a) seems to cause plaque in arteries throughout the body. As a result, it can increase the chance of a stroke. In addition, it contributes to calcification of the heart valves. This condition interferes with their ability to function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Can We Do If Lp(a) Is Too High?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tsimikas runs a unique clinic for cardiology patients with high levels of Lp(a). We asked him how he helps them. One approach is to collect additional information about their level of risk. A coronary calcium score can be a useful indicator. If it is high, he and his patients work to control all the potential risk factors that they can. He discusses the potential benefit of aspirin with them. Because Lp(a) the heart risk factor increases the chance of dangerous blood clots, the anti-clotting activity of aspirin can sometimes be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering dietary advice can be tricky if a patient has high cholesterol as well as elevated Lp(a), since the ideal diets for each are nearly opposite each other. A ketogenic diet tends to raise LDL cholesterol, for example, while it may modestly lower Lp(a). We think by the end of this episode, you’ll join us in hoping that scientists can learn a lot more about Lp(a) in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;This Week’s Guest:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sotirios (Sam) Tsimikas, MD, FACC, FAHA, FSCAI, is Professor of Medicine/Cardiology and Director of Vascular Medicine at the Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center.

Last year, 14 people in New York City were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;diagnosed with the illness&lt;/a&gt;, with an additional case elsewhere in New York State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But an unfolding outbreak of the disease in West Texas and New Mexico has cast a spotlight on measles, which is highly contagious and can prove deadly and is sometimes heralded by a rash. That outbreak has emerged at the same time that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;advocates unconventional treatments&lt;/a&gt;, has become President Trump’s secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;With measles so much in the news, residents of New York and New Jersey might be feeling concerned. Here’s what to know about the cases in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-1d3d1d2b"&gt;Should I be concerned about the local cases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Neither of the two patients in New York State, both of whom live in New York City, had been vaccinated against measles — one was an infant and too young to be immunized — and the cases are not related, according to the city’s health department. The first case was reported in January, and the second in February. Both patients have recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In New Jersey, all three people with confirmed cases of measles this year were not vaccinated against the virus. A person from Bergen County who had traveled internationally was the first of the three patients to be diagnosed, on Feb. 14, according to the state’s health department. Two people who had been in close contact with the first patient were diagnosed nearly a week later and were quarantined to minimize the chances of spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Seven were unvaccinated. The vaccination status of the other three people is unknown. Six of the cases were in adults and the rest were in children younger than 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;On Tuesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that they were sending a team to Texas to help local public health officials respond to the outbreak, which began in late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles – one of the most infectious diseases in the world – is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children aged 12-15 months, and the second for those aged four to six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We don’t want to see New Mexicans getting sick or dying from measles,” said Dr Chad Smelser, the deputy state epidemiologist. “The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is the best protection against this serious disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The crisis in Texas comes as the US Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Human Services (HHS) transitions under the leadership of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a well-known vaccine skeptic. Kennedy has long promoted the discredited theory linking childhood vaccinations to autism. One of his first actions in office was to postpone a public meeting on immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy raised alarm among pediatricians, vaccine experts and lawmakers after publishing an opinion piece that&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/rfk-jr-vitamins-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; focused on vitamin A and nutrition&lt;/a&gt; as treatments for measles and did not endorse vaccines. In response to the Texas measles outbreak, Kennedy wrote for Fox News about the benefits of “good nutrition” and vitamin A, but did not explicitly recommend highly effective vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the CDC, measles is fatal for one to two out of every 1,000 infected children.

But a side effect of this clotting factor is that it triggers a protein called ARHGEF1 — and that protein can suppress the cancer-fighting immune cells known as T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of someone taking aspirin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/alarming-rise-in-breast-cancer-rates-in-women-under-40-11683574" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Researchers Find an 'Alarming' Rise in Breast Cancer Rates in Women Under 40, Especially in These 5 States;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Researchers Find an 'Alarming' Rise in Breast Cancer Rates in Women Under 40, Especially in These 5 States &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By stopping the clotting factor, you stop the protein that stops the T-cells — a discovery that the study’s first author, Dr. Jie Yang, Department of Pathology at the University of Cambridge, called “a Eureka moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before this, we had not been aware of the implication of our findings in understanding the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin," Yang said.

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;The piece of advice comes from Dr Brandon Luu, an Internal Medicine Resident at the University of Toronto. He wrote: "Heating food in plastic containers — especially in the microwave — can release substantial amounts of microplastics and nanoplastics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Avoiding plastic food storage and using glass or stainless steel alternatives is a small but meaningful step in limiting exposure. While these changes make sense, we still need research to confirm whether lowering intake leads to reduced accumulation in human tissues."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31144326" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another recommended change is switching from bottled to filtered tap water. This habit could reduce the intake of microplastics from 90,000 to 4,000 particles a year, according to the article.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Bottled water alone can expose people to nearly as many microplastic particles annually as all ingested and inhaled sources combined," said Dr Luu. "Switching to tap water could reduce this exposure by almost 90%, making it one of the simplest ways to cut down on microplastic intake."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other significant sources include plastic tea bags, which can release millions of micro and nano-sized particles per brewing session. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31144351" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The dramatic increase in brain microplastic concentrations over just eight years, from 2016 to 2024, is particularly alarming," noted Dr Nicholas Fabiano from the University of Ottawa's Department of Psychiatry, lead author of the commentary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This rise mirrors the exponential increase we're seeing in environmental microplastic levels."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some particles are so small their size allows them to potentially cross the blood-brain barrier, raising questions about their role in conditions affecting the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research team also explored potential ways to remove plastic in the body, including evidence that sweating might help remove certain plastic-derived compounds from the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr David Puder, host of the Psychiatry &amp;amp; Psychotherapy Podcast, warned: "We need more research to wrap our heads around microplastics — rather than wrapping our brains in them — since this could be one of the biggest environmental storms most people never saw coming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 00:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxONkFzakNBNU9qWWxGYTd6Y2syMUZoczFWSTl6SFl3ekJ4VHROeUY3c09UN29qMGRDTUJid2cxc3YzYzI3LWpvUk91Uk9COHFmOXo4WGRhMjFKMG5VbGlPeTRhRjhlclg4WnNILUt4ZkhaeDAwQ2t0OW8zMGJIbHpnZlRzQWt1NVNyZTZMTk5ZWjY</guid></item><item><title>Patients with long Covid regain sense of smell and taste with pioneering surgery - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxQZnBvQ0FPa3BtTjBvOGw2bl9Wc1ZzS0U2YkdYckYyaXVDbW9HdWpCdFdnODVoZ0NFY3ZBZUhQUnJiZ1Q5dDZIYmU3MzU4Qy0weTFBUll0a29sMXEwY1lvVGRpTzhsLXAycHRTQ1ZUWE9xSk14bHJBVm1hZGRvREdNVFgyODIwSlY3UDhEMWVnVWJ3SWcza1FJb0Z5VWRYMTZod3JsMjJjaE5adGdyNkt6TkJjTndxVVhkV0tidHRtZ1ByU1dMbVc0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Doctors in London have successfully restored a sense of smell and taste in patients who lost it due to long Covid with pioneering surgery that expands their nasal airways to kickstart their recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Most patients diagnosed with Covid-19 recover fully.

All had experienced the problem for more than two years and other treatments, such as smell training and corticosteroids, had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In a study aiming to find new ways to resolve the issue, surgeons tried a technique called functional septorhinoplasty (fSRP), which is typically used to correct any deviation of the nasal septum, increasing the size of nasal passageways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This boosts airflow into the olfactory region, at the roof of the nasal cavity, which controls smell. Doctors said the surgery enabled an increased amount of odorants – chemical compounds that have a smell – to reach the roof of the nose, where sense of smell is located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They believe that increasing the delivery of odorants to this area “kickstarts” smell recovery in patients who have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/dec/24/do-me-a-flavour-adjusting-to-life-without-a-sense-of-smell-after-covid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;lost their sense of smell to long Covid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Peter Andrews, a senior consultant surgeon in rhinology and facial plastic surgery who led the research, said surgery increased the airway by about 30%, so airflow also increased by about 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This study has shown impressive results – if we apply the principle of increasing the nasal or olfactory airway, we’re getting a reactivation of the sense of smell and then an improvement of the sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“With long Covid anosmia you’ve got patients, fundamentally, who can’t smell or smell very poorly, so we need to somehow wake them up. And this operation sort of does that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It sort of wakes up the olfactory mucosa and then it builds on it through the increased nasal airway – hitting that area, more odorants hitting that area – and we’re getting this impressive recovery in the majority of the patients. All patients we operated on improved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the trial, 12 patients had fSRP and a control group of 13 patients continued with smell training – sniffing the same scents repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All patients who had fSRP reported an improved sense of smell compared with none of the patients in the sniff test group, where 40% actually reported a worsening sense of smell. The results were published in the journal Facial Plastic Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One of the patients, Penelope Newman, 27, from south London, said her taste and smell had “almost returned to normal” after the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Before I had the surgery on my nose, I had begun to accept that I would probably never be able to smell or taste things the way I used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Since the surgery, I have begun to enjoy food and smells the same way I used to. I can now cook and eat garlic and onions and people can cook for me too. I can go out to eat with my friends and family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQZnBvQ0FPa3BtTjBvOGw2bl9Wc1ZzS0U2YkdYckYyaXVDbW9HdWpCdFdnODVoZ0NFY3ZBZUhQUnJiZ1Q5dDZIYmU3MzU4Qy0weTFBUll0a29sMXEwY1lvVGRpTzhsLXAycHRTQ1ZUWE9xSk14bHJBVm1hZGRvREdNVFgyODIwSlY3UDhEMWVnVWJ3SWcza1FJb0Z5VWRYMTZod3JsMjJjaE5adGdyNkt6TkJjTndxVVhkV0tidHRtZ1ByU1dMbVc0</guid></item><item><title>Cedar: Woman being evicted from supported living home, say parents - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE02SlF0cVpLVllhSlNEZU9OSjM4WUdKT3Nta3cxekdXSVdGWlQxT2I4UnB0NVNyOWx1X0o4c1hpM0JxcXBDUW1xSUdVYi1MMW82eG5ack9va0ppUdIBX0FVX3lxTE1HV1FPOVlNSWlTaVFEdDBzTWdTckp6aWhzWkg1Z09CUGkzTE91TTUzXzNRRGh3NTFQMlpHVDJzSHEza2NFY05OYzdHd0wwb1ZXeWs4NF9XbkRqSm1YTFdz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Woman being 'evicted' from supported living home - parents&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Lyndsey Telford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News NI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC A man and a woman are standing next to each other outside a house.

class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There have also been ongoing issues, they said, regarding their request to bring in a private occupational therapist to assist their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr and Mrs Sharp said in response to their concerns, they were accused of being "abusive" to staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In January, they received a letter from Cedar giving eight weeks' notice of its decision to end her care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr and Mrs Sharp described this as an "eviction".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Continuous contact'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the letter, Cedar said it would work closely with the Belfast Trust to "minimise disruption" to Ms Sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The main reason for the decision, it said, was that it was "unable to provide the care and support that Laura needs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It added that relationships had "broken down" between Mr and Mrs Sharp and Cedar staff, citing "ongoing incidents of verbal aggression, disparaging comments, and intimidation towards staff".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It also said there had been "continuous contact" from the parents with visits, emails, and phone calls which had "led to unrealistic demands and pressures put on the staff and the service".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr and Mrs Sharp acknowledged that they may have been in contact too much – but that they were worried for their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They said they had never been abusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block"

class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A disability charity told BBC News NI it had worked with "hundreds of families" in which relationships with providers have "broken down" - and in some cases become "hostile".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Nuala Toman, head of disability and innovation at Disability Action, said: "Across the board, what we see is when a disabled person and a family raise a challenge then the system challenges back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;BBC News NI has spoken to another family with a loved one in a different home in a separate trust, who said they, too, felt they were being punished for making complaints about care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Sharp said: "When you raise concerns, they call that abuse. It's not abuse. We've never been abusive, just questioning them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I have never raised my voice up there, ever, in the seven years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mrs Sharp added: "If we weren't here, they wouldn't be evicting Laura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's us they really want rid of. And for them to put her out of there, because of concerns we've raised, it's just baffling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While the Cedar Foundation said it could not comment on individual cases it said it was "committed to work in partnership with individuals, families, and health trusts to do [its] best to make sure disabled people get the support most appropriate to their needs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Wits' end'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Toman from Disability Action said disabled people and their families "deserve better".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said generally when families' relationships with providers break down, it can be "very, very lonely" for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"And we see the detrimental impact that this hostile reaction can have on disabled people and their families. Because often the disabled person is confused. And then from the family perspective, they're lost, alone, they're anxious, sleep deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Disabled people and families deserve better than facing a personal challenge just because you want right to be done by yourself or your child."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This, she added, had left people at "their wits' end" and feeling punished – including the person living in a care setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said that it was important to note, however, that this was not in every case and that the charity dealt with some "really positive" cases in which disabled people and their families were content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Still your child'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Toman added that the role of an advocate was vital for families to communicate with providers on their behalf, to ensure that any issues raised focus on "processes" as opposed to "the person".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But she warned that not all families had access to effective advocates and this was an issue that needed to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Meanwhile, Mrs Sharp said removing her daughter from her home of seven years would "wreck her" and would cause her health to decline rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She added that the couple had not gone out of their way to "look for faults".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"That's just being a parent, looking out for your child," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I know she's 39.

Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation, Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients” in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:says measles vaccination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated] communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Doctor was disciplined over treatments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disciplinary action;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The board’s final order stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources and medical support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision in 2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he would modify his practice accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his &lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:silver bullet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:found that his claims;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;A virus ‘that doesn’t really discriminate’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:state health department;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s] another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the outbreak is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t really discriminate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Vaccines prevent measles, vitamin A doesn’t&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:post on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Others echoed that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Understanding infectious disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN’s Amanda Sealy, Meg Tirrell and Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 23:45:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNM0VIbnpDMmVGTnV4UzZLdnBBaGdVMWJlWlNGQ1hQaEJlMXdUYmFLcmc3d3Q1a2FSYVdtM3JuZGZzLUJiZV9QQ1podEZnc3lRa2dLcGw5N2F1aWdySE1RakVPRE43MkdhaGdxRXRaNllCQjU5ZnA1TWV3M1Z4QWlOMjEtNFlvcFdVZ2FKbWZIaEdjZw</guid></item><item><title>What can’t vitamin A do?

While vitamin A is sometimes used to treat measles when someone is already infected, it can’t actually prevent people from getting sick like a vaccine can, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Thomas Russo,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Thomas Russo,&lt;/a&gt; professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York, tells Yahoo Life. But even using vitamin A as a treatment for measles is a bit complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A 2010 &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/39/suppl_1/i48/699532?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientific analysis;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;scientific analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that there was “no significant reduction” in people dying from measles after taking vitamin A treatments across six randomized controlled trials. But, when the researchers broke things down by dose, they found that having at least two doses of vitamin A lowered the risk of dying from measles by 62%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But here’s some important context: “The major studies that have been done about the benefits of the treatment of measles — particularly severe measles — have been done in the developing world where children are often malnourished and don’t have enough vitamin A to begin with,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. William Schaffner,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. In those cases, certain doses of vitamin A, given as early as possible in infected children, may help lower the risk of measles complications like pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), Schaffner explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But that’s in the developing world,” he says.

Worth noting: It’s unlikely that you’d overdose on vitamin A from food alone, notes Russo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bobrick says these are the biggest sources of vitamin A:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Oily fish like salmon, cod liver and mackerel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dark, leafy greens like spinach and kale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you’re considering a vitamin A supplement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vitamin A shows up in some multivitamins, and Kim says those are fine to take. But adding an additional vitamin A supplement on top of that can be dangerous and put you at risk of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Definitely check with a health care provider first — more isn’t always better,” Yang says. “If your diet is balanced, you’re probably getting enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 23:26:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6gFBVV95cUxPbGRDVXEwTF9hWF9mM0lqVkhyVnNJaVdWbHBsSmFUajdfNTVUa2FLQkhGMEpnenY1QnNkYjlDeHhrQ2JiNVE5cU96cXc4ZmVJUzAxMEh5Z20wdFROYUxTOXdnaDY0NmV4MkctVUU5UERKQXkwWkpHY0hVSl9jYUZ1dURvc3BYT0tfRWVuQkp4UEFFY1ZINi1SWWxqb2s2RG11LThDa0JNMzVvMGZTNW01ZTJxWmtkdkZNQldLTjhaWFV5a3ZPVG1BdDNoWGl3WThNeER1SnJoVXhEX3QzbU9DMzMycG5RNWcxYUE</guid></item><item><title>1st case of measles detected in Florida - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxPMzlUUm9lRWRYa0NORTRLVFZUb0lTSFlGZWM0WHpjVlNTeVVIbENRRmNacnJVRmFSTm9jaTNRWUdxSldpU2tJVVBYRkpLQlF2U1FuQ0JqWExBWGFsdEQzV3JiZXdmWXlLLS05ZDlnZDFMZVAwRzhwRERtV08wZTRXVlJzMWU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Florida reported its first case of measles so far this year in a high schooler at Palmetto Senior High School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The state's surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, sent a letter to parents at the school on Tuesday, notifying them of the case -- but the Florida Department of Health official stopping short of advocating typical guidelines for school exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Measles virus particle, illustration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;After a measles case is detected at a school, common public health recommendations are that unvaccinated children stay at home for up to 21 days, the period of time someone could get infected and spread the virus further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Ladapo's letter to parents noted the recommendations, but referred the decision of whether unvaccinated kids should stay at home to parents, saying, "Due to the high immunity rate in the school, as well as the burden on families and educational cost of healthy children missing school, DOH is deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He also noted that the recommendation may change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Miami-Dade School District is prepared to provide remote learning to kids whose parents choose to keep them home, the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Serving as Florida's top health official, Ladapo has previously espoused views that contradict standard public health guidance.

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing better than watching a slab of fresh butter soften and sizzle as you circle it around the skillet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If just the thought of it makes you jump with ghee, you butter beware — that innocent little rectangle could be melting your chances at longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831265?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamainternmed.2025.0205" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine linked greater consumption of butter to increased mortality rates, while &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/15/health/plant-based-diets-best-for-lowering-disease-cancer-risk-study/"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt; oils offer protective benefits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Replacing butter with plant-based oils can slash your risk of early death by a whopping 17%, a new study shows. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;motortion – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed the data of over 200,000 adults and found that replacing &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/03/lifestyle/parenting-experts-warn-against-using-butter-to-lull-restless-babies-to-sleep/"&gt;butter&lt;/a&gt; with plant-based oils can slash your risk of premature death by a whopping 17%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies have demonstrated that replacing butter with plant-based oils can yield health benefits, particularly when it comes to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/health/heart-disease-could-be-prevented-with-this-one-simple-test/"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Schiff, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Northwell Health’s &lt;a href="https://huntington.northwell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Huntington Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, told The Post why butter is so “bad” for you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Butter has been shown to raise LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol in the body, which can clog your arteries and increase your risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/health/your-takeout-containers-could-cause-congestive-heart-failure/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;,” Schiff said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Butter also contains saturated fats, she explained, which are typically solid at room temperature and found in products like butter, coconut oil, lard, cheese and cream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, plant-based oils such as olive and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/11/health/5-swaps-for-butter-that-can-improve-cholesterol-lower-disease-risks/"&gt;avocado oil&lt;/a&gt; are rich in monounsaturated fats, which have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease, as well as anti-inflammatory &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/health/fish-oil-supplement-can-add-this-many-years-to-your-life/"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; — that’s why Schiff uses them “almost exclusively.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Plant-based oils are rich in monounsaturated fats, which have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;tycoon101 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“I use olive oil in salad dressing, for sautéing foods and sometimes in baking,” she said. “It’s high in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/17/health/6-antioxidant-rich-superfoods-can-help-you-live-longer-dietitian/"&gt;plant phenols&lt;/a&gt; — compounds that work as antioxidants and may help prevent cell damage and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added that avocado oil is also a good source of antioxidants, has a neutral taste and can withstand higher cooking temperatures than olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Stick with unrefined olive and unrefined avocado oil,” she advised. ”They’re healthier because they retain more nutrients — vitamins, minerals and antioxidants — than processed and refined oils.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Stick with unrefined olive and unrefined avocado oil,” one nutritionist advised. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dušan Zidar – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/31/health/are-seed-oils-really-that-bad-for-you-dietitians-explain-the-risk/"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;, like cottonseed oil, grapeseed oil and soybean oil, Schiff knows they get a bad rap and have become quite the hot topic on social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The problem with seed oils is the high ratio of omega-6 oils to omega-3 oils,” she explained. “A healthy balance of omega-6s to omega-3s (about four-to-one) can help &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/health/a-handful-of-this-snack-can-boost-mood-and-reduce-cancer-risk/"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the body. High levels of omega-6s versus omega-3s can increase inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem is that “we tend to get a lot of our seed oil from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-foods-are-everywhere-how-bad-are-they/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, and the oils in those foods are often highly refined and processed themselves,” which is why she suggests getting seed oils that are cold-pressed if you want to cook with them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Post Care"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-module__inner"&gt;

					Thanks for signing up!				&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;She believes these oils can still be part of a healthy diet when consumed in moderation and balanced with omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And if you absolutely can’t live without butter, opt for the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/health/im-a-cancer-survivor-here-are-the-everyday-supplies-ive-cut-from-my-kitchen/"&gt;grass-fed&lt;/a&gt; kind, as it has lower amounts of saturated fats and more healthy fats, as well as more vitamin K2 — which helps boost heart health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t like to demonize any food, but I’d recommend grass-fed, pasture-raised butter over conventional butter if you really want to have butter,” Schiff said. “And eat less of it. Lean more towards olive and avocado oil, use unrefined seed oils and avoid ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t forget that “you don’t need to be perfect,” she said, especially since “everyone’s body is different in how it processes fats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of ultra-processed foods on our health has become a topic of increasing concern in recent years. A groundbreaking study conducted by Australian researchers has shed light on the alarming effects of consuming these products daily. The findings, published in the journal Age &amp;amp; Aging in December 2024, reveal that regularly indulging in ultra-processed foods can accelerate biological aging and increase the risk of chronic diseases and mortality.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;The hidden dangers of ultra-processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods, such as chips, cookies, candies, and sodas, have long been associated with adverse health effects. However, the extent of their impact on our bodies has remained unclear until now. The recent study, which analyzed data from over 16,000 American adults, has uncovered disturbing links between the consumption of these products and biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-1821856092"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biological age, a measure that reflects a person’s overall health status, appears to be significantly affected by the intake of ultra-processed foods. The researchers found that for every 10% increase in the consumption of these products, biological aging accelerated by approximately 2.5 months. This means that individuals who consumed the highest amounts of ultra-processed foods were biologically older by about 10 months compared to those who ate the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/05/is-walking-1-mile-per-day-enough-to-reap-health-benefits-experts-weigh-in/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Is walking 1 mile per day enough to reap health benefits? Experts weigh in.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To put this into perspective, Dr. Barbara Cardoso, the lead author of the study, provided a striking example: “Adding an extra 200 calories of ultra-processed foods, roughly equivalent to a small chocolate bar, could advance the process of biological aging by more than two months compared to chronological aging.” This revelation highlights the importance of &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/24/this-is-the-best-time-to-have-dinner-for-good-health-and-to-gain-less-weight/"&gt;maintaining a balanced diet and making informed choices about meal timing&lt;/a&gt; to promote overall health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-1002405031"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;Accelerated aging and increased health risks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings extend beyond the acceleration of biological aging. Researchers also observed a correlation between high consumption of ultra-processed foods and increased risks of mortality and chronic diseases. Dr. Cardoso emphasized the significance of these results, stating, “Our predictions show that for every 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption, the risk of mortality rises by nearly 2%, and the risk of chronic disease increases by 0.5%.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics underscore the urgent need to address our reliance on ultra-processed foods. While it may be tempting to reach for convenient, packaged snacks, the long-term consequences on our health can be severe. It’s worth noting that &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/01/13/eating-pasta-boosts-mood-new-scientific-study-reveals/"&gt;some foods, like pasta, have been shown to have positive effects on mood&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the importance of making informed dietary choices.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of ultra-processed foods extends beyond aging and mortality risk. Numerous studies have linked these products to a wide range of health issues, including cardiovascular problems, brain and mental health concerns, diabetes, obesity, and certain types of cancer. By reducing our intake of these foods, we may be able to mitigate these risks and promote healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/04/forget-yoga-and-pilates-this-sport-is-even-better-for-keeping-a-slim-waist-after-40/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Forget yoga and Pilates, this sport is even better for keeping a slim waist after 40.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Strategies for healthier eating habits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the compelling evidence against ultra-processed foods, it’s crucial to develop strategies for reducing their consumption and adopting healthier eating habits. Dr. Cardoso suggests that “eating fewer ultra-processed foods can help slow down the trajectory of biological aging, providing an additional reason to target ultra-processed foods when considering strategies to promote healthy aging.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One effective approach is to focus on whole, minimally processed foods. Incorporating more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains into your diet can provide essential nutrients without the harmful additives found in ultra-processed products. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/21/people-who-depend-morning-coffee-often-share-these-7-personality-traits/"&gt;being mindful of habits like excessive coffee consumption&lt;/a&gt; can contribute to overall health improvements.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meal planning and preparation can also play a crucial role in reducing reliance on ultra-processed foods. By setting aside time to cook meals from scratch, you have greater control over the ingredients and can avoid the hidden sugars, fats, and additives often present in packaged foods. This approach not only benefits your physical health but can also have positive effects on mental well-being.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;Building resilience and making lasting changes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Changing long-established eating habits can be challenging, but it’s essential for long-term health and well-being. &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/30/people-who-recover-quickly-failure-tend-display-these-8-traits/"&gt;Developing resilience and the ability to bounce back from setbacks&lt;/a&gt; is crucial when adopting healthier lifestyle choices. It’s important to remember that small, consistent changes can lead to significant improvements over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/04/how-much-should-you-walk-after-60-to-live-longer-science-reveals-the-key-distance/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;How much should you walk after 60 to live longer? Science reveals the key distance.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One effective strategy is to gradually replace ultra-processed foods with healthier alternatives. For example, swapping chips for nuts or fresh fruit can satisfy cravings while providing better nutritional value. Similarly, replacing sugary sodas with water or unsweetened tea can significantly reduce calorie intake and improve overall health.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educating yourself about nutrition and food labels can also empower you to make informed choices. Learning to identify ultra-processed foods and understanding their potential health impacts can motivate you to seek out healthier options. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/01/doctor-reveals-five-hidden-effects-of-stopping-alcohol-for-30-days-has-on-the-brain/"&gt;considering the effects of other lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, can contribute to a more comprehensive approach to health and aging.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-5"&gt;Fostering a supportive environment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making lasting changes to our eating habits often requires a supportive environment. &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/12/if-you-want-deeper-connections-say-goodbye-these-7-habits/"&gt;Cultivating deeper connections with like-minded individuals&lt;/a&gt; can provide encouragement and accountability in your journey towards healthier eating. Sharing meals with friends and family who prioritize whole foods can make the transition more enjoyable and sustainable.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community initiatives, such as farmers’ markets and cooking classes, can also play a role in promoting healthier food choices. These programs not only provide access to fresh, minimally processed foods but also offer opportunities to learn new cooking skills and discover delicious alternatives to ultra-processed products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/03/green-tea-is-good-for-your-health-but-its-not-without-risks-especially-for-these-people/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Green tea is good for your health, but it’s not without risks, especially for these people.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By fostering a culture that values whole foods and mindful eating, we can collectively work towards reducing the prevalence of ultra-processed foods in our diets. This shift not only benefits individual health but also has the potential to positively impact public health on a broader scale, potentially reducing the burden of chronic diseases and promoting healthier aging across populations.

            “Butter is a health food with amazing nutrients,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/paulsaladinomd/reel/Cr6QPD9PWn_/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;in a post&lt;/a&gt;, adding that butter is good for the gut, brain, cardiovascular health, and overall health and vitality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0008356mg7148zvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The evidence doesn’t support that view, according to study coauthor Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0009356m4x5tats5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For some reason that is not clear to me, a myth has been floating around the internet that butter is a healthy fat, but there is no good evidence to support this,” said Willett, who has authored over 2,000 articles and numerous books and has spent 40 years studying the impact of diet on the development of major diseases, via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva000a356m7uk6ei5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Willett and his team’s latest research revealed that higher butter consumption was associated with a 15% higher risk of mortality, whereas higher intake of plant-based oils — including soybean, canola and olive oil — was linked to a 16% reduction in total mortality, according to the study published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0205" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.

            In addition, substituting just 10 grams (0.35 ounces) of butter with these plant-based oils daily was associated with a 17% lower risk of both total mortality and cancer-related deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Seventeen percent is quite a big change, especially when you look at the public health perspective,” said Dr. Yu Zhang, study coauthor and researcher at the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Imagine how many deaths we can reduce in the general population.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;

            The study analyzed 33 years of dietary data from more than 221,000 participants in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000k356mkebc0v24@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants self-reported their dietary habits every four years, allowing researchers to track changes over time and calculate long-term intake averages. Researchers adjusted their findings to account for variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, total calorie intake, as well as other dietary patterns using the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/evaluating-adherence-to-recommended-diets-in-adults-the-alternate-healthy-eating-index/1163D3C29653628A1209EB88AE166BF1" target="_blank"&gt;Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000l356mq21xx4jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Butter intake included any amount used in cooking and baking, as well as any extra butter spread on food. Plant-based oil consumption was estimated based on the type of oil used in frying, sautéing, baking or making salad dressings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000m356mbqoxvqnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Marion Nestle, Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health Emerita at New York University, noted the new study is correlational and shows association, not causation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000n356mg3fy4i7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even so, it’s consistent with decades of evidence linking saturated fat to health risks and demonstrating quite substantial health benefits of substituting plant oils (including seed oils) for animal fats,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000o356m6d545vqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seed oils are derived from plant seeds, whereas plant-based oils are extracted from a variety of different plant parts. All oils examined in the study fall under the seed oil category, except for olive oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000p356mq8b1stpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Olive oil, canola oil, and soybean oil were each more consistently associated with benefit: a lower risk of dying,” said cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. “These findings add to a large body of scientific literature on the health benefits of these plant oils, whose positive effects have been demonstrated in both large observational studies and dozens of randomized trials.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkpcl000i356mkz8st1d4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the study indicates that some plant oils lead to better health outcomes, Zhang clarified that this doesn’t mean butter should be eliminated altogether.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000w356m8u6hel68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are not suggesting that people should avoid butter entirely, but we are recommending that even a small reduction in butter in replacement for plant-based oils in a daily diet could lead to very substantial, long-term health benefits,” Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000x356m3aaqlpde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The choice to use butter may depend on available options for the consumer, Willett said. If given the choice between butter and a partially hydrogenated plant oil rich in trans fats, he said, butter might be a better option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000z356mzaex96bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/final-determination-regarding-partially-hydrogenated-oils-removing-trans-fat#:~:text=Final%20Determination%20Regarding%20Partially%20Hydrogenated%20Oils%20(Removing%20Trans%20Fat),-Share&amp;amp;text=In%202015%2C%20FDA%20released%20its,levels%20in%20other%20edible%20oils." target="_blank"&gt;2015 ban&lt;/a&gt; on trans fats passed by the US Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers can still use up to a half of gram of trans fat per serving. That can add up fast in a daily diet, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114#:~:text=Products%20made%20before%20the%20FDA,amount%20is%20below%200.5%20grams." target="_blank"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0010356mcfr8z6l5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, if the decision is between butter and beef tallow — which has been promoted by Kennedy as a healthier substitute for seed oils — canola, soybean and olive oils are the superior choice, Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0011356mo6ehh0v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although beef tallow was not examined in this study, on the basis of its composition we would expect it to be no better than butter,” Willett said, pointing to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5081717/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;previous analysis&lt;/a&gt; he authored that found fat from red meat, which is mostly composed of beef fat, was marginally worse than dairy fat in regards to mortality or cardiovascular disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0012356m3cne1pjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Butter is very high in saturated fat, approximately 2/3 of the fat, and it contains almost none of the beneficial, essential polysaturated fats,” Willett said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0013356m48apf9rn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our findings don’t mean that we should never consume butter, but it is best to use it just when its specific flavor is important, not as a primary source of fat,” he added. “For me, this is the several times a year that I have lobster … butter is absolutely essential!”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhlde3000u356m2zy31gqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re looking to make the switch to plant oils or debating which ones to use, it’s all about finding a balance to include some of the essential nutrients your body needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001a356m7175xqrq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Olive, canola and soybean oils had the most beneficial impact on health outcomes in the study, according to Zhang, which comes from their high levels of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s maintain the body’s cells, provide energy, maintain immune defense and reduce inflammation when it’s at optimal levels (like most things, too much omega-3 &lt;a href="https://news.oregonstate.edu/news/excess-omega-3-fatty-acids-could-lead-negative-health-effects" target="_blank"&gt;may be harmful&lt;/a&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001b356m9h2fmamr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other seed oils such as corn, peanut, safflower and sunflower contain higher levels of omega-6 fatty acids, which are also necessary to maintain good health.&lt;br&gt;Omega-6 molecules stimulate hair and skin growth, regulate metabolism, support bone health, and in some cases, may even have &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/health/fish-oil-heart-wellness/index.html"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xix6es00053b6mvx4hnm61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, omega-6s can also be converted into molecules such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3081099/#:~:text=Prostaglandins%20play%20a%20key%20role,cardinal%20signs%20of%20acute%20inflammation." target="_blank"&gt;prostaglandins&lt;/a&gt; that signal the initiation of inflammation — not a bad thing when your body is trying to quickly repel an invader or tumor, but devastating if left smoldering for long periods without resolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001d356mrajvtkds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Americans have an overabundance of omega-6s in their bodies due to their use in ultraprocessed foods and eating at fast food establishments. One omega 6, &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/omega-6-fatty-acids" target="_blank"&gt;linoleic acid&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#reference78" target="_blank"&gt;most common omega-6&lt;/a&gt; in the US food supply.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001c356mrl6nbie5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids; soybean and canola oil have both,” Willett said. “Corn and sunflower oil have very little omega-3 fatty content; these can be part of a mix of different oils, but should not be relied upon as a sole source of plant oil.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001e356m8op9xti9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No matter which oils you’re using in your diet, it’s best to use them sparingly, Nestle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001f356ma260ua5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m always for varying food intake to the extent possible and that goes for oils, as well,” she said.  “All oils, no matter which, provide about 120 calories per tablespoon so are best used in the proverbial moderation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over a century, scientists have analyzed the vast microbial world within the human body. They’ve found bacteria, fungi, and viruses that influence our health in many ways. We thought we had a decent idea of what lies in our bodies. But nature, as it so often does, seems to have thrown us a curveball.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hidden within the microbial communities of our gut and mouth, researchers have identified thousands of tiny, virus-like genetic entities. They’re not viruses, not bacteria, and they don’t look like anything we’ve seen before. They call them obelisks — flattened, rod-shaped loops of RNA that challenge fundamental assumptions about what constitutes life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have likened it to “fossils from another world.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-obelisks"&gt;What Are Obelisks?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery of obelisks came from a deep dive into genetic databases. Led by Ivan Zheludev and Andrew Fire at Stanford University, a team of scientists analyzed &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38293115/"&gt;massive metatranscriptomic datasets&lt;/a&gt; — collections of RNA sequences extracted from human stool and saliva samples. What they found was astonishing: nearly 30,000 distinct sequences forming RNA circles that were unlike anything in recorded biology. They’re so unusual we wouldn’t even know where to put them on the tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make things even stranger, they seem to be remarkably common. These structures have been detected in approximately 7% of gut bacteria and 50% of oral bacteria samples worldwide, suggesting a widespread presence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obelisks sort of look like viruses but unlike viruses, they don’t have an outer protein coat. Their structure is reminiscent of viroids — plant pathogens composed of simple RNA loops that also don’t have a protein coat. But obelisks are not found in plants. Instead, they inhabit bacterial species, including &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus sanguinis&lt;/em&gt;, a common microbe in human mouths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear what they actually do. They don’t seem to be pathogens, so they may just be benign passengers, quietly existing within bacteria without altering their hosts. Alternatively, they could play an active role in microbial genetics, potentially influencing bacterial behavior or even interacting with human cells. They could have significant impacts for digestion, immunity, or even diseases; but we don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;So… what do we know about them?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also identified unique proteins, tentatively named &lt;em&gt;oblins&lt;/em&gt;, encoded by obelisk genomes. Unlike traditional viroids, which do not encode proteins, these RNA loops seem capable of producing molecules that might interact with bacterial or even human cells. It’s hard to say what this actually means, but the fact that these proteins do exists suggests that obelisks are either something between a viroid and a virus or something entirely new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s insane,” says Mark Peifer, a cell and developmental biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/it-s-insane-new-viruslike-entities-found-human-gut-microbes"&gt;for Science&lt;/a&gt;. “The more we look, the more crazy things we see.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They could be evolutionary relics — remnants of an ancient stage in the development of life. They could even be a missing link in the evolutionary history of viruses, suggesting that viral genomes may have once been simple RNA circles like these before evolving into more complex infectious agents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We don’t even know if these obelisks are alive. In fact, scientists have been debating whether viruses are alive for decades (because they can’t replicate independent of a host cell’s molecules). Obelisks seem to be even simpler “creatures” and they could end up forcing us to reconsider what we even consider to be “alive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite their mysterious nature, obelisks could have practical implications for medicine and microbiome research. If they play a role in regulating bacterial populations, they might influence conditions linked to the gut microbiome, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, or even mental health disorders. Future research will need to explore whether obelisks interact with human health in ways that warrant medical attention — or if they are merely another hidden feature of the vast microbial world inside us.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike previous BCIs, which lasted only a few days, this AI-enhanced device worked reliably for seven months. The AI model adapts to natural shifts in brain activity, maintaining accuracy over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After training with a virtual arm, the participant successfully grasped, moved, and manipulated real-world objects. The technology represents a major step toward restoring movement for people with paralysis. Researchers are now refining the system for smoother operation and testing its use in home settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Stability:&lt;/strong&gt; The AI-enhanced BCI functioned for seven months, far longer than previous versions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The system adjusts to daily shifts in brain activity, maintaining accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-World Use:&lt;/strong&gt; The participant controlled a robotic arm to pick up objects and use a water dispenser.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at UC San Francisco have enabled a man who is paralyzed to control a robotic arm through a device that relays signals from his brain to a computer.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was able to grasp, move and drop objects just by imagining himself performing the actions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device, known as a brain-computer interface (BCI), worked for a record 7 months without needing to be adjusted. Until now, such devices have only worked for a day or two.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108079"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a man and a robotic hand." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Ganguly is now refining the AI models to make the robotic arm move faster and more smoothly, and planning to test the BCI in a home environment.   Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BCI relies on an AI model that can adjust to the small changes that take place in the brain as a person repeats a movement – or in this case, an imagined movement – and learns to do it in a more refined way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This blending of learning between humans and AI is the next phase for these brain-computer interfaces,” said neurologist, Karunesh Ganguly, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology and a member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. “It’s what we need to achieve sophisticated, lifelike function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, appears March 6 in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key was the discovery of how activity shifts in the brain day to day as a study participant repeatedly imagined making specific movements. Once the AI was programmed to account for those shifts, it worked for months at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location, location, location &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly studied how patterns of brain activity in animals represent specific movements and saw that these representations changed day-to-day as the animal learned. He suspected the same thing was happening in humans, and that was why their BCIs so quickly lost the ability to recognize these patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly and neurology researcher Nikhilesh Natraj, PhD, worked with a study participant who had been paralyzed by a stroke years earlier. He could not speak or move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had tiny sensors implanted on the surface of his brain that could pick up brain activity when he imagined moving.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether his brain patterns changed over time, Ganguly asked the participant to imagine moving different parts of his body, like his hands, feet or head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he couldn’t actually move, the participant’s brain could still produce the signals for a movement when he imagined himself doing it. The BCI recorded the brain’s representations of these movements through the sensors on his brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly’s team found that the shape of representations in the brain stayed the same, but their locations shifted slightly from day to day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From virtual to reality &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly then asked the participant to imagine himself making simple movements with his fingers, hands or thumbs over the course of two weeks, while the sensors recorded his brain activity to train the AI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the participant tried to control a robotic arm and hand. But the movements still weren’t very precise.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Ganguly had the participant practice on a virtual robot arm that gave him feedback on the accuracy of his visualizations. Eventually, he got the virtual arm to do what he wanted it to do.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the participant began practicing with the real robot arm, it only took a few practice sessions for him to transfer his skills to the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could make the robotic arm pick up blocks, turn them and move them to new locations. He was even able to open a cabinet, take out a cup and hold it up to a water dispenser.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months later, the participant was still able to control the robotic arm after a 15-minute “tune-up” to adjust for how his movement representations had drifted since he had begun using the device.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly is now refining the AI models to make the robotic arm move faster and more smoothly, and planning to test the BCI in a home environment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with paralysis, the ability to feed themselves or get a drink of water would be life changing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly thinks this is within reach.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very confident that we’ve learned how to build the system now, and that we can make this work,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other authors of this study include Sarah Seko and Adelyn Tu-Chan of UCSF and Reza Abiri of the University of Rhode Island. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (1 DP2 HD087955) and the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and robotics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#65170a070c0b4b0804170e1625100616034b000110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robin Marks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Robin Marks – UCSF&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.02.001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sampling representational plasticity of simple imagined movements across days enables long-term neuroprosthetic control&lt;/a&gt;” by Karunesh Ganguly et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sampling representational plasticity of simple imagined movements across days enables long-term neuroprosthetic control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nervous system needs to balance the stability of neural representations with plasticity. It is unclear what the representational stability of simple well-rehearsed actions is, particularly in humans, and their adaptability to new contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an electrocorticography brain-computer interface (BCI) in tetraplegic participants, we found that the low-dimensional manifold and relative representational distances for a repertoire of simple imagined movements were remarkably stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manifold’s absolute location, however, demonstrated constrained day-to-day drift. Strikingly, neural statistics, especially variance, could be flexibly regulated to increase representational distances during BCI control without somatotopic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discernability strengthened with practice and was BCI-specific, demonstrating contextual specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampling representational plasticity and drift across days subsequently uncovered a meta-representational structure with generalizable decision boundaries for the repertoire; this allowed long-term neuroprosthetic control of a robotic arm and hand for reaching and grasping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study offers insights into mesoscale representational statistics that also enable long-term complex neuroprosthetic control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:55:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE0yOXBTR09fTHo5Zm10c2F6SVFQSDlYNHBMTVpiQXNjcVp6RmZGZUFsQWNtUzZtNVM5YldnUVJpaVluUnJzTGViWmdEN19NckhFNTZ1R0N5cDF0RmNienB4Qm1PQ3JxVDFxRGQxdzlKMA</guid></item><item><title>The Real-Life Diet of a Harvard and MIT Scientist Who Says the Right Diet Can Make You Smarter - GQ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1iUjdCY09BVTRtTng0VV9NYWU4U3lkd1Y2cko4ZFA4RWt3LTIxMHZadWZJWDQ5RnFJeElSLUZBYVVjVm1ILWdJZG0yQ2pOQTFDM2FTNk56dHBsTDI3M2RXeF9LLVo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Omega-6 fatty acids, which are present in nuts and seeds and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7596305/"&gt;are essential for brain development&lt;/a&gt; and health, must be consumed in balance with Omega-3s to support overall well-being. Excessive consumption of Omega-6 fatty acids relative to Omega-3s has been associated with inflammation and various health issues, so balance is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-9 fatty acids—which you can find in olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds—though not essential&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33054628/"&gt;, can contribute to cognitive function and cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; when included in a diet rich in diverse fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;What other foods top the list of being “the best” for brain health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods loaded with antioxidants&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/foods-linked-to-better-brainpower"&gt;, including berries and leafy green vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, safeguard the brain against oxidative stress, thereby improving brain efficiency and promoting healthy aging. Additionally, whole grains and vitamin E-rich foods, such as nuts and seeds, are important for vascular health, which is essential for optimal brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Are there specific foods that can help people improve specific brain functions, like concentration and memory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain foods have a significant effect on memory and concentration, primarily due to their rich nutrient profiles. Omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins found in foods like fatty fish, berries, and leafy greens aid in boosting brain function, enhancing memory, and staving off cognitive deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;I’m afraid to ask… but what’s the deal with coffee?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods that enhance focus, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/coffee-obsession"&gt;such as those with caffeine and L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;—which are present in coffee and green tea—enhance alertness and attention by influencing neurotransmitter dynamics. I usually only drink coffee once or twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;This is terrible, but not unexpected, news. What’s the alternative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opting for green tea as an alternative to coffee is generally a good idea. Green tea is rich in caffeine, known to boost alertness and concentration, and also contains &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/theanine#:~:text=Oral%20supplementation%20with%2050%E2%80%93200,serotonin%2C%20dopamine%20and%20other%20neurotransmitters."&gt;L-theanine, which supports a state of calm alertness&lt;/a&gt;, possibly enhancing focus while reducing feelings of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;What else do you avoid in your diet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I minimize sugar intake—although I do enjoy a piece of chocolate a couple of times a week—and I only eat red meat once or twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Do…I need to do that too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support brain health, it's advisable to limit intake of processed and high-sugar foods (like sugary beverages, candy, cupcakes—all things we stuff ourselves with as children and habituate as comfort foods!), as they can impair cognitive function and memory. Consumption of alcohol and red meats has also been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7071474/"&gt;linked to negative impacts on brain health&lt;/a&gt;. Foods high in saturated and trans fats should also be minimized, as they can lead to decreased brain health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Does &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you eat make a difference in all of this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a profound link between your dietary habits and your brain's health. The science is really just in its infancy for this—and there appears to be a “no one-case fits all”—so people need to experiment to find what works best for them. Having said this, patterns are emerging. Consuming meals at regular, consistent times helps regulate the body's internal clock, stabilizing blood sugar levels and ensuring a steady supply of energy to the brain, which is crucial for maintaining cognitive functions and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;So, where does intermittent fasting come into play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting, which involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting, has been shown to benefit brain health. This practice may enhance brain function by reducing oxidative stress, improving brain cell growth, and decreasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the optimal intervals for eating can vary depending on individual health conditions, lifestyle, and dietary needs. Generally, fasting for 14 or more hours a day is recommended (so, for example, finish dinner by 6 p.m. and have breakfast at 8 a.m.), but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best eating schedule for your specific health goals and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Any other secrets we need to know about how to hack our diets to get smarter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been experimenting with adaptogens—which are natural substances that typically come from an herb, root, or mushroom.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Ngashi Ngongo, MD, PhD, MPH, who leads Africa CDC's mpox incident management team, said, &lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;It&lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s a good testimony of the high acceptance.” He added that the DRC&lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s health ministry has two strategies in Kinshasa, one targeting entire populations in hot spots, and one targeting contacts of confirmed cases in other locations. The campaign includes children as young as 1-year old, and the vaccination rate has already reached 51.6% of the initial target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More transmissible clade 1b variant detected in Kinshasa&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In a worrying development, Ngongo said the recently identified clade 1a virus that has the APOBEC3 mutation, linked to more transmissibility, has been reported from Kinshasa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Last week, Africa CDC officials described the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/who-extends-mpox-emergency-more-transmissible-clade-1a-variant-identified-dr-congo"&gt;&lt;span&gt;emergence of the new clade 1a variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The APOBEC3 mutation had been found in the newer clade 1b virus, a change thought to contribute to its heightened transmissibility. The older clade 1a virus is thought to be more deadly and more able to cause severe disease, and officials said a more transmissible form of clade 1a raises significant public health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Overall cases in the region have gradually trended downward over the last 5 weeks, but officials have said the trend should be interpreted with caution, due to decreased and slowed testing in the eastern part of the DRC where violence is flaring, slowing testing and impacting the medical care of mpox patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;African countries have reported 24,272 cases this year from 15 nations, and 260 people have died from their infections. Ngongo said Angola reported its first two confirmed cases from two different provinces after 8 weeks with no cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Ngongo said the violence in the mpox hot spot forced 605 mpox patients to flee health centers, and so far 150 people with severe infections have returned to continue their care. More than 2 million people have been displaced internally or across borders due to the violence in the eastern part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In a positive development, scaled up infection prevention and control activities consisting of training and supply procurement in the DRC has seen a 50% reduction in mpox infections in health workers, he said. In October 2023, 104 health worker infections were reported, which dropped to 52 in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Using the MISS brain-mapping technique, they profiled 1.3 million cells in mice to pinpoint which cell types are most affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings show that glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus are particularly susceptible, while cortical neurons and oligodendrocytes appear more resistant. Surprisingly, the distribution of brain cell types predicted tau buildup better than genetic risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that cellular composition, rather than genetics alone, plays a critical role in Alzheimer’s progression. The study offers valuable insights that may guide future efforts to slow or prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell Type Vulnerability:&lt;/strong&gt; Glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus are more prone to tau accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Brain Cells:&lt;/strong&gt; Oligodendrocytes appear less affected, potentially playing a protective role.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Genetics:&lt;/strong&gt; The distribution of brain cell types predicts tau buildup better than genetic risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UT Arlington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers from The University of Texas at Arlington and the University of California–San Francisco have used a new brain-mapping technique to identify memory-related brain cells vulnerable to protein buildup, a key factor in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, an incurable, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Texas, nearly half a million people live with Alzheimer’s disease, a form of dementia that costs the state approximately $24 billion in caregiver time, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108075"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/alzheimers-brain-mapping-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Interestingly, the researchers also discovered that oligodendrocytes, brain cells that help insulate nerve fibers, were less affected by tau. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas ranks fourth in the nation for Alzheimer’s cases and second in Alzheimer’s-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why certain parts of the brain are more affected by Alzheimer’s disease, researchers focused on tau, a protein that accumulates in brain cells and disrupt normal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the MISS (Matrix Inversion and Subset Selection) mapping technique, which profiled approximately 1.3 million cells, the research team created detailed maps of different cell types in the brains of mice. They compared these maps to areas where tau builds up to identify which cell types are most affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings are published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications Biology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using mathematical and computational models, we found that certain cells in the hippocampus, a brain area important for memory and navigation, are more vulnerable to tau buildup,” said author Pedro Maia, an assistant professor of mathematics at UTA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These glutamatergic neurons showed a strong connection with tau deposits, meaning they are more likely to be affected. In contrast, brain cells in the cortex—the part of the brain that controls movement, sensory information, emotions and reasoning—were less likely to be affected by tau.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers also discovered that oligodendrocytes, brain cells that help insulate nerve fibers, were less affected by tau. This suggests that these cells might help to protect the brain against tau buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the distribution of different cell types in the brain may better predict where tau accumulation occurs than genetic factors alone. This implies that the types of cells present in different brain regions may be more important than Alzheimer’s-related genes in determining vulnerability to tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, this study helps us understand why certain brain regions are more affected by tau buildup leading to Alzheimer’s disease,” Dr. Maia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying the cell types and gene functions involved, our study showcases how theoretical and computational models can provide new insights into the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is another piece of valuable data that will help us specifically target the vulnerable cells and genes associated with tau buildup, potentially slowing or preventing Alzheimer’s disease progression in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Maia’s work, visit the NSF RTG Training in Mathematics for Human Health program, which he co-leads on computational neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by the following NIH grants: R01NS092802, RF1AG062196 and R01AG072753.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain mapping and Alzhiemer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e58e84918d80978c8b80cb87808b8b809191a5909184cb808190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katherine Bennett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uta.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT Arlington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katherine Bennett – UT Arlington&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-07575-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Searching for the cellular underpinnings of the selective vulnerability to tauopathic insults in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Pedro Maia et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for the cellular underpinnings of the selective vulnerability to tauopathic insults in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease exhibit pathological changes in the brain that proceed in a stereotyped and regionally specific fashion. However, the cellular underpinnings of regional vulnerability are poorly understood, in part because whole-brain maps of a comprehensive collection of cell types have been inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we deployed a recent cell-type mapping pipeline, Matrix Inversion and Subset Selection (MISS), to determine the brain-wide distributions of pan-hippocampal and neocortical cells in the mouse, and then used these maps to identify general principles of cell-type-based selective vulnerability in PS19 mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that hippocampal glutamatergic neurons as a whole were significantly positively associated with regional tau deposition, suggesting vulnerability, while cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons were negatively associated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also identified oligodendrocytes as the single-most strongly negatively associated cell type. Further, cell-type distributions were more predictive of end-time-point tau pathology than AD-risk-gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using gene ontology analysis, we found that the genes that are directly correlated to tau pathology are functionally distinct from those that constitutively embody the vulnerable cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, we have elucidated cell-type correlates of tau deposition across mouse models of tauopathy, advancing our understanding of selective cellular vulnerability at a whole-brain level.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:39:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE4xRXVRTHRXQks5a1JpWVZPV2FYTUxFMEhQUUlVSkY3YzhEdV9nN3B6aHJHTV8zdl9oQ3B5cEctZVh4dXpvMHV4ODgzc1NyN002bXhCVlM2UzBweEpsYm54ZGtNX1FYWkgxWHBlYQ</guid></item><item><title>Avian flu outbreaks in Queens spark further calls to shut down all overcrowded NYC wet markets - QNS</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE0xSVFzZ3d5M29oc0ZSWmltUkVCOGZ4cTZobkc2akd3SWVvbEp6ZmluOV9oc1VVMkRoYy1BeUpBelpsbDdzeEM3ZWhodE9ud0loNzBMZ2JNRjF6VXVhVjFBTm0xM0tvNGVMM281aWdEbHoxUmM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of avian flu at two animal slaughter markets in Queens has renewed urgent calls to shut down New York City’s densely packed wet markets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest outbreaks come just weeks after a temporary closure in February, when an undercover investigation by &lt;a href="https://nyclass.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NYCLASS&lt;/a&gt; and Council Member Robert Holden revealed squalid conditions at live animal markets in Queens and Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGYXSW_JoV9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;disturbing footage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was captured after the markets were temporarily closed for five days in February due to a previous avian flu outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="emp-d4473" class="emp-ad-article-leaderboard"&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I see a lot of sickly looking birds. They’re stuffed into cages and are literally on top of each other,” remarked Holden, who represents the District 30 neighborhoods of &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/ridgewood/"&gt;Ridgewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/maspeth/"&gt;Maspeth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/middle-village/"&gt;Middle Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/glendale/"&gt;Glendale,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/elmhurst/"&gt;Elmhurst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/rego-park/"&gt;Rego Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-J2ZCYteD" data-type="float"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The outbreaks have sparked further alarm among animal rights activists, public health officials, and concerned citizens, who argue that such markets are unsafe to operate amid a bird flu crisis. Advocates have called for immediate and indefinite closure of these markets until proper control measures are in place to address both animal welfare and public health concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="emp-ed36b" class="amp-action"&gt;    
                        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;NYCLASS Executive Director Edita Birnkrant has been vocal in her criticism of the state’s response, accusing Gov. Kathy Hochul of failing to take adequate action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Birnkrant emphasized that these latest outbreaks should serve as a clear indication that operating these markets during a bird flu outbreak is reckless and puts public health at risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She called on Governor Hochul to shut down the markets indefinitely, pointing out that allowing them to remain open amidst the ongoing crisis contributes to the spread of avian flu and other infectious diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the major concerns raised by advocates is the lack of transparency regarding which markets were affected by the avian flu outbreaks. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health officials have not disclosed which specific slaughter markets had confirmed cases, leaving the public in the dark about potential exposure. Without this information, consumers are left uncertain whether the poultry they purchase could be infected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_512998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512998" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512998" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?w=363" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg 828w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=363,700 363w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=768,1482 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=622,1200 622w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=796,1536 796w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=199,384 199w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=466,900 466w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512998" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Birds with open wounds were still stuffed in overcrowded cages in this wet market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;via Instagram @nyclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Birnkrant argued that this lack of accountability is unacceptable and amounts to malpractice on the part of health agencies and government officials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the avian flu outbreaks, NYCLASS has documented troubling conditions at live markets in Queens and Brooklyn. The organization has reported overcrowded cages containing sick and injured birds, many showing signs of infection, including necrotic wounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Often overcrowded and unsanitary, these markets have long been a source of concern for animal rights groups. Birds at these markets are typically kept in appalling conditions, leading to a variety of health issues, including infections and injuries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Advocates argue that these markets not only endanger the animals but also create an environment where zoonotic diseases, like avian flu, can easily spread.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The situation is further compounded by reports of hazardous conditions on public streets near the markets. NYCLASS captured footage of an open dumpster dripping with blood and filled with bags of rotting chickens, many of which were torn open with feathers scattered about. The lack of sanitation and safety protocols for both the animals and the public is a major point of concern. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People shopping at these markets are exposed to close contact with sick animals without any personal protective equipment (PPE) or safety measures. According to experts, this creates an ideal environment for the transmission of infectious diseases, including avian flu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Veterinarians and public health experts have also weighed in on the risks posed by these markets. Dr. Crystal Heath, a veterinarian, pointed out that live markets, which allow for direct interaction between the public and stressed animals, are breeding grounds for disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With thousands of people coming into close contact with sick or stressed animals, the conditions are ripe for an influenza virus to jump to humans. The close quarters, lack of sanitation, and high-stress levels among the animals significantly increase the likelihood of disease transmission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_512991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512991" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?w=700" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg 1024w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=700,468 700w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=384,257 384w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=900,602 900w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Markets were temporarily shut down in New York in February due to bird flu. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;Photo by Lokman Vural Elibol /Anadolu via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, Dr. Heath noted that such environments increase the risk of avian flu reassorting with the seasonal flu, potentially creating a virus with pandemic potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health risks extend beyond avian flu, as animals in these markets are often exposed to various bacterial infections, respiratory diseases, and other health issues due to overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Animal rights organizations like Woodstock Farm Sanctuary have also expressed concern, sharing their experiences with animals rescued from these markets. The sanctuary has taken in numerous animals directly sourced from New York City’s live markets. Upon examination, many of them have shown signs of infections, neglect, and untreated health issues. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of the animals rescued were so severely compromised that they passed away shortly after their rescue. The conditions these animals endure, both in the markets and in transport, are a major concern for organizations advocating for animal welfare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Furthermore, concerns have been raised about the lack of testing and oversight on factory farms, where many of the birds sold in these markets are sourced. Critics have pointed out that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/news/new-york-state-announces-further-proactive-measures-prevent-avian-influenza-live-bird-markets#:~:text=New%20York%20State%20Agriculture%20Commissioner,York's%20poultry%20as%20well%20as" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;testing a small sample of birds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from massive factory farms and declaring them free of avian influenza is insufficient and irresponsible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The overcrowded conditions at these farms not only contribute to the spread of avian flu but also result in a host of other health problems for the birds. Animal rights activists argue that the lack of proper regulation and oversight at both factory farms and live slaughter markets is contributing to the ongoing crisis and putting both animal and public health in jeopardy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_512992" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512992" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512992" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?w=700" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg 1024w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?resize=700,467 700w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?resize=384,256 384w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512992" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Advocates are calling for the complete shutdown of these overcrowded and unsanitary markets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;Photo by Lokman Vural Elibol /Anadolu via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In light of the continuing outbreaks and the evidence of hazardous conditions, calls for the permanent closure of these markets have grown louder. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;John Di Leonardo, President of &lt;a href="https://www.humanelongisland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Humane Long Island&lt;/a&gt;, warns that failure to take immediate action could lead to the spread of diseases with far-reaching consequences for public health. Just as COVID-19 originated in live markets, avian flu presents a much greater risk, with the potential for devastating consequences if the virus were to mutate or spread further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, there are currently no human cases of avian flu, and the threat to the public is still low.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Following continued proactive surveillance of NYC’s live bird markets, Department inspectors detected HPAI in two live bird markets in Queens. Results were later confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL),” the Department of Agriculture and Market stated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Both markets immediately closed and completed depopulation, cleaning, and disinfection and will now remain closed for a period of five days. They will be allowed to reopen following an additional inspection. In order to protect impacted businesses and farms, the Department releases county-level information regarding HPAI detections and not the names of the businesses.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Animal welfare groups, health professionals, and concerned citizens continue to urge Gov. Hochul and city officials to act swiftly to close these markets and implement stricter regulations to ensure the safety of both the animals and the public. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
