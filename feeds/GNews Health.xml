                                        &lt;p&gt;A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLhHL8pjYRc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prevent development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 60,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a remarkable thing, right?” said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/online-first?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the medical journal Pediatrics. Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn’t implemented this public health effort,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 declined by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015 and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effort hasn’t yet reduced an overall increase in food allergies in the U.S. in recent years. About 8% of children are affected, including more than 2% with a peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergy is caused when the body’s immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King’s College London, published the groundbreaking &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Learning Early About Peanut Allergy,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or LEAP, trial. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the new research offers “promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact,” the authors concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide,” said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research &amp;amp; Education, or FARE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters,” he said. “These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her own sons, James, 4, and Cameron, 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;At first, Leon’s own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations,” she said. “So when someone told me, ‘This is how it’s done now, these are the new guidelines,’ I just though, OK, well, this is what we’re going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A study conducted by researchers at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/george-mason-university" target="_blank"&gt;George Mason University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; revealed that individuals who consumed mango daily had better blood sugar control and reduced body fat compared to those who opted for low-sugar snacks. The study’s findings, published in Foods in August 2025 under the title “Daily Mango Intake Improves Glycemic and Body Composition Outcomes in Adults with Prediabetes: A Randomized Controlled Study,” emphasize that the nutritional context of sugar within whole foods plays a more crucial role than the sugar content alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Science Behind Mango’s Benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Science Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Raedeh Basiri, Assistant Professor in George Mason’s Department of Nutrition and Food Studies, explained that it’s not simply about how much sugar food contains, but about the overall nutritional makeup. Mangoes, for instance, offer a unique balance—while they contain natural sugars, these are accompanied by fiber, antioxidants, and essential vitamins. This combination helps slow sugar absorption, keeping blood glucose levels stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_124570023" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-124570023"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, foods that contain added sugars—such as processed cereals or packaged low-sugar snacks—lack this natural balance and can actually heighten the risk of developing diabetes. The fiber in mangoes supports digestion and promotes satiety, helping control appetite and preventing overeating, which further aids weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Glycemic Index and Safe Consumption Tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangoes fall within a moderate range on the glycemic index (GI), scoring between 51 and 56, a range comparable to orange juice. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/american-diabetes-association" target="_blank"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (ADA), this places mangoes in the low-to-medium GI category, making them suitable for moderate consumption. The ADA recommends choosing fruits that are fresh, frozen, or canned without added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_124570023" id="div-vdoai-mid-124570023"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical serving of fruit should provide around 15 grams of carbohydrates, which roughly equals two-thirds of a cup of mango. The ADA also notes that fresh fruit tends to be more satisfying than dried varieties, as the portion size of dried fruit is smaller and can lead to excessive intake of sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-124570023" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124570023" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124570023" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124570023" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Additional Health Perks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond controlling blood sugar, mangoes may also improve cholesterol levels. A study published in the British Journal of Nutrition in 2011 observed that mice fed a high-fat diet supplemented with freeze-dried mango exhibited lower body fat, reduced cholesterol, and improved glucose levels compared to those treated with lipid- or sugar-lowering drugs like fenofibrate and rosiglitazone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research underscores that incorporating whole fruits like mangoes into one’s diet not only satisfies sweet cravings naturally but also supports metabolic health, making this tropical fruit a surprisingly smart choice for balanced living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Signs Of High Blood Sugar&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a Cleveland Clinic report, early signs of high blood sugar, also known as hyperglycemia, often appear gradually and may include excessive thirst or hunger, frequent urination, headaches, and blurred vision. These symptoms occur as the body struggles to manage rising glucose levels. If left unchecked for a longer period, chronic hyperglycemia can lead to more serious issues such as persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, recurring vaginal yeast or skin infections, and slow-healing cuts or sores. Recognizing these warning signals early is crucial, as timely lifestyle changes and medical intervention can help prevent severe complications like nerve damage or diabetes-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How To Keep Blood Sugar In Check?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maintain healthy blood sugar levels, focus on a balanced diet rich in fiber, whole grains, lean proteins, and non-starchy vegetables. Limit refined sugars, processed foods, and sweetened beverages. Eat smaller, regular meals to prevent spikes and dips in glucose. Stay active with at least 30 minutes of daily exercise, such as brisk walking or yoga. Manage stress through meditation or deep breathing, as stress hormones can raise blood sugar. Get enough sleep and stay hydrated. Regularly monitor blood glucose levels, and follow your doctor’s advice to keep your sugar within a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;meta content="cms.article3" name="cmsei-article3"&gt;&lt;div class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 01:26:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAJBVV95cUxQNkQzYUE3YktFWHNVSHpSYzZrVWtrY083WWthSEhacWprS20wR01OUjc2ZlpVSFRnWUdVbVRhZEpPNER1LWFlWEtRNFVZU3RPR2g2dkJWRi1QNlNDNHpTY3o0MGItYTF6N2pZOEl6UWlDMV8tOWNTaHdjSS1qTF9ZX2cwUXhoaklrQ1NlSkZzQkpwSWVVT1lLNS1adjlrUnpGSTZndzNoM1RqOEdmUndQSU84VkJKQ0JYaTlZVkhpT3dVdnBVd2NUYkwtZmJNbGJFU2F2V1VCdmw5TGxaTHlvNVA3TU01NERjdGpzbm50eVB3VEREM1pnN3pTc2xDMkVm</guid></item><item><title>最后一名埃博拉患者在刚果民主共和国出院，世卫组织表示-半岛电视台</title><link>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/last-ebola-patient-discharged-from-dr-congo-who</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;header class="article-header"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Last Ebola patient discharged in DR Congo, WHO says&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article__subhead"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barring new cases, the patient’s recovery kicks off a 42-day countdown to declaring the country’s 16th outbreak over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;div class="article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20"&gt;&lt;div class="article-dates"&gt;&lt;p class="date-simple"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Published On 19 Oct 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;19 Oct 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="rich-share" data-testid="rich-share"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-share__wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="rich-share__button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;button class="rich-share__button row" aria-expanded="false"&gt;&lt;p class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Click here to share on social media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;svg class="icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 " viewbox="0 0 20 16" version="1.1" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;title&gt;share2&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path fill="#000" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;p class="rich-share__social-text"&gt;Share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last Ebola patient in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been released from a treatment centre in Kasai province, according to the United Nations health agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient is the 19th to recover out of 64 total cases recorded since the &lt;a href="/news/2025/9/4/dr-congo-announces-new-ebola-outbreak"&gt;outbreak was declared&lt;/a&gt; in September, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;If no new cases are discovered in the next 42 days, the outbreak will be declared over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohamed Janabi, the WHO’s director for Africa, said the recovery was a “remarkable achievement”, given the outbreak began just six weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The country’s robust response, with support from WHO and partners, was pivotal to this achievement,” he added in a social media post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;In a video alongside the post on X, health workers were seen celebrating as the final patient exited the treatment centre in Bulape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak, which is the DRC’s 16th to date, was declared on September 4 as Ebola cases appeared in the Bulape and Mweka areas of the Kasai province in the country’s southwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the WHO has tallied 53 confirmed and 11 probable cases, with patients showing typical Ebola symptoms such as fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and haemorrhaging. Forty-five people have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remote Kasai province has proven challenging to reach, even as it may have helped to prevent the spread of the virus, health officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the WHO deployed response teams and set up a 32-bed treatment centre for the first time “outside a simulation exercise” in the region, the organisation said. More than 35,000 people have received vaccinations in the Bulape area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No new cases have been identified since September 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebola was first identified in 1976 after an outbreak in what is now the DRC. Without treatment, up to 90 percent of cases are fatal, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest outbreak occurred from 2014 to 2016 in West Africa, ultimately infecting 28,600 and killing 11,325 people, with the disease also spreading to Europe and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DRC’s most recent outbreak occurred in 2022 and involved just one &lt;a href="/news/2022/9/27/dr-congo-declares-end-latest-ebola-virus-outbreak"&gt;recorded case&lt;/a&gt; of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 21:43:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxORGtKRkZXYlJ3ckRtWW1fS2oxQ1ZIbU16V00zeXNZeHFhVGkxdWdMazBzT1RYWGEybU5wRXE0NTZmZFJHUldqYkJhWExjbXI0SDBYcGRZcDdQU3lqQlBLbVlvM21UMHRQUDNmY2lRWmZLUTVlbTFnVDNRZ3g5M0FiM3pQQU1Kd0lNdmNCWnliU3hrNmvSAZgBQVVfeXFMT0RrNmh4X0pYZlY5bGJkWnhwd3hhaFV0aEdXQXg1bUZGTHdiTUhIQlhTc3VLQ2xnaHJEd1VKaWdaMnNBRVMyTmVoS2FiRGZsMmJYeEFuUUhfZkNYcmxhSkdiSHNOUDNiN3BIbHNqdkVGTkpYbmFBSTI5NmdyMlZZTi1iNldVMW5tb2R6bmhqQjEtQUx1TjlTQW8</guid></item><item><title>美国男性突然精子数量极低。现在，专家们知道原因了--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15202593/American-men-lower-sperm-count-RFK-Jr.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/rfk-jr/index.html" id="mol-3b3392c0-ad2b-11f0-a063-adc1283ccd93"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; has issued a dire warning about the state of the nation's &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fertility/index.html" id="mol-a2445110-ab8d-11f0-a84b-2965f463c46a"&gt;fertility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Oval Office on Thursday, the Health and Human Services Secretary said&lt;span&gt;: 'Today, the average teenager in this country has 50 percent of the sperm count, 50 percent of the testosterone as a 65-year-old man.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 71-year-old continued: 'Our girls are hitting puberty six years earlier, and that's bad, but also our parents aren't having children.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the Daily Mail has spoken to three experts who say Kennedy is bringing important attention to an issue they have been worried about for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they added it did not appear his claims were completely true, and they were unaware of any data showing teenagers had testosterone levels half as high as 65-year-old men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't clear if the secretary was comparing sperm counts in today's teens and seniors or sperm counts when today's seniors were teens several decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the experts warned studies do suggest sperm counts appear to be trending downward across the generations, which may be driven by higher obesity rates and sedentary lifestyles, as well as exposure to environmental pollutants like plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On girls entering puberty earlier, they also said that while they were not aware of evidence that showed it was happening six years earlier, studies do show that the age for a first period is also trending to earlier in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Junior, the Health and Human Services Secretary, is pictured above with Donald Trump at the press conference yesterday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Stephen Lazarou, a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF, told the Daily Mail: 'I think there is a general sense that testosterone levels may, indeed, be declining across the [male] generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is some evidence, or some speculation, that there may be contributing environmental or lifestyle factors, and we believe that that might be secondary to more sedentary lifestyles or increasing obesity rates.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr David Shusterman, a urologist who runs a men's fertility clinic in New York City, added: 'I have seen that testosterone levels are on the decline in my clinic, especially even for younger men, and that may be what Kennedy is trying to draw attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In some cases, these men appear otherwise normal, you know, they are not overweight or have other factors that would put them at higher risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK Jr made the comments at a press conference hosted by President Donald Trump Thursday but had also mad&lt;span&gt;e the same claims in April, telling Fox News that a teenager today has less testosterone than a 68-year-old man and a sperm count that is 'down 50 percent.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said: 'Secretary Kennedy is sounding the alarm on a public health issue others are too timid, or too politically cautious, to confront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A growing body of peer-reviewed research shows significant declines in sperm counts over the past decades, and pretending this isn't a serious trend is irresponsible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They pointed to two studies from 2017 and 2022, which both warned that sperm counts had dipped 52 percent among men from 1973 to 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testosterone is the male sex hormone and is behind secondary male characteristics such as a deeper voice and facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It peaks in men in the early 20s before gradually declining by about one to two percent per year, which researchers say is a natural part of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts told the Daily Mail that symptoms of low testosterone include low sex drive, fatigue, decreased muscle mass, depression, and weak bones, among others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also linked to sperm counts, with normal levels signaling for sperm production while lower levels can lead the body to produce less sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High testosterone levels, as a result of supplements or testosterone injections, can also slash sperm counts, however, by interfering with the other hormonal signals needed for sperm production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689?login=false"&gt; a 2017 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689?login=false"&gt;Human Reproduction Update&lt;/a&gt;, and indicated by HHS, scientists surveyed sperm counts from 185 studies involving nearly 43,000 men conducted between 1973 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that sperm counts had declined 52 percent over this period in &lt;span&gt;North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, the same researcher, environmental medicine expert Dr Shanna Swan at Mount Sinai in New York, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/29/2/157/6824414?login=false"&gt;published a second follow-up analysis&lt;/a&gt;, also cited by HHS, with Dr Swan telling &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/28/shanna-swan-fertility-reproduction-count-down"&gt;The Guardian &lt;/a&gt;her work suggested that the median sperm count could reach zero by 2045.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts have raised concerns over the paper, saying it compared semen samples where different methods were used to count sperm, which may make the results unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But another paper from&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39128669/"&gt;January 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; similarly found that, after surveying samples from 11,700 men from between 1970 and 2018, there had been a 'modest decline' in sperm counts, although researchers added it would not affect fertility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many experts have been raising the alarm over declining fertility in men for decades, with the cause being unclear, although it has previously been linked to environmental toxins affecting the testicles, as well as poor diets and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say a healthy man has a testosterone level between 300 and 1,000 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL), with a man with levels below this considered to have low testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear how many men have low testosterone, although symptoms of the condition include erectile dysfunction, loss of muscle mass, increased body fat and mood changes such as irritability or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Testosterone levels peak in young adulthood, around age 20, but decline by about 1 percent annually after age 30. This data is from a University of Wisconsin study &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have also found evidence that young girls are now starting puberty earlier than ever before, but not the six years earlier that RFK Jr claims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One paper published in JAMA in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819141?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;May last year&lt;/a&gt; found that while women born between 1950 and 1969 started their periods at 12.5 years old on average, for those born between 2000 and 2005, the average age was 11.9 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that the proportion of girls starting their puberty before the age of 11 had risen from 8.6 to 15.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while the proportion starting their periods before the age of nine was still small, it had more than doubled during the same time frame from 0.6 to 1.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have said childhood obesity could be behind the shift, as well as diet, psychological stress and environmental factors such as toxins that disrupt hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it has alarmed officials, who say the change could be behind a higher risk of heart disease, cancer, miscarriages and even premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not all the experts agreed with RFK Jr, however, with Dr Jeff Singer, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in the Department of Health Policy Studies, telling this website: 'What I CAN say is that Secretary Kennedy has taken a couple of real studies and turned them into a sensational sound bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's some evidence of modest downward trends across generations, likely tied to lifestyle and health factors, but nothing close to Kennedy's doomsday framing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'His claim badly distorts the data, confusing normal aging with supposed generational collapse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Is it OK to mix and match meals if there’s one I don’t like?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels.

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 381 to 422 calories, while the lunches span 394 to 505 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200-calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_189-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides eating a well-rounded diet with plenty of fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats, there are a few other lifestyle changes you can make for healthy aging. For one, try to stay active through a mix of aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening and balance work. This promotes &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-break-for-better-metabolic-health-8751700" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt; and helps prevent falls. It also helps combat age-related losses in muscle mass and bone density.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_190-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_191-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also, don’t underestimate the importance of a good night’s sleep. This is when your body and brain slow down to rest and recover from the wear-and-tear of the day. Studies show that not getting enough quality sleep is linked with higher rates of depression, dementia, falls and cognitive decline. Other things that support healthy aging include keeping up with regular checkups with your health care providers, minimizing your alcohol intake, quitting smoking, regularly socializing and keeping your mind active through reading, writing or games.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/strong&gt; One of the latest fitness fads trending on social media is “Japanese walking,” a 30-minute exercise regimen in which you alternate walking at a normal pace with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/11/health/walking-fast-benefits-study-wellness"&gt;bursts of speed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s easy to see the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking is a relatively short, accessible workout that doesn’t require a gym membership or special equipment. All you have to do is walk out the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I like about Japanese walking is that anyone can do it,” said Dr. Irvin Sulapas, a sports medicine physician and associate professor at UTHealth Houston. “You don’t need to do super high-intensity workouts, where you’re sore and tired, to gain improvements to your health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese researchers developed this exercise regimen — hence the moniker Japanese walking — more than 20 years ago. The goal was to increase physical fitness among middle-aged and older adults, plus help this group prevent &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/lifestyle-diseases-economic-burden-health-services"&gt;lifestyle-related diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interval walking may protect older people from higher blood pressure, the researchers found. The activity may also help combat decreased thigh muscle strength and diminished peak aerobic capacity, according to the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/"&gt;July 2007 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This same research team found in a related &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19752116/"&gt;2009 review&lt;/a&gt; that five months of interval walking training increased participants’ physical fitness and improved their indices of lifestyle-related diseases by an average of 10% to 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, older adults who practiced Japanese walking for five months showed improvements in resting blood pressure, lower-limb muscle strength and &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/vo2-max-what-is-it-and-how-can-you-improve-it"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;, a key indicator of cardiovascular fitness and aerobic endurance, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40582858/"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; by a different group of scientists. This latest research may have sparked Japanese walking’s current popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interval walking — and other forms of exercise — are definitely good for your heart health and well-being, said Dr. Sergiu Darabant, a medical cardiologist at Miami Cardiac &amp;amp; Vascular Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But Japanese walking is intriguing to many because it offers an entry to exercise from a sedentary lifestyle,” Darabant said. “It’s not intimidating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2007 study, researchers instructed participants to alternate three minutes of fast walking at 70% peak aerobic capacity — a moderate- to high-intensity pace — with three minutes of slower walking at 40% peak aerobic capacity, a low-intensity exercise level, for at least 30 minutes on four days per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s generally the same advice experts give today, although Darabant suggested upping the walk to five days per week. If you do so, you’ll be getting 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week, the exact recommendation for aerobic activity from the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you know if you’re walking fast enough during your speedy minutes? Walk as fast as you can without breaking into a jog, Darabant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally, a brisk walk is considered around 4 miles per hour, although everyone’s different,” Sulapas said. Four miles per hour equates to a 15-minute-per-mile pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any exercise, safety is key. Before rushing outside to try Japanese walking, consult your doctor, and stop immediately if you experience pain. Keep in mind you can also practice Japanese walking indoors on a treadmill, especially if your streets aren’t well-paved, it’s icy out, or you don’t have a safe place to walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re using a treadmill, set the incline at 1% to 2%,” Sulapas said, as this incline best mimics the resistance the average person gets from walking outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you do have the option of performing this workout alfresco, especially in a natural setting, that’s the best option, Darabant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Engaging with the outdoors is 100% better,” he said. “It not only helps your overall physique, but it helps &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/health/forest-bathing-wellness"&gt;engage your mind, reduces anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and connects you with nature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Transitioning to other forms of exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’re a pro at Japanese walking, you may want to consider advancing to jogging or walking with a weighted vest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more intense the level, the better outcomes you’ll see,” Darabant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet in the end, committing to your exercise regimen is most important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t mean this as a pun, but exercise is a marathon, not a sprint,” Darabant said. “We should all aim for consistency and a clear lifestyle change. Embarking on an exercise journey should be done gradually.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sulapas agreed. “Interval walking is a great start to someone’s fitness journey,” he said. “As you become more fit, you can always up the intensity. But there are definitely health benefits, even if you stick with interval walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which, incidentally, both physicians practice. Sulapas employs Japanese walking toward the end of the half-marathons he runs. “By then,” he said, “I’m kind of hurting!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darabant turns to Japanese walking whenever he’s short on time and energy. “It’s always my go-to backup,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The-CNN-Wire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;™ &amp;amp; © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center describe this as a milestone in more than a decade of work developing mRNA-based treatments that activate the body's immune defenses against cancer. Building on an earlier UF study, the results represent an important step toward creating a universal cancer vaccine capable of enhancing the effects of immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis, which examined medical records from over 1,000 MD Anderson patients, is still preliminary. However, if upcoming randomized clinical trials confirm these results, the impact on cancer care could be profound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The implications are extraordinary -- this could revolutionize the entire field of oncologic care," said senior researcher Elias Sayour, M.D., Ph.D., a UF Health pediatric oncologist and the Stop Children's Cancer/Bonnie R. Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research. "We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilize and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Coller, Ph.D., a leading mRNA expert at Johns Hopkins University, noted that the findings highlight yet another way Operation Warp Speed (the U.S. government's rapid COVID-19 vaccine initiative) continues to benefit lives in "unique and unexpected ways."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results from this study demonstrate how powerful mRNA medicines truly are and that they are revolutionizing our treatment of cancer," Coller said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented today (October 19) at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin, the study builds on eight years of Sayour's research combining lipid nanoparticles with mRNA. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is present in every cell and carries the instructions for making proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Sayour's laboratory made an unexpected discovery: to trigger a strong immune attack on cancer, it was not necessary to target a specific tumor protein. Instead, they could simply stimulate the immune system to respond as if it were fighting a viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pairing their experimental "nonspecific" mRNA vaccine with immune checkpoint inhibitors -- common cancer drugs that help the immune system recognize and destroy tumors -- the researchers observed a powerful antitumor response in mice. This experimental vaccine was not specific to COVID or any other virus or cancer but used similar technology to COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That breakthrough inspired former UF researcher and current MD Anderson scientist Adam Grippin, M.D., Ph.D., to ask a key question: Could the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine have a similar immune-boosting effect in cancer patients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore that idea, the team analyzed data from patients with Stage 3 and 4 non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma treated at MD Anderson between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings showed that patients who received a COVID mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy survived significantly longer than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sayour, the most striking improvements occurred in patients who, based on tumor biology and other factors, were not expected to respond strongly to immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these results are from an observational study and require confirmation through a randomized clinical trial, researchers emphasize their potential importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the need for further validation, Sayour described the discovery as pivotal for the future of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although not yet proven to be causal, this is the type of treatment benefit that we strive for and hope to see with therapeutic interventions -- but rarely do," said Duane Mitchell, M.D., Ph.D., Grippin's doctoral mentor and director of the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute. "I think the urgency and importance of doing the confirmatory work can't be overstated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lung and skin cancers, doctors commonly engage the immune system with drugs designed to "release the brakes" and recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. In advanced disease stages, however, most patients don't respond well and often have exhausted other treatment options like radiation, surgery and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study involved records of 180 advanced lung cancer patients who received a COVID vaccine within a 100-day period before or after starting immunotherapy drugs and 704 treated with the same drugs who did not receive the vaccine. Getting the vaccine was associated with a near doubling of median survival, from 20.6 months to 37.3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the metastatic melanoma patients, 43 received a vaccine within 100 days of initiating immunotherapy, while 167 patients did not receive a vaccine. With the vaccine, median survival increased from 26.7 months to a range of 30 to 40 months; at the time the data were collected, some patients were still alive, meaning the vaccine effect could be even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving non-mRNA pneumonia or flu vaccines resulted in no changes in longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To back their findings, UF researchers then used mouse models to pair immunotherapy drugs with an mRNA vaccine targeted specifically at COVID spike protein. Those experiments showed they could turn unresponsive cancers into responsive ones, thwarting tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the mechanisms for how this works is when you give an mRNA vaccine, that acts as a flare that starts moving all of these immune cells from bad areas like the tumor to good areas like the lymph nodes," Sayour said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to launch a large clinical trial through the UF-led OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network, a consortium of hospitals, health centers and clinics in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, California and Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of our key motivations at OneFlorida is to move discoveries from academic settings out into the real world and the places where patients get care," said Betsy Shenkman, Ph.D., who leads the consortium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the new findings unlock numerous possibilities, and the researchers said an even better nonspecific universal vaccine could be designed. For patients with advanced cancers, the increased survival from such a universal vaccine could provide a priceless benefit: more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If this can double what we're achieving currently, or even incrementally -- 5%, 10% -- that means a lot to those patients, especially if this can be leveraged across different cancers for different patients," said Sayour, an investigator with UF's McKnight Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Cancer Institute and multiple foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sayour, Grippin and Mitchell hold patents related to UF-developed mRNA vaccines that are licensed by iOncologi Inc., a biotech company born as a "spinout" from UF in which Mitchell holds interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Yet liver cancer remains a serious concern, often slipping under the radar until its late stages. In 2022, over 759,000 lives were lost to liver cancer worldwide. It is now ranked as the third leading cause of cancer related deaths globally, and as overall cancer fatalities are projected to cross 10 million by 2025 making early awareness and intervention crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Not Just a Drinker’s Disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, liver cancer was closely linked to heavy alcohol consumption and hepatitis infections. However, recent trends show a worrying rise in cases among non-drinkers. The culprit is often MASLD (Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Liver Disease) and its severe form, MASH (Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatohepatitis). In these conditions, excess fat accumulates in the liver, causing long-term inflammation and scarring that can eventually lead to cancer even without the traditional causes like alcohol or viral hepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle factors such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, sedentary habits and poor dietary choices play a significant role, making even young adults susceptible. The challenge is that early symptoms are vague or non-existent, so many people remain unaware of their risk until the disease is advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The Importance of Early Detection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection saves lives. I recommend routine liver screenings, especially for individuals with diabetes or a family history of liver disease. Liver function tests and abdominal ultrasounds can detect early changes in the liver before cancer develops or worsens. Unfortunately, many avoid check-ups until symptoms become severe, missing a critical therapeutic window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Exploring Modern Treatment Options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver cancer treatment varies widely based on the stage of the disease and patient’s overall health. Surgery, including liver resection or transplantation, offers the best chance for a cure but isn’t always feasible, especially in late-stage cancer. Other options include ablation therapies, systemic treatments like chemotherapy or targeted drugs, and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One increasingly important treatment is Transarterial Chemoembolization, or TACE. This minimally invasive technique delivers chemotherapy directly to the tumor while cutting off its blood supply, limiting tumor growth. It’s generally palliative but can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life when surgery is not an option. Globally, TACE has become a standard of care for many patients, slowing disease progression and reducing complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, a 21-year-old gym enthusiast came to us with severe abdominal pain and exhaustion. Despite regular exercise and a clean diet, he was diagnosed with primary liver cancer. The tumor was too large and located unfavourable for surgery, so TACE was chosen. This helped control the tumor and alleviate symptoms, enabling him to maintain a good quality of life while continuing treatment. This case reflects growing global trends - liver cancer no longer follows old patterns, necessitating vigilance across all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lifestyle and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While liver cancer presents a serious challenge, many risks can be minimized through lifestyle modifications. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains supports liver health, as does staying well-hydrated and engaging in regular physical activity - aiming for at least 150 minutes per week through walking, cycling, swimming, or any similar activities. Avoiding alcohol consumption, smoking, and environmental toxins also lowers risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination against hepatitis B is critical in many regions, and maintaining safe practices to prevent hepatitis C infection rounds out preventive care. Regular health check-ups enable early problem detection and timely intervention, which can be lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Liver Cancer Awareness Month, the message is clear: liver cancer is a silent threat that can affect anyone. Increased awareness, proactive lifestyle choices, and timely medical screening can help detect problems early and improve outcomes, offering hope against a rising global health challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;(Dr Rajesh V.

They may disappear completely next year — and nationwide, they are also in peril. The Trump administration has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/06/opioid-crisis-harm-reduction-funding/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;declared that no federal funding&lt;/a&gt; can go toward supplies that “promote or facilitate drug use” — even though decades of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK598959/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that syringe programs reduce disease transmission rates and do not appear to increase injection frequency or neighborhood crime rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="Image" data-file="components/Image/Image.js" data-style="stitches" class="wpds-c-bTCZLY wpds-c-bTCZLY-idZwvW-type-default"&gt;&lt;figure id="image-3NOMDAU2FVGIMINWR3M5NNPXQI" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-XgEPk-type-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3NOMDAU2FVGIMINWR3M5NNPXQI_size-normalized.JPG&amp;amp;high_res=true&amp;amp;w=2048 1x" src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3NOMDAU2FVGIMINWR3M5NNPXQI_size-normalized.JPG&amp;amp;high_res=true&amp;amp;w=2048"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wpds-c-kaVXjn wpds-c-kaVXjn-fTrHqK-type-large"&gt;Timmons delivers pizza and other supplies to people in the city's impoverished Boxtown neighborhood.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Text/Text.js" data-style="stitches" id="7TRKWKEJN5B63LE23G34QAEFPI" data-contentid="7TRKWKEJN5B63LE23G34QAEFPI" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Evansville has never authorized needle exchanges. Advocates, such as Timmons, who have lobbied for needle exchanges are losing hope — even as fentanyl and methamphetamine users continue to inject with used needles.

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy, were originally intended to treat diabetes — and didn’t become blockbuster prescriptions until doctors realized that they were also potent weight loss aids that seem to re-wire patients’ relationship to food and satiety. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Since then, it’s slowly been emerging that they have another surprising effect: many users report less of a desire to throw back as many drinks as they did before starting the injections. Indeed, several small studies have found promising&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;evidence that the drugs indeed curb&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/ozempic-lowers-alcohol-craving-semaglutide-study-11678702" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;cravings for alcohol&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16679" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;opioids&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they also hold promise to treat a range of addiction disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Exactly why remains hazy, though. It’s &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2025/04/ozempic-addiction-glp-1s-mounjaro-lembke.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;generally established&lt;/a&gt; that GLP-1s target the brain’s dopamine reward system, but scientists are still working to understand the exact mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Adding&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to the complexity is that the drugs make other changes to the body’s functioning that could interact with substance use in complex ways. Take  a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17927-w" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal&lt;em&gt; Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; by Virginia Tech researchers this week, for instance, which found that GLP-1s appear to physically change the way our bodies process alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In the study, participants drank&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;three alcoholic drinks over the course of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an hour while researchers tracked their&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;blood alcohol, glucose, and vital signs. Compared to non-users, the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the participants on GLP-1s reported feeling less drunk overall — and had the readings to prove it: their&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;blood alcohol level rose more slowly, meaning the buzz was delayed and less significant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It’s not hard to imagine why. GLP-1s are known to slow gastric emptying of the stomach, which could likely result in alcohol reaching the bloodstream more slowly. But it once again shows how nuanced these drugs’ effects on our bodies and minds is: it may well be that an injection like semaglutide is both changing the neurological reward associated with alcohol, while simultaneously changing the way your stomach and gut processes a drink. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Exactly how the latest finding affects doctors’ understanding of GLP-1 as a tool to fight addiction is hard to say — and the test group was small, at only 20 subjects, so further research is needed — but a sharper picture is slowly coming into focus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Why would this matter? Faster-acting drugs have a higher abuse potential,” said Alex DiFeliceantonio, a Virginia Tech neuroscientist who worked on the study, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-glp-drugs-delay-alcohol-effects.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;blurb about the research&lt;/a&gt;. “They have a different impact on the brain. So if GLP-1s slow alcohol entering the bloodstream, they could reduce the effects of alcohol and help people drink less.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When we’re in good health, we typically &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cold-flu/how-to-sleep-with-a-cough/"&gt;cough&lt;/a&gt; an average of 18.6 times a day – a number which rises to 275 times when we’re ill. And with winter fast approaching, the sounds of all kinds of coughs – from dry or rattling to hacking, wheezy and hoarse – are only going to ramp up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite what our grannies may have believed, coughs – like the sore throats they’re so often accompanied by – are not caused by going out in the cold or sleeping with wet hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This remains a common health myth that I overhear parents telling their children in the clinic,” says Dr Nisa Aslam, a GP and the chief medical officer at Inuvi. “It’s not true though. Research shows that exposure to cold alone does not trigger these illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, common triggers include viruses (such as colds, flu and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cold-flu/why-so-many-people-have-covid-and-how-to-avoid-new-strain/"&gt;Covid&lt;/a&gt;), bacteria (&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cold-flu/pneumonia-bronchitis-flu/"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, strep) which are spread by direct contact with saliva or mucus, allergens or pollutants, and even acid reflux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-anchor" id="skip-to" name="skip-to"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skip to:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, even the clearing of one’s throat would empty out a room and have us reaching for a Covid test. But a cough, also known as a &lt;em&gt;tussis&lt;/em&gt;, isn’t necessarily a bad sign. “Essentially a cough is a protective reflex and usually shows that your lungs and immune system are doing their job,” says Aslam. “When nerves in your airways detect a problem, your brain triggers a forceful expulsion of air – the cough – to clear away irritants like mucus, dust, smoke, or germs.” Here are the different types, what they mean for your health and how to treat them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Dry cough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tickling or irritating sensation deep in the throat or a sudden urge to cough are marks of a dry cough. And often it becomes worse at night. “This type of cough won’t have any mucus and is usually caused by viral infections like the common cold or flu,” say Kiran Jones, a clinical pharmacist at Oxford Online Pharmacy. However, she adds: “A more consistent dry cough could also be caused by regular exposure to smoke, dust, pollution or asthma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best treated with:&lt;/strong&gt; suppressants to reduce the urge to cough, especially at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Tickly cough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a more specific type of dry cough where people often feel a consistent itch or tickly sensation in the throat, triggering a repeated cough,” says Jones. “Most often these are caused by inflammation of the airway, allergies, or dry air.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best treated with: &lt;/strong&gt;suppressants to soothe the irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Chesty cough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A chesty cough will produce mucus to clear it from congested lungs and airways. It’s our body’s natural response to getting rid of infections like colds or bronchitis,” says Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can be uncomfortable and even verge on painful, but they’re important for part of our recovery when we have a particularly rough cold or flu.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best treated with:&lt;/strong&gt; an expectorant to help loosen the mucus, making it easier to cough up and expel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Wet cough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will be able to tell from the sound you’re making that the cough is not “dry” and likely is producing mucus or phlegm “usually from chest infections or post-nasal drip”, says Aslam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best treated with:&lt;/strong&gt; expectorants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Whooping cough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a highly contagious bacterial infection that can cause intense coughing fits and a ‘&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/parenting/children/whooping-cough-symptoms-treatment/"&gt;whooping&lt;/a&gt;’ sound when breathing in,” says Jones. “Anyone experiencing this type of cough should seek medical advice as soon as these symptoms are recognised, as it’s a particularly dangerous infection for babies and young children, but it can affect adults too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best treated with:&lt;/strong&gt; don’t attempt to use over-the-counter medicines, you need to see your GP as antibiotics are the best course of treatment and the sooner the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These remarkable individuals perform on memory tests as well as people 30 years younger, challenging the long-held idea that mental decline is an unavoidable part of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the decades of research, scientists have noticed that SuperAgers often share certain lifestyle and personality traits, such as being highly social and outgoing. However, according to Dr. Sandra Weintraub, professor of psychiatry, behavioral sciences, and neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, the most astonishing discoveries have come from looking directly at their brains. "It's really what we've found in their brains that's been so earth-shattering for us," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pinpointing the biological and behavioral features linked to SuperAging, the researchers aim to develop new ways to strengthen cognitive resilience and slow or prevent Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that exceptional memory in old age is not only possible but is linked to a distinct neurobiological profile. This opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life," said Weintraub, corresponding author of a new paper summarizing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper was published as a perspective article in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association&lt;/em&gt;, published in a special issue marking both the 40th anniversary of the National Institute on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Centers Program and the 25th anniversary of the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SuperAger brains are resilient, resistant &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "SuperAger" was first introduced by Dr. M. Marsel Mesulam, founder of the Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease at Northwestern, in the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, 290 SuperAgers have participated in the study, and researchers have examined 77 donated SuperAger brains after death. Some of these brains contained amyloid and tau proteins (also known as plaques and tangles), which are key hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, while others showed no buildup at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a SuperAger," Weintraub said. "One is resistance: they don't make the plaques and tangles. Two is resilience: they make them, but they don't do anything to their brains."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;key findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptional memory performance:&lt;/strong&gt; SuperAgers score at least 9 out of 15 on a delayed word recall test -- on par with individuals in their 50s and 60s.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youthful brain structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike typically aging brains, SuperAgers show no significant thinning of their cortex -- the outer layer of the brain -- and even have a thicker anterior cingulate cortex than younger adults. This crucial region of the brain plays a significant role in integrating information related to decision-making, emotion and motivation.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique cellular traits:&lt;/strong&gt; SuperAgers have more von economo neurons, which are specialized cells linked to social behavior, and larger entorhinal neurons, which are critical for memory, than their typically aging peers.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sociability as a common trait:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite having diverse lifestyles and varying approaches to exercise, SuperAgers tend to be highly social and report strong interpersonal relationships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain donation can offer scientific immortality'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Mesulam Center, SuperAgers are evaluated annually and may choose to donate their brains for post-mortem evaluation by Northwestern scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Many of the findings from this paper stem from the examination of brain specimens of generous, dedicated SuperAgers who were followed for decades," said co-author Dr. Tamar Gefen, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Feinberg, director of Feinberg's Laboratory for Translational Neuropsychology and a neuropsychologist at the Mesulam Center. "I am constantly amazed by how brain donation can enable discovery long after death, offering a kind of scientific immortality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perspective piece is titled, "The First 25 Years of the Northwestern SuperAging Program." Other Northwestern authors include Dr. Mesulam and Changiz Geula, research professor of cell and developmental biology and neuroscience at Feinberg and a member of the Mesulam Center.&lt;/p&gt;

For couples, however, it can feel especially vital. Transparency and openness are often cited as the single most important things two partners can strive for; it’s the supposed glue that holds everything else together. And in many ways, this is true.

The truth is that not all honesty is as helpful as we think it is, and, in a similar vein, not all silence is as &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/01/31/a-psychologist-explores-6-types-of-lies-and-how-they-affect-us/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/01/31/a-psychologist-explores-6-types-of-lies-and-how-they-affect-us/" target="_self" aria-label="deceitful"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/01/31/a-psychologist-explores-6-types-of-lies-and-how-they-affect-us/"&gt;deceitful&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as we’ve been led to believe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research increasingly suggests that knowing when &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;to speak can sometimes preserve connection much more safely than brutal honesty ever could. In some scenarios, choosing kindness and tact over “telling it like it is” will serve both you and your partner much, much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s perfectly okay to keep to yourself in a relationship, according to psychological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;1. Bodily Changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might feel natural for you to point out a change you’ve recently noticed in your partner’s body. Bringing the bit of weight they’ve gained, the few new wrinkles they’ve developed or the breakout that wasn’t there before to their attention might even seem like a kindness — like you’re helping them look after themselves. After all, we’re told that honesty is part of caring: if you see something, say something. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to comments about your partner’s body, even well-intentioned observations can come across as nitpicking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1037/fsh0000223" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://doi.org/10.1037/fsh0000223" aria-label="research"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://doi.org/10.1037/fsh0000223"&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Family, Systems, &amp;amp; Health,&lt;/em&gt; around 55% of individuals will leave a conversation about their weight with their romantic partner feeling worse about themselves. Note that this finding was also irrespective of how the conversation was initially framed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, whether the comment is gentle (“You’ve filled out a little lately”), joking (“Someone’s been enjoying their dessert!”) or supposedly supportive (“Hey, maybe we should start working out together”), the result is still likely to be the same: insecurity, self-consciousness and shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine times out of ten, whatever change you’ve noticed will not be news to your partner. They live in their body every day of their life, so if you’ve noticed it, then they’ve almost certainly already noticed it, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MWrh7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In long-term relationships, physical changes are inevitable. Different seasons of life will beget differences in our bodies: weight fluctuations, gray hairs, looser skin. It’s human, and it’s to be expected. Unfortunately, however, mainstream beauty standards have taught us to view these changes as flaws, rather than pieces of evidence of life unfolding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, by drawing attention to a change you’ve noticed , even in the kindest, most casual manner, your partner is still likely to interpret it through that same harsh lens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the next time you catch yourself about to mention a change in your partner’s body, pause. Ask yourself whether what you’re about to say is truly kind. And, more importantly, assess whether or not it’s truly necessary. If, instead, it’s just something you’ve been conditioned to point out then, chances are, your comment won’t be as constructive as you intend it to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because, in reality, those “imperfections” may just tell a lovely story. A little bit of weight gained might simply reflect the comfort and joy of the meals you’ve shared together, made with love. Stretch marks represent your growth together — whether into adulthood, parenthood or simply a new chapter of life. And wrinkles are a map of every smile, laugh and late-night conversation you’ve shared together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;2. Unconstructive Criticism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what romcoms and love stories might tell you, it’s totally normal to have a couple things that you don’t particularly like about your partner. They may be wonderful and loving in every other way — except for, perhaps, the way they handle stress, their tendency to procrastinate, the friends they keep or some of their lifestyle choices you think aren’t the best for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might, on the odd occasion or on a particularly hard day, feel tempted to make your dislike for these things known to them. You might even believe that the principle of honesty in your relationship demands it of you. However, there’s a very fine line between being helpfully honest and being needlessly critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-base embedly-align"&gt;&lt;fbs-embedly iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FyKJx490j7ks%3Fstart%3D34%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D34&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DyKJx490j7ks&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FyKJx490j7ks%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube"&gt;&lt;/fbs-embedly&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If what you plan to tell them doesn’t come from a place of genuine desire to help your partner better themselves or their ways, then there’s little to no chance that it will come across as constructive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, you might think that saying, “You always waste money on things you don’t need,” or, “You really shouldn’t eat that, it’s so unhealthy,” will lead them to make better choices. But in your partner’s eyes, it’s probable that they simply see it as you attacking them, rather than as a useful insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2015.10.007" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2015.10.007" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2015.10.007"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Behavior Therapy&lt;/em&gt; explored, the ways your partner will perceive your criticisms of them can vary greatly. However, this depends very largely on how those criticisms are framed; some forms are much more damaging than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the study note that when individuals interpret their partner’s comments as being hostile, they’re also likely to report lower relationship satisfaction and poorer overall well-being. Constructive feedback, on the other hand, is usually paired with reports of a  stronger, more stable relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching aim of the study was to uncover why it is that these perceptions differ from one couple to another — and, overall, the findings suggest that it usually comes down to emotional regulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partners who were prone to suppressing their emotions (holding back frustration or masking irritation) were more likely to come across as critical or hostile in their partner’s eyes, even if that wasn’t their intention at the start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, those who engaged in cognitive reappraisal (essentially reframing their thoughts before speaking) were much better able to give feedback that was genuinely supportive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that when you’re driven by irritation instead of empathy, your partner will almost certainly tell the difference in the way it comes out. What may feel to you is “honest” will read to them as judgment. This, in turn, will both knock their confidence and their sense of safety around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, before you share that piece of unsolicited feedback, it’s worth pausing to check in with yourself as to whether you’ll be saying it because you want to help, or, rather, because you just want to be right. If your motivation feels as if it’s leaning toward the latter, then the kinder — and more productive — choice would be to simply let it go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although constructive feedback can indeed improve a partner’s well-being, and even the relationship as a whole, unconstructive criticism has the power to do the exact opposite. If you don’t have the capacity to be constructive, then being silent is a kindness. Sometimes, you need to choose your relationship over the fleeting satisfaction you’ll get from being “honest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you be your truest self  in your relationship, without the fear of being criticized or scrutinized?

The researchers found that there wasn’t a lot of data to support the broad recommendation to follow a high-fiber diet, but they did identify two foods and a drink that seemed to help: kiwi, rye bread, and mineral water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings “can now be rapidly implemented into clinical practice, thereby improving clinical care and patient outcomes,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does kiwi help constipation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons this simple fruit might be a boon, according to Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69074230%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It has an enzyme in it called actinidin, which is really beneficial for promoting good digestion,” she says. Kiwis also contain soluble and insoluble fiber, both of which help you poop, explains Keri Gans, RDN, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69074230%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Small Change Diet;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Small Change Diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often recommend kiwis for digestion in my practice,” Cording adds. If you really want to get the most fiber from your kiwi, Cording says you can eat the fruit with the skin on, although “a lot of people find the texture off-putting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does rye bread help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rye bread is a form of whole grain bread, Cording notes. “One-hundred percent whole rye has slightly more fiber than 100 percent whole wheat bread, and contains prebiotic fibers that help nourish beneficial gut bacteria," Gans says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just keep in mind that this bread contains gluten. So, "if your constipation has to do with gluten intolerance, it probably won’t be helpful,” Cording says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does mineral-rich water help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a pretty big range of “mineral water” options out there, but the ones that contain magnesium and sulfates may be most helpful because the minerals can help draw water into the intestines and support smoother bowel movements, Gans says. "They may offer gentle relief for constipation, and since hydration is key for fiber to do its job, sipping mineral water can be a simple way to support digestive health," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cording also points out: “Any water can be helpful for constipation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might generic high-fiber diets not be the key?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to stress this: The researchers didn’t find that high-fiber diets were bad. They just discovered that there wasn’t enough data to suggest that following a &lt;em&gt;generic&lt;/em&gt; high-fiber diet is good for constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber is a really important piece of the picture, but fluid and movement can also be really supportive,” Cording says. “You can eat tons of fiber but, if you’re not having adequate fluids, it’s going to make things even worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And remember that constipation's causes can be complicated, per Gans. "It’s important to look at the bigger picture: Regular physical activity, stress levels, medications, and overall diet all play a role in keeping digestion on track," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if you’re dealing with regular constipation and making dietary tweaks doesn’t seem to help, Cording says it’s a good idea to check in with a healthcare professional for an evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 13:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE02RjhiYml1QWFfSnU2YzJsdTY1N3ViZDYwbHlxbHhMQnF3X3piUUc4NmFSUVROUUVjemExWlhBbk5KbHRlMGF6bXl1UFlWNk41c0pTM3hBOTFhcWcySkk5WG9mZFB4dlh6elNkZFZxSFJkVkFoYW85Rmpaaw</guid></item><item><title>西雅图时报：市民科学家熬夜帮助西澳蝙蝠面对致命疾病</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/climate-lab/citizen-scientists-scan-the-skies-to-help-wa-bats-facing-a-deadly-fungus/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-content" class="article-content entry-content"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a grassy clearing at sunset, volunteers tip their gaze toward the moon. They scan the darkening skies until a frenetic flapping breaks the peace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the winged beacon of comic book fame, the tiny creature they’re here for has suddenly zigzagged into view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another shouts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bat!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this early September night, about two dozen citizen scientists have convened at Green Lake to count bats. As threats to federal research dollars mount and bats continue to face down one of the greatest wildlife disease outbreaks in North American history, understanding where they live and how they use their habitat has become increasingly urgent in Washington state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteers — retired researchers, students, folks with day jobs and people who just love bats — are playing an ever more critical role fighting for the future of bats: They’re documenting critical habitat, helping scientists with tagging and monitoring species most threatened by white-nose syndrome, a deadly fungal disease that’s wiped out millions of bats on the East Coast and &lt;a href="https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/where-is-white-nose-syndrome" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;put Washington on the map&lt;/a&gt; in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers first &lt;a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2016-03/bat-white-nose-syndrome-confirmed-washington-state-1" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;detected the disease here in 2016&lt;/a&gt; when hikers near North Bend found a sick bat with visible signs of the illness, which can include crinkly-looking wings and emaciated frames. Washington is the only Western state where researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/news/local/hanford/article292185170.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;documented mass die-offs&lt;/a&gt;. Bats with the disease or the fungus that causes it have been found in at least 25 of the state’s 39 counties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has now become a focal point for western North American scientists developing potential solutions like fungus-fighting vaccines and probiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a disease-spread standpoint, Washington is the epicenter,” in western North America, said Cori Lausen, bat conservation director at Wildlife Conservation Society Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why people love bats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bats play a vital role in our ecosystems and in human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re the main predator of nocturnal insects that threaten crops and Washington’s world-leading timber industry; nationally, bats help farmers save &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/why-are-bats-important" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; in pest control each year. When bats disappear, farmers use more insecticide. Last year, a sobering study published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg0344" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;a major research journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;made clear links between white-nose syndrome, local increases in toxic chemicals and an 8% increase in infant mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was nothing else (the researcher) could put in the model that would explain that, other than the substantial increase in pesticide use in those same counties over that same time period,” Lausen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, white-nose syndrome and other dangers like wind farms, habitat loss and climate change threaten all 14 of the state’s native bat species, said Abby Tobin, a bat biologist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. And West Coast bats are especially tough to study: Unlike species elsewhere, they don’t hibernate in big groups and are difficult to track come wintertime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re a really important case study because we have different species in the West,” said Tobin. But it’s “hard to do any kind of conservation or implement any kind of mitigation against this disease or other threats if you don’t know where they are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;“Like-minded weirdos”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To aid this work, volunteers are setting up bat boxes, &lt;a href="https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/dda6a0f6a2034c4b997ca108884a5c8c" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;reporting bat colonies&lt;/a&gt;, installing acoustic monitors that pick up bats’ echolocation calls, or spending their evenings driving around with mobile monitors. Data they collect signals where bats are active and offers a reference point to help researchers and government agencies spot red flags in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the lawn at Green Lake, a ghost of gnats swarm AJ Burgin, a volunteer with the nonprofit conservation organization Bats Northwest. “Eat the bugs that are eating me! I’m itchy!” she jokes, before turning her attention skyward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community-led events like this one are often at capacity and draw dozens of participants interested in learning about &lt;a href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/living/habitat-at-home/bat-habitats" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;protecting bat habitat&lt;/a&gt; or catching sight of these aerial acro&lt;em&gt;bats&lt;/em&gt; in the wild. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-18955190-1807784849" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":18955190,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131117.jpg?d=300x194 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131117.jpg?d=1024x662 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131117.jpg?d=768x497 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131117.jpg?d=1536x993 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131117.jpg?d=2048x1324 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131117.jpg?d=780x504 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131117.jpg?d=1020x660 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131117.jpg?d=1560x1009 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131117.jpg?d=2040x1319 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131117.jpg?d=375x243 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131117.jpg?d=780x504","caption":"Luca Bell points toward a bat as community members gather in Green Lake Park for a bat count event on Sept. 4.

Visual displays of bat calls — a series of high-pitched, synthy squeaks — appear as oscillations on her smartphone; another volunteer logs each time a bat passes in and out of view. Their reports are fed into a broader community-gathered database run by the Woodland Park Zoo and could eventually be used by conservationists to show why this area is an important zone for bat foraging, travel and access to water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve loved bats for a super long time,” says Burgin, 39, who studied original vampire mythology as part of her Ph.D. research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being able to teach like-minded weirdos to learn and then to take that learning and put it into action … that feels like research that matters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Going nocturnal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s nightfall at a gas station in Bothell, and Albert Meerscheidt, 70, is fussing with a DIY bat-detection device that has detached from his car’s roof. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meerscheidt’s homemade antenna — a broomstick attached to an acoustic monitoring device — is central to tonight’s mission: capturing bat calls along 19 miles of back roads leading toward Cottage Lake. &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Meerscheidt, a retired computer instructor, came to love bats after climbing around in caves over the past several decades. His partner Bernice Tannenbaum, 78, wrote her dissertation on bats’ social behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair are board members for Bats Northwest and are known as particularly devoted conservationists. Their attic workroom — low-ceilinged, cavelike — contains a mélange of bat monitoring gear and educational materials. A taxidermied Big Brown Bat rests inside a glass shadowbox. A plastic bat skeleton spreads hand-like wings across the top of a storage shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first summer the couple have volunteered for the relatively labor-intensive job of surveying bat activity by car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meerscheidt and Tannenbaum aren’t typically nocturnal. But to do this work they’re forced to wait until after dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the way it is with wildlife,” Tannenbaum smiles. “You have to suit their schedules!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-18955233-1038921115" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":18955233,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131759.jpg?d=300x200 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131759.jpg?d=1024x683 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131759.jpg?d=768x512 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131759.jpg?d=1536x1024 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131759.jpg?d=2048x1365 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131759.jpg?d=780x520 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131759.jpg?d=1020x680 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131759.jpg?d=1560x1040 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131759.jpg?d=2040x1360 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131759.jpg?d=375x250 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_12_131759.jpg?d=780x520","caption":"Bernice Tannenbaum and Albert Meerscheidt, of Bats Northwest, set out to log bat activity at night.

Washington’s geology doesn’t lend itself to extensive, accessible cave systems, so their domains range from urban — under bridges and roofs or inside old buildings — to wild, like small caves or dead, hollowed-out trees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby bats need lots of food to fatten up before their first hibernation season; to sustain themselves and their young, mother bats leave the roost at night to eat thousands of mosquitoes, beetles, moths and other insects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most bat species in Washington rear only one pup a year, making bat populations particularly vulnerable to diseases like white-nose syndrome, Tannenbaum says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus that causes the syndrome thrives in the exact conditions most bats seek during hibernation. When bats go dormant, their immune systems slow. It’s an energy-saving adaptation that gets them through the winter but also makes it easier for the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, to invade and irritate the bats’ skin. This itchiness has deadly consequences: Bats rouse more often, causing them to burn critical fat stores or exit hibernation months ahead of schedule. Starved and dehydrated, they’re suddenly on the hunt for food long before bug season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Bat tracking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To locate prey, bats produce sound waves at frequencies so high they’re inaudible to the human ear. With his bat detector now properly attached, Meerscheidt starts the engine and Tannenbaum hits “record” on her tablet. Specialized software slows the bat sounds to make the calls audible in real time and maps their recordings against a sound library of known species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meerscheidt flips on his hazard lights and cruises at 12 miles per hour — fast enough to avoid counting the same bat twice but slow enough to clearly capture calls … and annoy more than a few drivers along the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He takes a wrong turn down a residential street when, suddenly, two quick chirps pierce the silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And now we get a bat!” Tannenbaum says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s hopeful, she says, because she knows researchers with drive and expertise are working furiously on solutions. Passionate volunteers are collecting data that can be fed into state and national databases and “doing some things (academics) aren’t doing,” she says, to help fill in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the menace of white-nose syndrome is never far from Meerscheidt’s mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of our world has disappeared,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;“A crossroads”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test a bat for white-nose syndrome, Meg Lunnum puts on protective goggles, turns down the lights and holds a UV flashlight to its wings. The telltale sign of the infectious fungus: a bright orange glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years before the syndrome showed up here, Lunnum, 78, remembers being horrified by images from the East Coast. Piles of bats, dead from the disease. When Washington bats started getting sick, Lunnum, who runs a permitted &lt;a href="http://happyvalleybats.org/bat-rehabilitators/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;bat rescue&lt;/a&gt; in Stanwood, agreed to help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only two of 20 survived that first year. She’s had better luck since. At her bat infirmary — an 8×8 converted garden shed in her backyard — Lunnum keeps bats warm, fed, hydrated and, using tiny syringes to dispense medication, free from pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-18955195-1156251455" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":18955195,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_1_131205.jpg?d=300x195 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_1_131205.jpg?d=1024x665 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_1_131205.jpg?d=768x499 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_1_131205.jpg?d=1536x997 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_1_131205.jpg?d=2048x1329 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_1_131205.jpg?d=780x506 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_1_131205.jpg?d=1020x662 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_1_131205.jpg?d=1560x1013 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_1_131205.jpg?d=2040x1324 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_1_131205.jpg?d=375x243 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10152025_1_131205.jpg?d=780x506","caption":"Meg Lunnum outside of her Stanwood, Snohomish County, bat rescue, where she helps bats recover from white-nose syndrome.

The disease has yet to turn up in bats in western Canada and hasn’t been observed in states like Oregon and California. For the past few summers, the researchers have sprayed a probiotic dust (cultured from healthy bat skin microbes) into Washington maternity roosts; early results, Lausen says, suggest some bats are developing resilience against the fungus that causes the deadly syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“​​We’re actually at a crossroads now, like, can we keep this project afloat?” said Lausen, noting that Trump-era research cuts have thrown the project’s future grant funding into limbo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizen science has become even more critical at this moment. A vast majority of the people involved in the probiotic experiment are volunteers, Lausen said. She and her colleagues designed it this way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t possibly go treat hundreds and hundreds of bat boxes across western North America … It can be only cost effective and (practical) to hit as many roosts as possible by engaging citizens to be able to do this.” Her ultimate goal is to ship the probiotic to anyone who wants it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at the infirmary, Lunnum is treating four sick bats, including one with white-nose syndrome. Whenever she takes in a bat, she makes a point to log where they’ve come from, and once they’re well, return them home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bat with white-nose syndrome, she said, is steadily improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It looks really good,” she said. “I’m thinking it can probably be released.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The research is still in the earlier stages — it has yet to be tested in a Phase 3 clinical trial — but experts say it shows promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15bc07" class="body-graf"&gt;“I am cautiously optimistic,” said Stephanie Dougan, an associate professor of cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who was not involved with the work. “There is a scientific logic to why this could work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f47922" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers found that among &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/jimmy-carter-drug-immunotherapy-melanoma-rcna153166" target="_blank"&gt;cancer patients getting immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, those who got an mRNA Covid vaccine within 100 days before starting their treatment lived longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e80ffa" class="body-graf"&gt;Only about &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/inhealth/about-us/immunotherapy-precision-medicine-action-policy-brief" target="_blank"&gt;20% of cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; who get immunotherapy — which harnesses a person’s immune system to fight cancer cells — respond to the treatment. Finding a way to boost the effectiveness of immunotherapy drugs has been a feat researchers have been exploring for years, with little success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-85eda2" class="body-graf"&gt;Typically, the immune-stimulating tactics employed in the past have either done too little to activate the immune system or done too much, triggering an overactive response that can damage the body. There’s a chance that mRNA Covid vaccines could exist in a Goldilocks zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8f6b6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Maybe we just needed something that was medium-strong, and this could potentially be it,” said Dougan, who emphasized the need for more research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e2707" class="body-graf"&gt;That research will soon be underway: Dr. Adam Grippin, a senior resident in radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center who co-led the study, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4ae7d" class="body-graf"&gt;In the research presented Sunday, Grippin and his co-authors looked back at survival rates among more than 1,000 people who had advanced non-small cell lung cancer and got &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-patients-immunotherapy-may-way-skip-surgery-chemo-rcna203038" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; as part of their treatment from 2019 through 2023. Of those, 180 people received an mRNA Covid vaccine within 100 days of starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8fa811" class="body-graf"&gt;The median survival for the group — when exactly half of those who underwent treatment are still alive — was nearly twice as long for those who were vaccinated compared to those who were not: about three years compared to just over 1.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0d2582" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients getting immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma. Forty-three got an mRNA Covid vaccine; 167 did not. For those who didn’t get vaccinated, median survival was just over two years.

When dendritic cells detect a threat, they turn on a sort of beacon that leads T cells to the perceived invader so they can attack. However, not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of fighting tumors, which is why scientists believe immunotherapies only work in some of the cancer patients who take them. In these people, the immune system recognizes cancer cells as a threat, but their specific T cells are unable to stop the tumors from growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf9c14" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s just random chance whether you have those cells or you don’t,” said Jeff Coller, a professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-80e7fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Getting an mRNA Covid vaccine doesn’t change whether a person has the specific T cells needed to fight their tumors, but it does appear to make it more likely that dendritic cells will detect a tumor as a problem and direct the T cells a person does have to the tumor. If those cells happen to be programmed to be able to kill tumor cells, having an mRNA vaccine that lights up the target before a person starts an immunotherapy can give their immune system a boost that helps the cancer therapy work better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1d82c7" class="body-graf"&gt;Coller said one reason mRNA technology may be the best tool to elicit this response is because every cell in the body already contains mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-94efe2" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are really tapping into that natural process that your body already knows how to respond to,” he said. “You are using your body’s natural system to fight tumors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad698f" class="body-graf"&gt;Dougan said it’s possible that other factors could have accounted for better survival among people who were vaccinated prior to immunotherapy treatment. For example, a Covid infection may have weakened an unvaccinated person’s body and hindered their ability to fight off cancer cells. In the past, early studies like this one have shown promising results that didn’t pan out in later trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6e8fe" class="body-graf"&gt;“We have been misled by retrospective studies before,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c0fbff" class="body-graf"&gt;Grippin agreed the findings warrant a closer look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5eec04" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This data is exciting, but all of these findings need to be validated in Phase 3 clinical trials to determine whether these vaccines should be used in our patients,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 12:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQUFFPLURKSGxoQ2NTZ1dkRTIwaEEzSVA2dmZra21LcEI2QzExQU45YXVTdE9hN2k3aGpxbjRab0M2S2JaYm14cUw5bUtyRUEtWFJicVJuVlVBam9pYzRrT09YSGxYNFBMdkJYQ2NkcU04Y05jNDNQZXhhV281eWNfMW1oU3hWVlF5OEtKYVpzLWRjTjjSAVZBVV95cUxQMVV0OHNwOG9NanpFZTJpemZGV1BOeVpicHVneThCSzQ1U0UyVjk0clJUdXNIT1ZuLS1KcDU0eDkxWlE2TW9jVU1iZ1B4WHRwdVJCS3ljdw</guid></item><item><title>对于经历过非自愿性行为的女性，性同意往往会随着年龄的增长而下降- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/sexual-consent-tends-to-decline-with-age-for-women-who-have-experienced-nonconsensual-sex/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19419899.2025.2554708" target="_blank"&gt;Psychology &amp;amp; Sexuality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; indicates that as women with previous experiences of nonconsensual sex grow older, they tend to report lower levels of both internal willingness to engage in sexual activity and external expressions of consent. These patterns were not observed in women without such experiences or in men, regardless of their history. The findings suggest that the effects of sexual trauma on consent may be persistent and may influence how sexual agency is experienced well into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual consent is a central part of healthy sexual relationships, but its meaning and expression are not always straightforward. Most research in this area has focused on young, university-aged women, which leaves a gap in knowledge about how people of different ages and genders experience consent. The researchers aimed to address this gap by exploring whether age and a history of sexual trauma influence how people experience and express sexual consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People continue having sex beyond their 20s as well as after sexual assault. But experiences of sexual consent in these cases are critically understudied. This research takes a step toward better understanding sexual consent across the lifespan and following potentially traumatic events. Specifically, women with previous nonconsensual sexual experiences may feel less willing to engage in partnered sexual activity over time,” said study author Malachi Willis of the University of Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 658 adults living in the United States and the United Kingdom through an online platform. Participants ranged in age from young adults to older adults, with a nearly equal number of men and women. They were asked to complete a series of questionnaires about their most recent sexual experience. These included measures of how willing and ready they felt internally (internal consent) and how they communicated their willingness to their partner (external consent). Participants also indicated whether they had experienced any form of nonconsensual sexual behavior in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal consent was measured using a set of questions that assessed five aspects: physical arousal, feelings of safety and comfort, emotional readiness, desire for the activity, and a sense of agreement. External consent was measured through questions about how clearly and actively participants signaled their willingness, either through words or actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When analyzing the data, the researchers looked at how internal and external consent varied with age, gender, and history of nonconsensual experiences. Their results showed that older age was linked to lower levels of both internal and external consent, but only for women who had experienced nonconsensual sex in the past. For these women, increasing age was associated with a gradual decrease in both how willing they felt during sex and how actively they communicated that willingness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern was not found in women who had not experienced nonconsensual sex. Nor was it found in men, whether or not they had such a history. The findings were consistent across all five dimensions of internal consent and all four types of external communication, including verbal and nonverbal signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation suggested by the authors relates to trauma. Research indicates that trauma from past sexual experiences can shape later sexual encounters, making it harder for individuals to feel safe, emotionally present, or confident during sexual activity. These effects may accumulate over time, especially if the trauma is not addressed. In women, this may translate into a reduced sense of agency and less active communication of consent as they age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that for some women, verbal communication during sex may trigger memories of traumatic events. Prior studies have found that women who have experienced sexual assault may avoid explicit consent cues because they feel unsafe or emotionally overwhelmed by them. If this avoidance becomes habitual, it may contribute to long-term changes in sexual behavior and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also point to possible gender differences in how trauma affects sexual consent. While some men in the study had experienced nonconsensual sex, their reports of internal and external consent did not change with age. Other research suggests that men may be less likely to express distress related to sexual trauma or may try to suppress such experiences. These factors could help explain why no similar age-related patterns were found among men in the current study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sexual consent is more than communication,” Willis told PsyPost. “A person internally experiences levels of willingness to engage in sex with another person before they can then express that willingness to others. How people feel and ultimately communicate their sexual consent varies from one situation to the next. With this study, we supported the importance of two additional nuances of sexual consent to consider: a person’s age and whether they have been sexually assaulted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Littlejohn, a PhD candidate and the lead author of the study, added “that sexual assault and other life experiences may shape how women communicate their sexual interest; however, they do not altogether remove women’s sexual agency. Nonconsensual sexual experiences can and must be addressed to promote women’s sexual wellbeing, agency, and enjoyment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study provides new insights into how sexual trauma and age may interact to shape consent experiences, there are limitations. The researchers did not ask when the nonconsensual experiences occurred or how many such experiences a participant had. Without this information, it is difficult to determine how recent or frequent trauma might influence the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, participants reported on just one sexual experience—their most recent one—which might not reflect their usual patterns. Since consent experiences can vary depending on the partner, the context, and the nature of the activity, a single event may not tell the whole story. Memory bias could also play a role, as people may forget or misinterpret their internal states or behaviors in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research might benefit from using a longitudinal approach, tracking people over time to see how their consent behaviors change after a traumatic experience. Researchers could also explore how different types of sexual trauma affect consent, and whether trauma-informed therapy can help individuals regain a sense of control and communication in their sexual lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings do not mean that women who have been sexually assaulted necessarily desire sex less,” Willis noted. “Wanting sex and being willing to have sex are distinct concepts. These findings should not be used as evidence that men do not experience lasting effects of sexual assault. Men may report internal feelings of consent while otherwise experiencing emotional or interpersonal difficulties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19419899.2025.2554708" target="_blank"&gt;Sexual consent decreases with age for women who have experienced nonconsensual sexual activity&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jennifer Littlejohn, Mhairi Sloan, and Malachi Willis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 12:01:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxQczdJeDJrcC1rTjBjdFd3bDJxUVNmNEg1Uk9ucWpQVkJ4T1RtaTlMUUVXcVl5UFdqZU9Ic0tyZktKTjk3NlVWaEthNzk5WVJxV3YxQWY0a2t6Q2xzZkI5QklwUmlGelVseTRfV09XTU1vMURRYmdjTEp0cjJJNGFZMC1XUUtUZzcxOWZTcnltRWtZNVpjdXRlaFRvMm9PN1g5azBLV3gtUEF6emNhVFZlNmdZOUo</guid></item><item><title>失去牙齿可能是一个致命的警告，研究发现- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-your-teeth-could-be-a-deadly-warning-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;How fast we lose teeth in old age has been linked to a person's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-data-point-at-age-7-could-predict-how-long-youll-live"&gt;risk of dying&lt;/a&gt; in a comprehensive new study, emphasizing the importance of good oral health, and suggesting tooth loss could be a key indicator of other serious health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooth loss has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpor.2017.08.003"&gt;been connected&lt;/a&gt; to mortality before – generally, fewer teeth means a greater chance of an earlier death – but until now, there hasn't been any data on how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials-for-drug-that-replaces-missing-teeth-finally-underway"&gt;losing teeth&lt;/a&gt; more quickly might affect this association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get that data, a team led by researchers from Sichuan University in China looked at tooth loss in 8,073 elderly people, tracking the rate at which they lost teeth against mortality, across an average of 3.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-in-your-hair-could-make-the-ultimate-toothpaste"&gt;Something in Your Hair Could Make The Ultimate Toothpaste&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Among older adults, the risk of all-cause mortality significantly increased with a more rapid progression of tooth loss, regardless of baseline tooth count," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-025-06419-1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This relationship was still present even after adjusting for several other factors that can have an influence on health and disease, including sex, age, education level, drinking habits, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-reveals-what-happens-if-you-dont-exercise-until-the-weekend"&gt;levels of regular exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177345" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ToothLoss.jpg" alt="Tooth loss and mortality graph" class="wp-image-177345 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ToothLoss.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ToothLoss-600x406.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177345" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Faster tooth loss was linked to higher mortality rates.

Rather, health issues leading to tooth loss may also be shortening your life. So tooth loss could be used as an indicator to assess someone's overall health and mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good oral health has long been associated with better general health as well, with links to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/disturbing-new-finding-links-cognitive-decline-to-dental-hygiene"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-tooth-loss-linked-to-risk-of-fatal-heart-disease-study-finds"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; previously identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly why there is this correlation between tooth loss rates and mortality isn't clear. The researchers point towards inflammation, diet, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12418"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, and psychological distress as some of the factors that could be influencing both tooth loss rates and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to diet, for example, people with fewer teeth tend to have a less well-rounded diet because it's hard to chew; the body then gets &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00784-019-03072-y"&gt;less of the nutrition it needs&lt;/a&gt;, further exacerbating health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite these explanations suggesting an association between tooth loss and other known mortality risk factors, the exact mechanisms remain unclear and warrant further investigation," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-025-06419-1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team behind the study is keen to promote good oral health.

This could be a reliable way of keeping tabs on older people and their risk of death and disease, the study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, research into innovative ways to replace missing teeth continues to progress.

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;mRNA-based Covid vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna may have an unexpected benefit for cancer patients who undergo immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that these vaccines might boost the effects of immunotherapy drugs, perhaps by alerting the immune system and helping direct immune cells to attack tumors. That’s in addition to helping protect against Covid, which can be particularly important for cancer patients who can sometimes have weakened immune systems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that advanced cancer patients who received a Covid vaccine within 100 days before taking an immunotherapy drug during the pandemic lived longer than patients who did not, in a retrospective analysis. Researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the study at the &lt;a href="https://cslide.ctimeetingtech.com/esmo2025/attendee/confcal/show/session/345" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;European Society for Medical Oncology conference&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;

Yet, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/cib.2.4.8289"&gt;other cell types&lt;/a&gt; are known to use physically connecting bridging tubes to exchange molecules.

This is very early on in the investigation process; given that the tubes are such a new discovery, we still don't know what they naturally transport or even how often they form or function within the whole human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these tubes malfunctioning could also contribute to other diseases, so researchers are keen to learn more about the miniature bridges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adr7403"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Pickleball has quickly become huge in the United States, with &lt;a href="https://sfia.org/resources/sfias-topline-participation-report-shows-247-1-million-americans-were-active-in-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 20 million&lt;/a&gt; people playing the sport.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that popularity comes with a price. With more people on the court, pickleball-related eye injuries, including lacerations around the eye, corneal abrasions and inflamed irises, have increased. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2839640?guestAccessKey=f8bad07c-53b2-464e-87f4-721d7b62884f&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=101625" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published this week in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/em&gt; estimates that the incidence of these injuries has risen dramatically, going up by an estimated 405 cases each year from 2021 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at data from a representative population of patients in emergency departments across the U.S. to understand which pickleball players are especially vulnerable to eye injuries and how they occurred. From there, they estimated what those trends looked like on a national scale.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Given the "alarming" increase in eye injury cases, the study authors called for developing standardized guidelines for eye protection, which has been found to reduce up to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3862938/" target="_blank"&gt;90% of sports-related&lt;/a&gt; eye injuries. Other sports such as squash have mandated such guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study found that 70% of cases were in adults 50 years or older. Dr. Natasha Desai, the co-director for the Center for Women's Sports Medicine at NYU Langone, was surprised to see this finding because a large share of &lt;a href="https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=sports-injuries-statistics-90-P01650" target="_blank"&gt;sports-related injuries&lt;/a&gt; occur in young players.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Desai, who wasn't involved in this study, doesn't think the sport is necessarily getting more dangerous. "More people are playing, so there's going to be more injuries at a higher volume," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And there are a lot of ways you can get injured in pickleball, notes Dr. Corey Lacher, an ophthalmologist resident at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and the paper's lead author, including getting hit by the ball, a paddle or by falling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of people think that just because it's a wiffle ball that you're not going to get hurt," he says. But, it's still risky because "everything is very fast-paced in pickleball and you're playing on a very small court."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, getting players to wear eye protection is easier said than done, as Desai points out. It's another piece of equipment players have to purchase and bring with them. And with so many options on the market, choosing a pair can be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Players would benefit from standardized eye protection guidelines for pickleball, says Lacher. "There's $10 pickleball eye protection and there's $160. How do you know which one to buy?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you're shopping for eyewear, Lacher and Desai recommend products made of shatter-resistant polycarbonate and those that meet the American Society for Testing and Materials's &lt;a href="https://store.astm.org/f3164-19.html" target="_blank"&gt;F3164 standard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Daniel Henick, an ophthalmology resident at Yale School of Medicine and an avid pickleball player, has &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/newsroom/news-releases/detail/those-most-likely-to-suffer-pickleball-injuries-ar#:~:text=Henick%20found%20that%20the%20professional,paced%20nature%20of%20these%20games." target="_blank"&gt;been researching&lt;/a&gt; which groups of players are wearing eye protection and why the rest aren't. He says one of the most common reasons players don't use protective eyewear is that they aren't aware of the risks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Henick says that having standardized guidelines, posting them outside of courts for players to see, making eye-protection more user-friendly, and encouraging professional pickleball athletes to set an example for the influx of new players could help reduce injuries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The paper points out its limitations are having a small sample size and relying on a database that only includes emergency departments that opt in to the data collection. But Lacher sees the main takeaway from the study as bringing awareness to these injuries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Henick agrees, noting these injuries can sometimes be life-changing: "We're talking about hundreds, if not thousands, of injuries every year that could be prevented with what could be a relatively simple intervention."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;USA Pickleball did not reply to a request for comment on the study's call for eye-protection guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

These experiences may resemble symptoms of psychosis but do not typically meet clinical thresholds. However, the study also finds that this association is not explained by structural changes in a key brain network involved in salience processing. The findings point toward unique environmental influences on both cannabis use and the emergence of these unusual thoughts or perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis has become increasingly common among young people, particularly in regions where its use has been decriminalized or legalized. As the substance becomes more accessible, concerns have grown about its effects on the developing brain. Adolescence and early adulthood are sensitive periods for brain maturation, and research has suggested that cannabis exposure during this time may increase the risk of later psychotic symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to examine this link is to focus on psychotic-like experiences. These can include mild hallucinations or delusional thoughts that do not reach clinical levels but may reflect early vulnerability to mental illness. Several earlier studies have shown that people who use cannabis are more likely to report these types of experiences. However, what remains less understood is the biological pathway connecting cannabis use to these psychological effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One potential explanation involves the brain’s salience network. This network includes areas like the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex and is responsible for deciding which stimuli are worth attention. Disruptions in this network have been linked to psychosis, and cannabis has been shown to influence how it functions. The researchers set out to explore whether cannabis-related changes in the salience network could explain why young users tend to report more psychotic-like experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adolescence and early adulthood are crucial periods for both brain development and the onset of mental health problems. Cannabis consumption is prevalent among individuals in these age groups; however, its association with brain function and psychotic-like experiences is still controversial,” said study author Timothea Toulopoulou, a professor affiliated with Bilkent University, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To address this gap, we investigated the associations between cannabis consumption and the salience network, as well as its relationship with early psychosis risk factors in a substantial cohort of twins. The twin design enabled enhanced control over the co-influences of genetic and environmental factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 232 healthy adolescent twins from Turkey, aged 14 to 24. After excluding participants with missing data or daily cannabis use, the final sample consisted of 217 individuals. Of these, 62 had used cannabis recreationally but not daily, while 155 had never used it. Researchers focused on occasional use to capture early effects before long-term patterns or other substance use could complicate the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants filled out self-report questionnaires that measured their history of cannabis use and their experiences of unusual thoughts or perceptions. These included items such as feeling as though others could read their thoughts or hearing voices when no one was there. The total number of these experiences was recorded, along with a sub-score for positive symptoms, which tend to resemble hallucinations or delusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also underwent brain scans using a technique called diffusion MRI. This method allows researchers to look at how well different parts of the brain are connected. They specifically measured features related to the salience network, such as how efficiently its regions communicated and how strongly they were clustered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To simplify their analysis, the researchers grouped multiple brain connectivity features into six broader categories using a statistical technique called factor analysis. These six categories, or “factors,” captured different patterns of brain structure in the salience network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggested that cannabis use was linked to more frequent psychotic-like experiences. This association remained even after controlling for age, sex, and intelligence. Among those who had used cannabis, both the total number of psychotic-like experiences and the number of positive experiences (such as delusional thoughts or hallucinations) were higher compared to non-users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the six brain connectivity factors—the one related to the anterior cingulate cortex and insula—was also associated with psychotic-like experiences. These brain areas are known to be involved in assigning importance to internal and external stimuli, which is thought to play a role in psychotic symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One notable finding was that changes in salience network connections were consistently associated with psychotic-like episodes across several brain areas,” Toulopoulou told PsyPost. “This suggests that the salience network, rather than separate brain areas, plays a fundamental role in vulnerability. The effects we found were modest but meaningful. Even small alterations in brain connectivity during adolescence can be important over time, especially when combined with other genetic or environmental risk factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the researchers tested whether this brain factor explained the link between cannabis use and psychotic-like experiences, they found no evidence for a mediation effect. In other words, while cannabis use and this brain connectivity pattern were each separately associated with psychotic-like experiences, the connectivity pattern did not appear to be the pathway through which cannabis use exerted its influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin analysis provided additional insight. It showed that individual environmental factors, rather than genetics or shared family environment, were the main influences on both cannabis use and psychotic-like experiences. This means that even though these traits were associated, they likely developed independently within each person, shaped by their unique experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked for signs that cannabis use, brain connectivity, and psychotic-like experiences shared any genetic or environmental roots. They did not find strong evidence that these factors were connected in that way. This finding suggests that occasional cannabis use and increased psychotic-like experiences may not stem from the same underlying causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study offers useful insights, it is not without limitations. The sample size, while notable for a twin neuroimaging study, remains modest, which may reduce the power to detect more subtle effects. The reliance on self-reported cannabis use introduces the possibility of underreporting or memory errors. In addition, cannabis use was treated as a simple yes-or-no variable. This approach does not account for how often participants used cannabis, how much they used, or at what age they began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only occasional users were included in the sample, which limits the ability to generalize the findings to those who use cannabis more heavily or have developed problematic patterns of use. It is also possible that the salience network is not the only brain system involved. Future studies may benefit from examining other networks that could be affected by cannabis, such as those involved in memory or emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important limitation is the observational nature of the study. Even with the use of twin modeling, it is not possible to determine whether cannabis causes psychotic-like experiences or whether people prone to such experiences are more likely to try cannabis. Longitudinal studies that follow individuals over time are needed to clarify the direction of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan to examine how genetic risk and early-life stress interact with cannabis use and brain network development over time,” Toulopoulou said. “This study was part of a broader collaborative effort using a twin cohort, which allowed us to ask nuanced questions about brain and behavior relationships in real-world contexts. We hope it contributes to more balanced, evidence-based discussions about adolescent cannabis use and mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291725101773"&gt;The relationship between recreational cannabis use, psychotic-like experiences, and the salience network in adolescent and young adult twins&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Hande Atmaca-Turan, Didenur Şahin-Çevik, Serenay Çakar, Fulya Gökalp-Yavuz, Martijn van den Heuvel, Fruhling Rijsdijk, Francesca Filbey, and Timothea Toulopoulou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 10:13:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQSW1URmktc3dlUXNBd3UtQmZqRlhzYjFoREpnLS0wbXA4UVd6RzJwNzlsQjdITzh2VXJGZjFQUktyNHB3Q3I3VzBrNTV3X3R1OWZlRXRQbEU0a0JJTWFHSEpFbzlIbDBvZnRjUWh6VVpIdXh5blZMd2RXdm9vOTZYaVNTOUlDLVprN1VfZC1rdnYzcDB4aU9jZHlrZWFzWDRhVTRMZU85YkFVMTBqODhlQ2J3</guid></item><item><title>这两位疫苗专家说，这是你应该接种新冠疫苗和流感疫苗的时候--《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/19/covid-vaccine-flu-shot-timing/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7WUICWJJ4FFCXJFWXHEEQUTTH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Flu season is here.

All were healthy, meaning they had not been diagnosed with a cognitive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fdaec" class="body-graf"&gt;In the study, called &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04149457" target="_blank"&gt;INHANCE&lt;/a&gt; (Improving Neurological Health in Aging via Neuroplasticity-based Computerized Exercise), participants were randomly split into two groups of 46. Both groups were asked to spend 30 minutes a day doing an assigned activity on a computer or mobile device for 10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a5c8d" class="body-graf"&gt;People in the intervention group did BrainHQ exercises, while those in the control group played games designed for entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f4eae3" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers used PET, or positron emission tomography, scans and a radioactive tracer to measure acetylcholine production in participants’ brains at the beginning and end of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e018bb" class="body-graf"&gt;People in the BrainHQ group had a 2.3% increase in acetylcholine production in the anterior cingulate cortex, a part of the brain important for learning, memory, attention and executive function. Those in the control group didn’t have a significant change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6cdea6" class="body-graf"&gt;The research claims to be the first of its kind to show that brain training exercises can offset natural decline in cholinergic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c529aa" class="body-graf"&gt;Senior author Dr. Etienne de Villers-Sidani, a neurologist at &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/" target="_blank"&gt;The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital)&lt;/a&gt;, which is affiliated with McGill, said his patients often ask how they can keep their brains sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-374d9e" class="body-graf"&gt;“I’ve always believed that there are things that you can do that have a positive impact on brain health,” said de Villers-Sidani, who is also an associate professor in McGill’s department of neurology and neurosurgery. “Now I’m even more sure with what we’re seeing, that [brain training] has a profound impact on the health of key brain chemical systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-039421"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1503" data-original-width="2400"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251017-Brain-game-double-decision-medium-13e46b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251017-Brain-game-double-decision-medium-13e46b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251017-Brain-game-double-decision-medium-13e46b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251017-Brain-game-double-decision-medium-13e46b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251017-Brain-game-double-decision-medium-13e46b.jpg" alt="A still from brainHQ’s “Double Decision”."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;A still from brainHQ’s Double Decision, one of the games in the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy brainHQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc3631" class="body-graf"&gt;BrainHQ training has been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.brainhq.com/world-class-science/information-researchers/" target="_blank"&gt;more than 300 studies&lt;/a&gt;. A study published last year in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/5/532" target="_blank"&gt;Healthcare&lt;/a&gt; linked select BrainHQ exercises to faster visual processing speed in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0a2508" class="body-graf"&gt;But de Villers-Sidani wondered what biochemical changes might be involved in brain training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38eb0f" class="body-graf"&gt;“We really wanted to see how these [exercises] were changing the brain in a more fundamental way,” he said, “looking specifically at a chemical system that’s crucial for attention, memory and learning, and that also drives plasticity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e84035" class="body-graf"&gt;San Francisco-based Posit Science, the company behind BrainHQ, sponsored the INHANCE trial, which was funded by the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;, part of the National Institutes of Health. Results of the trial were published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://games.jmir.org/2025/1/e75161" target="_blank"&gt;JMIR Serious Games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b8aa14" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How acetylcholine helps you learn, remember&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d764bf" class="body-graf"&gt;When you’re learning something new, your brain is using acetylcholine. It tells your brain to stay alert. It’s key to other bodily functions, too, including &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/new-blood-pressure-drug-helps-people-uncontrolled-hypertension-trial-rcna198443" target="_blank"&gt;blood pressure regulation&lt;/a&gt; and skeletal muscle contraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1d8e2f" class="body-graf"&gt;Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter, which means it sends messages between neurons and other cells. It’s also a neuromodulator that can influence a neuron’s activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-560659" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a chemical that helps us learn and think and remember. It also helps with alertness,” said Dr. Jennifer Pauldurai, a neurologist at Inova Health System in northern Virginia, who wasn’t involved in the trial. “It’s not the only thing that goes wrong in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/dementia-risk-may-twice-high-americans-live-longer-study-finds-rcna187376" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, but it is one thing that has been shown to be deficient in many types of dementia, Alzheimer’s included.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc0ed3" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.24541" target="_blank"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that between the ages of 20 and 80, acetylcholine production decreases by about 2.5% per decade in the anterior cingulate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6929c3" class="body-graf"&gt;The INHANCE trial results are promising, Pauldurai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-455e9c" class="body-graf"&gt;“One of the first things I always say is, ‘Keep your brain active,’” she said. “We all say it, but nobody had really been able to prove or show objective changes in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-f2f143" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming doesn’t equal brain training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e2857" class="body-graf"&gt;Research on the relationship between games and puzzles and the aging brain has been mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-136865" class="body-graf"&gt;The BrainHQ exercises used in the trial are game-like, yet they’re not games, said Joaquin Anguera, an associate professor at the Weill Institute for Neurosciences at the University of California, San Francisco. He’s also the clinical director of UCSF’s &lt;a href="https://neuroscape.ucsf.edu" target="_blank"&gt;Neuroscape&lt;/a&gt; translational science center and has designed brain exercises for use in other cognitive studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-87f9bb" class="body-graf"&gt;“Games like sudoku or crossword puzzles, those are made to entertain you; they’re designed to engage you and get you excited,” said Anguera, who wasn’t involved in the trial. “Are there benefits to playing those? It depends on the study of what you’re looking for and where you’re looking to see improvements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8fc782" class="body-graf"&gt;BrainHQ exercises are adaptive, de Villers-Sidani said, meaning the levels get progressively harder the better you do and easier the worse you do. People doing such training should be “always pushed to their limit,” he said, noting that the trial exercises mimicked real-life stressors including time constraints and distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-615a82" class="body-graf"&gt;The two BrainHQ exercises studied in the trial were &lt;a href="https://www.brainhq.com/why-brainhq/about-the-brainhq-exercises/attention/double-decision" target="_blank"&gt;Double Decision&lt;/a&gt;, in which people simultaneously identified objects in the center of the screen and their peripheral vision, and &lt;a href="https://www.brainhq.com/why-brainhq/about-the-brainhq-exercises/attention/freeze-frame/" target="_blank"&gt;Freeze Frame&lt;/a&gt;, which involves the delayed distinguishing of a target image from other similar images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f78975" class="body-graf"&gt;People in the control group played Double Klondike Solitaire and Bricks Breaking Hex, in which players match hexagonal shapes of the same color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-8c7f5f"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1252" data-original-width="2400"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251017-Brain-game-freezeframe-medium-2-c9e799.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251017-Brain-game-freezeframe-medium-2-c9e799.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251017-Brain-game-freezeframe-medium-2-c9e799.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251017-Brain-game-freezeframe-medium-2-c9e799.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251017-Brain-game-freezeframe-medium-2-c9e799.jpg" alt="A still from brainHQ’s “Freeze Frame”."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;A still from BrainHQ’s Freeze Frame game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy brainHQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74edb3" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/workout-exercise-commitment-personality-study-rcna217288" target="_blank"&gt;Regularly exercising your body&lt;/a&gt; can help keep you physically healthy, and routinely flexing your cognitive muscles can boost brain health, Pauldurai said. But just as hitting the gym differs from receiving physical therapy, playing a game on your phone isn’t the same thing as training your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00d5f0" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of times we have too much fun clicking colorful buttons, and we get a reward because we beat one level or something,” she said. “That doesn’t actually challenge our brain to learn new things, to learn complex information and to apply knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-9d1c30" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could brain training help people with dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8450c" class="body-graf"&gt;The INHANCE trial had a number of notable limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86a7ed" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly 96% of participants were white, and most were well-educated and lived in the Montreal area. The various visuals used in the brain exercises may resonate differently with people of different cultural backgrounds, de Villers-Sidani said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82e28e" class="body-graf"&gt;Laura Glass Umfleet, an associate professor of neurology at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, had other concerns. Though McGill scientists handled data collection and analysis, several Posit Science researchers were involved in the trial, hinting at a bias toward BrainHQ in a market saturated with brain training companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e8e302" class="body-graf"&gt;BrainHQ offers free exercises but also promotes paid subscriptions topping out at $96 a year, which may be unaffordable for some people. The software also requires an internet-connected device and some level of tech savviness, said Umfleet, who wasn’t involved in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-941d81" class="body-graf"&gt;“Cognitive training required a daily commitment for 10 weeks,” Umfleet said in an email. “There’s no way of knowing if less intense training could be just as effective, or if more intense training has diminishing returns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11b3b6" class="body-graf"&gt;De Villers-Sidani said an NIH-funded follow-up trial will determine how people with mild cognitive impairment react to brain training exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4c4fa" class="body-graf"&gt;“You should look at your brain as a physical, medical organ,” Pauldurai said. “We still need the physical engagement.” She recommends &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/puberty-late-period-healthy-diet-chemicals-obesity-rcna204935" target="_blank"&gt;eating well&lt;/a&gt;, getting 30 minutes of physical activity a day and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/sleep-profile-sheds-light-health-lifestyle-cognition-new-study-shows-rcna235901" target="_blank"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt; seven to eight hours a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9dda86" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Take care of your medical health, take care of your mental health, make friends,” Pauldurai said. “And do fun, challenging things with your brain all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOY3lFdjRwNVlCcVQybndQRmVmTDYtT2RnV29aLTM0RVRUNk85NldGZVJ4RUNRX0ZSV29pWXF5RWR3cXMtU2FzcllHSEFfTDBTZ3kyVzA2eDZhUEU5MlEweUZ1SmR3VkpjeU5IQllKa0ljclltU01NTWVWam5qdzJBMGpCMEV2MTRONUNwWHlTaHpUeG5FQ3RBbGUxcmxNZVhN0gFWQVVfeXFMTm5WOXJSZHJtT05JVnp3bHFabFV3Z055LU93ekFEdlFoRXA1ZFZzWktTdUlsZ1ZlZkFQRGpDUXp4MTJXZHJtVzlOZzRLZndTYTlCcDdpd2c</guid></item><item><title>您的牙刷充满了细菌- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251017-why-you-might-want-to-clean-your-toothbrush-more</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kySSTS"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Hartmann sees this as less of a concern for people who do live together. "People who live together share a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/00458" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;higher proportion of the microbes&lt;/a&gt; in their mouth &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05620-1" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;than people who don't&lt;/a&gt;," she says. "I doubt this is driven by such an indirect route as storing toothbrushes close by, as opposed to the more direct route of kissing or less indirect route of sharing." (It's worth noting that dog owners will often &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/00458" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;share many of the same microbes as their pets&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Indeed, some of the viruses found on toothbrushes could in fact be working in our favour – Hartmann and her team found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiomes/articles/10.3389/frmbi.2024.1396560/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;toothbrushes host thriving communities&lt;/a&gt; of viruses known as bacteriophages, which infect bacteria rather than humans and can help to control their numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;&lt;span id="what's-the-risk?" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAro"&gt;&lt;b id="what's-the-risk?" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;What's the risk?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAro"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In most cases the risk from pathogens is small, agrees Zinn, but it could be more of a concern for those whose immune systems are compromised, meaning they are more prone to infections. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/8/9/1379" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;Zinn's research&lt;/a&gt;, along with other similar studies that have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964339721001099" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;sequenced bacterial DNA from toothbrushes&lt;/a&gt;, have found that at least some of these bacteria carry genes that make them resistant to antibiotics. This means that if they do cause infections they are harder to treat. But Zinn adds that in his study these genes were at "at relatively low levels" and so only present "a moderate concern from a public health perspective". One study of 50 toothbrushes from students in Italy, however, found all of them carried bacteria that were &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journalmrji.com/index.php/MRJI/article/view/304" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;resistant to multiple drugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Some toothbrushes come infused with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300571206001990" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;antimicrobial treatments&lt;/a&gt; that are marketed as being a way to keep the bacteria living on your brush under control. But most studies seem to indicate that these treatments &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://aap.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1902/jop.2003.74.3.312" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;do little&lt;/a&gt; to limit the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300571206001990" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;number of bacteria living on your brush&lt;/a&gt;, and may even lead to an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/mdr.2006.12.83" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;increase in antimicrobial-resistant species&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In fact, allowing your toothbrush simply to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.dentalhealthcareeoe.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/supervised-toothbrushing-guidelines-final-20.9.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;air dry at room temperature in an upright position&lt;/a&gt; after use can be a simple way of reducing the microbes living there.

But over time, as happens with many bariatric surgery patients, her weight gradually rose again. “The 'honeymoon period' ended and the demons returned,” she says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="1p0dc" data-offset-key="dreoq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dreoq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dreoq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;She tried weight‑loss injections but suffered severe side‑effects, and it seemed a second surgery would be unavoidable. “I felt hopeless after I couldn’t lose weight on my own; I was truly afraid I’d have to cut into my body again,” she says.

At worst, it might actually work.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="1p0dc" data-offset-key="e28us-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="e28us-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="e28us-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Yuval Wollhandler, 45, a male nurse and a combat medic in the army reserves, also took part in the study. “I didn’t want to have bariatric surgery. I know the statistics about weight regain, and it’s a serious procedure with significant risks,” he says. “When I heard about the study, I was excited — on the one hand, you get the benefits of the surgery, and on the other hand, you’re not in danger."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="1p0dc" data-offset-key="fa3kh-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="fa3kh-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fa3kh-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Wollhandler says he has struggled with his weight most of his life, at one point reaching 145 kg (about 320 lb). About five years ago, he began an intensive weight-loss program and lost 30 kg (66 lb), but over the past two years, the weight crept back and he reached 133 kg (293 lb).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="1p0dc" data-offset-key="51pdc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="51pdc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="51pdc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“The hypnotic surgery feels very real,” he says. “You truly feel like you’ve had surgery, so you find yourself actually sticking to the strict dietary rules that follow real surgery.” Wollhandler lost 25 kg (55 lb) in about five months. “It didn’t feel like a struggle. Even now, eight months later, some habits from the hypnosis remain, like planning all my meals for the day in advance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="1p0dc" data-offset-key="b6vao-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.BJgP006WGRxg" id="image_ArticleImageData.BJgP006WGRxg"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.BJgP006WGRxg" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/10/19/Hyf9xhJzRgx/Hyf9xhJzRgx_0_0_1280_1265_0_x-large.jpg" alt="היפנוזה במקום ניתוח בריאטרי" title="Psychologist and certified hypnotherapist Maya Mizrahi with one of the patients  (Photo: Tamar Haratz Barkai) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.BJgP006WGRxg" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/10/19/Hyf9xhJzRgx/Hyf9xhJzRgx_0_0_1280_1265_0_x-large.jpg" alt="היפנוזה במקום ניתוח בריאטרי" title="Psychologist and certified hypnotherapist Maya Mizrahi with one of the patients  (Photo: Tamar Haratz Barkai) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Psychologist and certified hypnotherapist Maya Mizrahi with one of the patients &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Tamar Haratz Barkai&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="1p0dc" data-offset-key="duafr-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="duafr-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="duafr-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“One of the major challenges in treating obesity is dissociation — a disconnect between the person and their conscious experience,” Mizrahi explains. “People eat on autopilot and are then surprised to find they’ve gained weight. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="1p0dc" data-offset-key="334cn-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="334cn-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="334cn-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"That experience often stems from a disconnection between the mind and body or between emotion and logic while eating.

Research shows that within five years, 40% to 70% of bariatric patients regain weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="1p0dc" data-offset-key="5n34v-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5n34v-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5n34v-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Mizrahi notes that while hypnosis is used in some countries as a tool for weight loss, the field remains unproven. Furthermore, existing methods rely solely on guided visualization, whereas this study includes a tangible, physical simulation in a real operating room — a combination that may enhance the placebo effect of the faux surgery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="1p0dc" data-offset-key="d3qgj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d3qgj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d3qgj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;So far, 41 participants have enrolled in the study: 19 who previously had bariatric surgery and 22 who had not undergone any surgical procedure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="1p0dc" data-offset-key="aroum-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="aroum-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="aroum-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Preliminary results show that after just three months, 35 participants (86%) had begun losing weight.

While it has an incredible ability to regenerate, everyday habits - from poor sleep and late-night meals to exposure to toxins - can add strain over time.

He explains, “It’s not invincible, and it can regrow damaged cells, but chronic injury leads to scarring that can’t be reversed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Coffee is liver medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi states that coffee isn’t just a morning pick-me-up or a fix for the afternoon slump - it can actually act as medicine for the liver. He states, “Three plus cups daily (is) linked to 40 percent lower risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Just skip the sugar and cream.” He also cautions that individual caffeine sensitivity varies, and excessive coffee intake may cause insomnia, palpitations, or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/psychiatrist-shares-how-late-night-scrolling-anxiety-and-stress-are-fueling-a-sleep-crisis-among-gen-z-101759762270680.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="anxiety"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fatty liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gastroenterologist highlights that cases of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fortis-vasant-kunj-hepatologist-warns-1-in-every-3-people-suffer-from-fatty-liver-shares-best-foods-for-liver-health-101760161645355.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fatty liver"&gt;fatty liver&lt;/a&gt; are more common than you think, even among non-drinkers. He states, “Fatty liver affects one in three adults, even non-drinkers. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is skyrocketing and often remains silent until serious damage.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Liver processes everything&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi warns that everything you swallow is processed by the liver, including your medications. He stresses, “Over-the-counter painkillers like acetaminophen in high doses can cause deadly liver damage. Always confirm the correct dosage with your doctor.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Liver and sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your sleep quality is directly linked to liver repair. The gastroenterologist explains that poor sleep can disrupt liver &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/nutritionist-shares-magic-drink-recipe-to-melt-belly-fat-faster-and-boost-metabolism-naturally-101760271069724.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="metabolism"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, hampering the organ’s ability to clear toxins effectively. He recommends getting seven to nine hours of sleep every day, without compromise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The liver clock&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Sethi, your liver has its own clock, and hence the circadian rhythm matters. He highlights, “Eating late at night stresses your liver’s natural detox cycle, increasing fat accumulation.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/19/original/liver_graphic_1760856762934.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Knowing how your liver functions is key to protecting its health.(Image generated via Google Gemini)" title="Knowing how your liver functions is key to protecting its health.(Image generated via Google Gemini)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Knowing how your liver functions is key to protecting its health.(Image generated via Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden liver killers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common household chemicals, including cleaning products, pesticides, and even some cosmetics contain toxins that the liver must filter, adding extra strain to the organ. The gastroenterologist recommends opting for natural alternatives instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gastroenterologist warns that &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-with-30-years-of-experience-shares-why-even-healthy-supplements-may-not-protect-your-heart-aspirin-101760324545123.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="supplements"&gt;supplements &lt;/a&gt;are not always safe for the liver. He explains, “Some herbal supplements and high-dose vitamins can cause liver inflammation or damage. Always check with your doctor.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The role of hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi stresses that hydration supports liver detoxification. He recommends drinking at least two to three litres of water every day because drinking enough water helps the liver flush out toxins efficiently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

But that doesn’t mean lifting weights is all you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiorespiratory fitness is also strongly linked to longevity, so it’s important to incorporate some exercises that improve your heart and lung health—like brisk walking, jogging, cycling or swimming—too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-HYovotBKuQL7ZtxD9TJHZ7" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-HYovotBKuQL7ZtxD9TJHZ7 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would always suggest getting a good mixture of cardio, strength and stretching in your routine,” says Alldis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This well-rounded approach ticks all the boxes for a strong heart, functional muscle and mobile joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-prioritize-consistency" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-prioritize-consistency"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prioritize consistency &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="2d7fc781-c5f2-4bbe-b9de-3529f3d6fd09"&gt;I asked Alldis how to split your weekly workouts if you’re new to exercise and want to follow this approach. His advice was to prioritize building a consistent habit first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think a good goal is always to aim for three days a week,” he says. “I would probably recommend just sticking with cardio or strength to begin with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve built this routine, he suggests adding 15-20 minutes of stretching to the end of your sessions to improve mobility and aid recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re on a roll with this, you can start tweaking your program to make sure it aligns with the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://odphp.health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines/current-guidelines" target="_blank" data-url="https://odphp.health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines/current-guidelines" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;national recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, which include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="4d8078aa-ba13-467b-bd88-e50f72c16dbd"&gt;&lt;li&gt;150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise every week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two additional sessions of muscle-strengthening exercise that work the major muscles of the body every week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential treatment is now moving into its first human clinical trial. If proven safe and effective, it could become a way to treat a wide range of cancers while minimizing harm to healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RAS gene plays a central role in controlling how cells grow and divide, but mutations in this gene occur in roughly one in five cancers. When mutated, RAS becomes permanently active, continually sending signals that push cells to keep growing and multiplying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the cell, RAS sits on the membrane and acts as the starting signal in a chain of growth processes. Completely shutting down RAS or the enzymes it controls has proven difficult, because these same pathways are essential for normal cell function. One of the enzymes linked to RAS, called PI3K, also helps regulate blood sugar through insulin. Blocking PI3K entirely can lead to side effects such as hyperglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, published on October 9 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the team combined chemical screening with biological testing to identify compounds that stop RAS and PI3K from interacting, while leaving normal cell activity intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Vividion Therapeutics pinpointed a set of small molecules that permanently attach to the surface of PI3K near the spot where RAS would normally bind. Using an assay created by the Crick researchers, they confirmed that these compounds successfully blocked the RAS-PI3K interaction but still allowed PI3K to perform its other roles, including those related to insulin signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Crick team and their collaborators at Vividion then tested one of the compounds in mice with RAS-mutated lung tumors. The treatment stopped tumor growth, and the researchers found no signs of elevated blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, they tried combining the new compound with one or two additional drugs that target enzymes within the same pathway. Together, the treatments produced stronger and longer-lasting tumor suppression than any of the drugs used alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists also tested the compound in mice with tumors carrying mutations in another cancer-linked gene, HER2, which is often overactive in breast cancer and also connects with PI3K. Tumor growth was again halted, even though the effect did not rely on RAS. This finding suggests that the new compound could potentially help stop the growth of a broader range of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug has now entered the first clinical trial in humans to test for safety and side effects in people with both RAS and HER2 mutations. The trial will also assess if the potential treatment is more effective in combination with other drugs targeting RAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julian Downward, Principal Group Leader of the Oncogene Biology Laboratory at the Crick, said: "Given the RAS gene is mutated across a wide range of cancers, we've been exploring how to stop it interacting with cell growth pathways for many years, but side effects have held back the development of treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our collaborative effort has overcome this challenge by targeting the PI3K and RAS interaction specifically, leaving PI3K free to bind with its other targets. It's exciting to see these clinical trials starting, highlighting the power of understanding chemistry and fundamental biology to get to something with potential to help people with cancer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This discovery is a great example of how new discovery approaches can open up completely novel ways to tackle cancer," said Matt Patricelli, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Vividion. "By designing molecules that stop RAS and PI3K from connecting, while still allowing healthy cell processes to continue, we've found a way to selectively block a key cancer growth signal. It's incredibly rewarding to see this science now progressing in the clinic, where it has the potential to make a real difference for patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
