A storm rolls in and so do throbbing heads, aching joints and mood drops. For years, this phenomenon was dismissed as imagination or coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZOTMOIOEQBGV7HA42GGRS2XU2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Now, with sharper tools and larger datasets, more researchers are taking weather-related symptoms&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;seriously. As former Agriculture Department chief meteorologist Albert Peterlin put it: “It’s not the weather.

Pavan Tankha, who leads pain recovery at the Cleveland Clinic, says chronic discomfort often worsens during weather instability. One of his patients experiences intense pain flare-ups during spring storms. “We’re observing a weather-sensitive pain phenotype,” or patients who are sensitive to atmospheric swings, Tankha says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DZ4LLJ6Z7NGD5PK5XCULRJRD5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“These effects aren’t random. They’re cumulative,” says &lt;a href="https://www.uc.edu/news/articles/legacy/healthnews/2013/01/research-ties-lightning-to-onset-of-headache-migraines.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vincent Martin&lt;/a&gt;, director of the University of Cincinnati’s Headache and Facial Pain Center. His team &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23349357/" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that lightning within 25 miles of a home increases migraine risk by 31 percent. Both rising and falling air density can provoke migraines and tension headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RLQO66XFDVBHNCQD5PVLYCZVK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A 2023 &lt;a href="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/head.14482" target="_blank"&gt;Japanese study&lt;/a&gt; using a barometric pressure-tracking app analyzed over 336,000 headache events alongside weather records. It found that pressure drops, spikes in humidity and rainfall are strongly associated with increased headaches, confirming what many long suspected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BF5TNVUBO5EBHJ2NBY4F6KHCJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Thanks to apps, symptom monitoring is getting smarter. Users log symptoms alongside atmospheric data, and the app learns their storm signature — a unique pattern of weather changes, such as rising pressure or dropping temperature, linked to how their body responds. The personalized approach is catching on in the United States. Peterlin built on that model, creating three-day &lt;a href="https://tpatw.com/" target="_blank"&gt;forecasts&lt;/a&gt; and collaborating with pharmaceutical teams on weather-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2FSMMCZPYZANZEDU44MZRG4FUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Wearable fitness and health technology products like the Apple Watch and Whoop help researchers map the body’s invisible reactions to weather in real time. According to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-024-11009-5" target="_blank"&gt;Artificial Intelligence Review&lt;/a&gt;, wearable sensors can now detect early signs of cardiovascular strain, stress and even mood instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E3KSD4DCTFC6REYAKQSAQ3FR7Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, what’s happening inside the body? As storms approach, &lt;a href="https://www.gammacore.com/how-the-weather-affects-migraine/" target="_blank"&gt;air weight&lt;/a&gt; declines and humidity rises. Pain receptors, or nerve endings in joints, muscles and tissues that detect stress, pressure or temperature shifts, send signals through the spine to the brain, where pain and emotion register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JIMZLGYYKZD7XNI3HDB5YKVH2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The receptors may fire in response to shifts in intracranial pressure sensed by the brain, sinuses and carotid arteries. “Even slight shifts disrupt balance,” says UCLA neurologist Alan Rapoport, especially for migraine sufferers. (Some &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/5005-migraine-headaches" target="_blank"&gt;12 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people in the United States, primarily women, are said to experience migraines.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V7EAW4MLZZFFLE2NCRLWQXZI4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A broader view reveals just how much these fluctuations affect us. The &lt;a href="https://www.stateofglobalair.org/" target="_blank"&gt;State of Global Air&lt;/a&gt; report connects climate-driven changes in air quality, temperature and humidity to increased health risks across systems. The bigger the change, the stronger the body’s response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EA45AMVVTVHQPGJDXILNKUXPJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I don’t need to check the forecast. I feel it in my head,” says Susan Cucchiara, a New York-based naturopathic doctor. She hydrates, walks and supplements with magnesium. “It’s about supporting your whole system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GMMFJMJ7CZEVDLMNQESXR5USAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Others echo that sentiment. Laurie Krupa, a patient of Cucchiara’s in New Jersey, says before storms, “pain would flare in my knees, hips and whole body, not just my head.” Today, she finds relief through movement, minerals and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CF27VMVAGVBJHI7KXWWJ2XR4CY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Weather can hit us hard. Cold fronts, low pressure and damp air may cause tissues to swell and joints to stiffen. The &lt;a href="https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/managing-pain/understanding-pain/best-climate-for-arthritis" target="_blank"&gt;Arthritis Foundation&lt;/a&gt; notes that many people with arthritis experience flare-ups during weather changes, particularly when humidity rises or air pressure drops. The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10120534/" target="_blank"&gt;Annals of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; linked these shifts to increased osteoarthritis pain. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8638190/" target="_blank"&gt;Animal&lt;/a&gt; research also indicates that high humidity increases inflammatory cytokines, exacerbating joint discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ANMMYC5VMVDS5ESHE5TAXBUKJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Stress, mood and inflammation all interact,” says Terence Starz,  retired professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. He notes that tools like the &lt;a href="https://www.arthritis.org/weather" target="_blank"&gt;Weather &amp;amp; Arthritis Index&lt;/a&gt; help patients anticipate and manage pain episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C7OJSLZI3RF7HA7LK3LDJHLAIQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even the brain isn’t immune. The &lt;a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP284553" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Physiology&lt;/a&gt; reports that  high altitude can alter cerebral blood flow. Changes in air density also occur in pressurized flights and incoming storms. “When air gets lighter, the brain can swell,” which contributes to headaches, says Rapoport.  Those most vulnerable usually have a family history of migraine, often compounded by insomnia, stress or hormonal shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EQRZ5QKH25B5PEL33IF4Y6SNOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Baltimore psychologist Andy Santanello offers a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22315419/" target="_blank"&gt;deeper&lt;/a&gt; insight: “Weather used to mean danger: cold, scarcity, stress. Our nervous system evolved to react.” The body still carries that ancient imprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZMX5RWQTVBCARIYSM7XB664B7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The weather-health connection isn’t new. In 1947, physician &lt;a href="https://www.abebooks.com/first-edition/Man-Weather-Sun-PETERSEN-William-F/30943145969/bd" target="_blank"&gt;William F. Petersen&lt;/a&gt; proposed that environmental stressors could cause &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5539409/" target="_blank"&gt;headaches&lt;/a&gt; — a theory once dismissed is now supported by neuroscience, real-time data and AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XCS7LC7YJBBAPPMWKJUHX3X2VU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Even Hippocrates &lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.es/es-revista-enfermedades-infecciosas-microbiologia-clinica-28-articulo-unusual-climatic-conditions-infectious-diseases-S0213005X1000114X" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about this,” says Peterlin, the former USDA meteorologist. “Now science is finally proving it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="KUVXVTF2FZGBHOMZJ6D5BEGUCE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="KUVXVTF2FZGBHOMZJ6D5BEGUCE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Help for managing symptoms&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R3UKWKLXQND6NHK6XO45QUYBIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The weather may be unpredictable, but your body can learn to move with it.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyafal004d8cm6ld8yt5dq@published"&gt;Hot dogs, bacon, pepperoni—processed meat, everyone seems to agree, isn’t good for you. A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03775-8.epdf?sharing_token=NtmRCXKzFoI0zLRCKb_GLNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P8oSmKlEdMZZ8FJC_MYA76IigYXBfYRQ7nIr3haaEP8rnybSJO1JeOvMKcgNcHeSL91YhXLxa-RKzp-9BrywDQNadvANiaMa0J7cbsxEnfLadbf7Xcx7eLUjEmerutJBUFu4-AyWPldYwj6yXVmhU849GF-1zWXM-PV7lOOPXI3w%3D%3D&amp;amp;tracking_referrer=www.cnn.com"&gt;recent study in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that belief and even took it one step further: Forget the occasional beef jerky; such snacks have no place at all in a healthy diet. The authors write that “even lower levels of habitual consumption of these dietary risk factors are not safe.” Given &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2025-07-10/experts-say-theres-no-safe-amount-of-processed-meat"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/02/health/processed-meats-sweet-drinks-disease-wellness"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-finds-no-safe-level-of-processed-meat-consumption"&gt;covering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/is-processed-meat-safe-health-risks-consumption-study/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/article-processed-meat-health-risks-type-2-diabetes-colorectal-cancer/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, you might think it wise to quickly cross the street if you so much as lay eyes on a piece of bacon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyaojx000o3b79l748jqrn@published"&gt;I’m not convinced that processed meat is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bad. Although the evidence against it is consistent, when it comes to food research, it’s still hard to draw firm conclusions about even something as well studied as processed meat.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyaolg000p3b79i9bvzshg@published"&gt;Food is one of the most complex topics in epidemiology. There are a few reasons for this. One of the big ones is that it’s very hard to measure what we eat. You have to rely mostly on study subjects reporting what they ate over the past year. People are &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; at accurately reporting their diets. The other reason is that there is no easy control group for any specific food. If you want to test whether, say, acetaminophen works, you can easily craft a placebo pill that looks exactly the same but does nothing to the body. What’s the placebo control for a hamburger? You have to eat &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, and that something will inevitably have some kind of impact on your health. Not to mention that your subjects will probably realize if they’ve been served a vegetable-based dupe of the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  




  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyaomx000q3b79rmejs6z5@published"&gt;This new study may appear robust in a couple of ways. It’s a meta-analysis, which means that the authors looked at all the studies published on a topic and combined them into one statistical model. This is, in theory, the most robust form of research, because it allows you to see the average result for a question across dozens or even hundreds of individual pieces of research.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyaoon000r3b79p5ozjsx1@published"&gt;On top of the usual meta-analysis model, the authors also performed what’s called a burden-of-proof analysis. This methodology allows them to make more specific statements about the findings. In this case, they set thresholds for associations between processed meat and various diseases that went from very weak to very strong on a five-point scale.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyaoqj000s3b79s2cknt7i@published"&gt;But after aggregating the data from dozens of studies, the researchers weren’t able to make a slam-dunk case against processed meat. The efforts showed that there was a weak (2 out of 5 on their scale) relationship between processed meat and diabetes. The association between processed meat and colorectal cancer just scraped 2 out of 5 on the scale as well, while heart disease was only very weakly (1 out of 5) associated with processed meat consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyaosg000t3b79a2aac2ya@published"&gt;The meta-analysis also looked at sugar-sweetened beverage consumption: soda, pop, soft drinks, etc. This was also weakly associated with increased risks of diabetes, cancer, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyaou4000u3b79wlsb9p5y@published"&gt;Why are all these associations so weak? The main reason is that the evidence was inconsistent. Some studies show an increased risk of even small amounts of processed meat; some don’t. Some data indicate that processed meat gives you diabetes; other data show that it’s fine. The research is scattershot simply because food studies are hard to do in an airtight way. Such studies rarely give us enough information to confidently tie together cause and effect; aggregating a bunch of flawed studies together doesn’t necessarily help all that much.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="143" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyaovq000v3b7960y3c43x@published"&gt;In addition, there is this question: &lt;em&gt;What even is “processed meat”?&lt;/em&gt; It’s a category so broad that it’s impossible to capture in a single paragraph, let alone a study in which the goal is to minimize as many variables as possible. A cheap hot dog at a baseball game and $5,000 Serrano ham are both processed meat, but they are drastically different products in terms of how they are made and who buys them to eat. The only thing the fancy smoked sausage from the farmers market and the chicken nuggets in your freezer have in common is that they are “processed,” but everything else—including the method of processing—is totally different. So when the take-home message is that processed meat is not safe in any amount, it’s worth asking: Well, &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; processed meats are we talking about? The research doesn’t get into that.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyaox6000w3b79et63m0gb@published"&gt;We have also never really identified what it is about processed meat that makes it so bad for our health. Depending on whom you ask, it is either the nitrite preservatives used in these products or the high levels of fat and salt. But there are plenty of processed meats that don’t have these things added to them, and the research showing higher associated risks doesn’t differentiate, so it’s hard to know, from a theoretical perspective, whether processed meat could even give people cancer.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyaoys000x3b79giirk17x@published"&gt;What we can say from this recent study is that the overall evidence that we’ve got across dozens of pieces of research is fairly &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt;. People who say they eat more processed meat are consistently less healthy in a variety of ways than people who say they eat less of the stuff. The extent of the negative effects, and the risk for various diseases, varies from study to study, but pull back and the evidence shows a clear trend: If you report eating a lot of processed meat, you are more likely to get diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and a whole range of other problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyap0d000y3b7918j9evd3@published"&gt;At the end of the day, it’s still difficult to know whether it’s processed meat&lt;em&gt; itself&lt;/em&gt; that is causing these issues or if there is something about the group of people who tend to buy more processed meat in high-income countries that is simply very different from everyone else. We have not properly eliminated the possibility, for example, that those who earn more money buy less processed meat and are less likely to get cancer for reasons unrelated to processed meat consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdsyap1y000z3b793yk3fz1l@published"&gt;It’s probably never going to be a good idea to gorge on bacon. If nothing else, processed meat tends to be very high in calories, due mostly to containing a lot of fat, and we know that eating too much of that is bad for you in many ways. But the idea that any hot dog consumption is inadvisable isn’t supported by strong evidence. I, for one, will keep having the occasional slice of &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;salami.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Her numbers kept creeping up. Soon, the glucose levels in her blood officially tipped into the “prediabetic” zone. When Hyman was eventually diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, at age 48, she begged her doctors to give her six more months before prescribing medication. “I was frustrated with my body, and I wanted to do something myself,” she said. But her internist refused, saying Hyman’s uncontrolled blood sugar was too precarious; without medication, the damage to her body could be severe. “I was really upset,” Hyman said. “I just didn’t fit the profile of someone with Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M4RG5BLPM5FC7DV4SQQZJFSCH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During this time, Hyman began noticing her inability to distinguish colors. She routinely asked her children whether clothes were blue or green.

It took a misdiagnosis and a handful of physicians to figure it out, and when they did, it was both terrifying and a relief for Hyman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FG2A2LXPDFBTJHW6CF3K57WJ4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“A diagnosis for people is peace of mind, even if it’s a terrible thing,” said Hyman, who is now on an experimental treatment plan that may help. “Without it, I’d still be treated like I have Type 2 diabetes, which isn’t what I have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="EBWA4E6IXJEFVFNTBDJZBPHDJI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="EBWA4E6IXJEFVFNTBDJZBPHDJI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Issues in pregnancy&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B7VC562LHBHNZI6V3C7UHSSMFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman, now 54, had never been diagnosed with any serious illness until she was pregnant with her first child, at age 31. Doctors discovered she had gestational diabetes, a condition that occurs during pregnancy, when hormones shift dramatically, and the body struggles to produce enough insulin to handle the increased blood sugar levels. After her baby was born, the condition resolved, as is often the case. The same thing happened during her second pregnancy. When Hyman was pregnant with her third child, doctors assumed she would develop gestational diabetes and ordered insulin injections to keep her blood sugar in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GVZQRLCU7ZFDXNCTAD3MLLKPBE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People with gestational diabetes are at&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9016728/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9016728/" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing Type 2 diabetes, studies show. Indeed, after her third pregnancy, Hyman’s blood sugar remained high; her A1C, a measure of glucose in the blood over several months, entered the “prediabetic” zone and stayed there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HRGZ7IZSMRCYTD4CYFOPVDPO5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For 10 years she remained vigilant, working to keep her weight steady at no more than 102 pounds on her 5-foot-2 frame. Then her blood sugar rose into “diabetic” territory; she seemed unable to control it through lifestyle alone. Eventually, she agreed to take Metformin, a standard medication for Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="65TBBU23AFCT7OKBZSWSHNKEWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman’s husband, Garrett, a sports and spine doctor specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation, said he had been suspicious about the diagnosis. “I always thought Rachel’s diabetes didn’t make sense,” he said. “She was eating better than anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="J5AJDMZ2AFBC3BL4EMCK2BWVNY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="J5AJDMZ2AFBC3BL4EMCK2BWVNY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Middle-aged color-blindness&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YEDE6A7NBHIXMFWXI4YVGX6GY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman’s vision problems worsened gradually. She recalled “seeing colors differently than other people” when she was younger. But in her 40s, the deterioration became apparent. Once, she said, she complimented a friend on a pair of “good, off-white pants,” and the friend replied, “They’re green.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LLNWJQEY5FACJIT56DQX326FUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s when she raised concerns with the ophthalmologist. An examination for color-blindness, the&lt;a href="https://www.color-blind-test.com/color-blind-tests/ishihara-test/ishihara-color-blind-test.html" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.color-blind-test.com/color-blind-tests/ishihara-test/ishihara-color-blind-test.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ishihara&lt;/a&gt; test, revealed she could not see numbers embedded in a color background that people with normal vision can easily spot. The doctor said she was “severely color deficient,” Hyman recalled. When she shared a memory of being able to see numbers on the same test taken years before, the ophthalmologist referred Hyman to a specialist, citing concerns about potential eye or brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MWT2HJKF3VFPREE6AWNZ4KQ724" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In March 2023, Hyman arrived at Swedish Hospital in Seattle for an appointment with Bonnie Keung, a neuro-ophthalmologist. After an exam, Hyman learned she had “pale optic nerves,” which indicate possible damage or an underlying condition affecting the nerves that connect the eyes to the brain. Healthy optic nerves are pinkish. Hyman’s were faded and partially white. Keung ordered genetic tests and an MRI to look for problems, like a mass in the brain. “I was scared they’d find something no one was looking for,” Hyman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="WZ6NJ7ESKVBC5CJJ534S3DFUFQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="WZ6NJ7ESKVBC5CJJ534S3DFUFQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;‘What I found looked awful’&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IIHPPMUCSNC5FNXQJK24GI3PNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman’s MRI was normal, but on viewing the genetic tests results, Keung was “truly surprised,” she recalled. “I thought she would have one of the more common inherited optic neuropathies we see. … [Hers] is a rare condition even in the world of neuro-ophthalmology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SG7PTDWD4ZB6TD7IUKBKI72UAE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman tested positive for &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24044-wolfram-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt;Wolfram syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, an incurable genetic disorder that can affect blood sugar regulation, vision and neurological health. It affects approximately &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/wolfram-syndrome/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#frequency" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 500,000 people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. In Wolfram’s classic form, patients face a bleak prognosis: childhood diabetes, optic nerve atrophy and then other debilitating symptoms, such as loss of bladder control, anxiety, depression and trouble swallowing and breathing. The median life expectancy is about 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JMLP3SDEJZFNHAOFQ7PUGXVHJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When she received the diagnosis, Hyman immediately began googling. “What I found looked awful,” she said. “This was not good, and I was scared and confused.” She thought about a first cousin, also 54, with Type 1 diabetes who is legally blind. “I wondered, ‘Was that going to be me?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZCTV4EYNENDNJJPCPNXKT5ENOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman was so distressed by what she was reading that she mistook the word “morbidity,” which refers to the impact of an illness on a population, for “mortality,” the death rate. “I’m reading about this high mortality rate and freaking out and I show my husband, ‘Oh my God, look at this,’ and he says, ‘It’s morbidity, not mortality.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UN6BSHYBIRARXNPTZANU364OHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Keung quickly arranged a telehealth meeting for Hyman with a Wolfram specialist. But the week leading up to the appointment was stressful: Hyman couldn’t concentrate and lost her appetite and her ability to enjoy activities. “You’re kind of holding your breath,” she said. “Who wants to be the person with the super rare condition? Who’s going to want to do anything to help; there’s probably no research and who knows what my future holds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="OHCB4F5CVFBZ5P56L6R5EMX34Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="OHCB4F5CVFBZ5P56L6R5EMX34Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;A milder variant?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5ZHMNSLDFVGLZBZVYMPAT3BTGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Anxious, Hyman logged on to that first meeting in August 2023 with Fumihiko Urano, a medical geneticist professor at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis who is director of the Wolfram Syndrome and Related Disorders Clinic at BJC HealthCare. The clinic is the only&lt;a href="https://wolframsyndrome.wustl.edu/" target="_blank"&gt; center&lt;/a&gt; in the United States studying and treating people with Wolfram syndrome, which is characterized by mutations in the WFS1 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NOBDJXBRURCUNO6CRRW2GQB2U4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Urano delivered some reassuring news: It appeared Hyman had a milder variant of Wolfram that mainly affects Ashkenazi Jews, whose ancestors like hers, come from Eastern or Central Europe. Researchers only started to understand the variant fairly recently, said Urano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2EYMYF2YK5F5DLPH3AMUOD3HQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Urano said that in 2015, he began noticing that a few of his Wolfram patients, who were Jewish, had milder, later-onset, less debilitating symptoms. Then, in 2018, he got a call from a Jewish genetic testing lab in Brooklyn asking about a specific mutation in the WFS1 gene that appeared among their diabetes patients. “Something clicked,” he said. “We all realized the same thing at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJRWZSXBE5DP3H3X6FV747FKIQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Urano estimates that about 3 percent of Ashkenazi Jews are carriers for the variant. Both parents must be carriers for a child to have a 25 percent chance of developing Wolfram syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5TIUIU5NRVFVJGKP7SVOUHK3ZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman’s husband, Garrett, who was tested and is not a carrier, said it’s difficult not knowing the trajectory of his wife’s condition. Although her current symptoms, including blood sugar dysregulation, vision problems and bladder issues related to Wolfram, are manageable, it’s unclear whether these and her overall neurological health might worsen. “My worry is whether Rachel will struggle with more impairments over time that lead to disability,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GCR7OFUPARF37FG4SW6KFZGCFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Today, to try to slow disease progression, Hyman takes supplements: tauroursodeoxycholic acid, or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9675478/#:~:text=This%20evidence%20suggests%20that%20a,R558C%20(Figure%203A)." target="_blank"&gt;TUDCA&lt;/a&gt;, which has shown potential benefits in animal and human cell studies, and&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38428428/" target="_blank"&gt; idebenone&lt;/a&gt;, which targets mitochondrial function, another aspect of Wolfram’s, Urano said. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7547529/#:~:text=Chemical%20chaperones,thereby%20salvaging%20remaining%20tissue%20function." target="_blank"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are underway evaluating possible&lt;a href="https://www.amylyx.com/news/amylyx-pharmaceuticals-announces-positive-long-term-results-from-phase-2-helios-clinical-trial-of-amx0035-in-people-with-wolfram-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt; treatments&lt;/a&gt;. Urano is trying to enroll 1,000 Ashkenazi Jewish patients for a trial to gain a more detailed clinical picture of the Wolfram variant that afflicts Hyman. But that has been challenging because few Ashkenazi Jews have even heard of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L3OCKJLOXZG4XBTK2O2HAOKKOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Right now, more rabbis know about Wolfram than endocrinologists,” said Irl Hirsch, an endocrinologist and professor at the University of Washington’s medical school in Seattle who is part of Hyman’s treatment team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HFXUMNPFP5H4ZNONV3IMO5XSZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hirsch prescribed the GLP-1 drug Ozempic, which is used to treat Type 2 diabetes, among other conditions, for Hyman; it’s been found to mitigate certain Wolfram-related symptoms in&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36995380/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36995380/" target="_blank"&gt;preclinical findings&lt;/a&gt;, he said, and it has returned her to the prediabetic zone. This improvement probably occurred because Hyman lost a few pounds, and these drugs may support insulin production by beta cells in the pancreas, Hirsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6SVUQO6BQNAYTFM6FOCZXUCVTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Finally receiving the correct diagnosis motivated Hyman to urge family members to get tested. Her first cousin, who is blind, tested positive and is now taking experimental supplements. Hyman’s mother and children, ages 22, 19 and 16, are also carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YNAGTX4KJJCW5CBNHB2EEJM3RA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These days Hyman and her mother are advocating for more research and education: They are building a website for people to better understand the condition and also pushing for &lt;a href="https://www.jscreen.org/product/reproductive-carrier-screen" target="_blank"&gt;Jscreen,&lt;/a&gt; a leading genetic testing company, to add this variant to its panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZLZT6ILGZFAGPN66SYXZEBOJYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Meanwhile, Hyman is not peering too far into the future. “I have a good outlook,” she said, but “life is uncertain. I don’t even know what’s going to happen when I get in the car tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J3JHX6OYDFDABO464E3R5PQN34" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Submit your solved medical mystery to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:medicalmysteries@washpost.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;medicalmysteries@washpost.com.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; No unsolved cases, please.

Since tumors are typically slow to develop, it could take decades to know what that might have done to the locals’ cancer risk. But there may be a quicker route to an answer: The residents’ dogs were also exposed, and dogs develop cancer more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EMY2CFQIQRGXRF2N2E2IU5SU3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Studying dogs and their cancers turns out to be an excellent way to learn more about cancer in people. And it’s not just that dogs and owners share exposures to many of the same environmental carcinogens. Researchers are also learning that cancers develop along remarkably similar pathways in the two species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KMTEV3THANFHLAGSKTEFVIPHRA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The faster pace at which canine cancers progress also means that researchers testing new therapies can get quicker results than with human clinical trials. This benefits scientists, dogs and their owners, proponents say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IIN7HWBN6NHIFG2C4YWO5ZJWMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Man’s best friend is man’s best biomedical friend,” says &lt;a href="https://www.breenlab.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Matthew Breen&lt;/a&gt;, a geneticist at North Carolina State University. “It’s like having a mobile BioSentinel organism that can help inform us about our own medical prospects over the next 25 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="VEORCHFRTBAWVHIODP4BHF3COA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="VEORCHFRTBAWVHIODP4BHF3COA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Dogs in the vanguard&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CEXHBIDBDBHO7HLOEUFCIQLVOE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2022/inside-brains-aging-dogs" target="_blank"&gt;biomedical bond between people and dogs&lt;/a&gt; is not new. Veterinarians have long treated canine patients with drugs developed for use in people, and doctors have relied on dogs to test therapies and procedures before deploying them in the clinic. Techniques to treat the bone cancer osteosarcoma without amputating the patient’s limb, for example, were first developed in dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WH7MFVE5JFFF7H42C7V4BDHICM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yet today this cross-fertilization is no longer an occasional benefit. Researchers are realizing that canine tumors parallel those in people so closely that dogs may be the best reference point for understanding many human cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2PC6XCQXBVGF7EMRSEH3GUEBMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One of the most important similarities between canine and human cancers is that they arise after a protracted struggle at the cellular level. Over the years, cells accumulate genetic damage that disables normal controls on cell division, and emerging tumors evolve ways to evade the immune system. So there can be many different pathways to cancer that differ from tumor to tumor — and, it turns out, even from cell to cell within a single tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WY54X6FZRBFJBBGQQQTGROOL2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Traditional lab-mouse approaches to studying cancer miss much of that heterogeneity, because the system is more artificial. Researchers typically have to implant tumors into inbred strains of mice whose immune systems have been suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OS7HL3BQDVGI7DCMANUX7AWTPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But new genetic research underscores how similar the accumulating damage is in dogs and people. In a yet-to-be-published study, &lt;a href="https://karlssonlab.org/about/people-old/elinor-karlsson/" target="_blank"&gt;Elinor Karlsson&lt;/a&gt;, a genomicist at the UMass Chan Medical School, and colleagues looked at genes from more than 15,000 human tumors of 32 different types and more than 400 canine tumors of seven different types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BZTOO43KYVHWBFKXJBMP6TCZSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The aim was to identify genetic mutations present in the cancers but not in normal cells of the same individual. Such mutations were presumably not inherited but probably represented genetic damage accumulated over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XPAWKWOBUNBEPKEJ6B56ZWTAVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That damage looked remarkably similar in the two species, Karlsson says. “Genetically, in terms of what’s driving cancers, it’s basically the same genes in dogs and humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7N4LPB2ZUFGMDICQANRKPWLA4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many of the dog tumors, for example, had mutations in genes already known to drive human cancers, such as the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, often mutated in breast and prostate cancers. Notably, mutations often occurred in or near the same locations in the genes in both species, suggesting that they may cause similar dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O2DQQ3HIERADTP27X57LBR2HBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A similar recent finding came from researchers at &lt;a href="https://fidocure.com/" target="_blank"&gt;FidoCure&lt;/a&gt;, a California-based company where scientists are investigating how tumors with specific mutations respond to human therapies. Records of 1,108 dogs with cancer showed that dogs whose tumors carried particular mutations had &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-023-00346-3" target="_blank"&gt;higher survival rates&lt;/a&gt; if they were treated with a human drug specific to that mutation. This implies that the underlying biology of the cancers may be similar in the two species, and if so, researchers ought to be able to use dogs as a test bed to develop new therapies for people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RM53FZA6VZBKFAOLWLIYMKL3MA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That has already paid off in therapies first developed in dogs that are now in clinical trials or approved for use for people, says &lt;a href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/amy-leblanc" target="_blank"&gt;Amy LeBlanc&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinary oncologist and director of the comparative oncology program at the National Cancer Institute. Examples include immunotherapies for brain cancers; viral therapy that targets lymphoma; and drug therapies against multiple myeloma, lymphoma and brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="2OFPLLPWENE4ZPC2ZNSO6L2RRM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="2OFPLLPWENE4ZPC2ZNSO6L2RRM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;A faster path to answers&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="INRHI2MGQRG3ZG5XFMEGKSAFMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because cancers progress faster in dogs, clinical trials yield results more quickly. For example, tumors often produce an unusual abundance of malformed RNA molecules. Researchers have shown, in mice, that targeting these molecules with a vaccine can delay or prevent the cancers. But testing a preventive vaccine in people wouldn’t yield results for many years, even decades — and funding agencies aren’t likely to support such a long and expensive study based solely on data from mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MZD7HOF3TJG7RGI4R7MMMLBODI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It would be an enormous leap to go from the mouse studies to some kind of gigantic, 15- or 20-year human cancer prevention study,” says &lt;a href="https://vetmedbiosci.colostate.edu/directory/member/?id=douglas-thamm-1053" target="_blank"&gt;Douglas Thamm&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinary oncologist at Colorado State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F677M57MDRBL3IDT3AYTALMG4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, Thamm and his colleagues tested the vaccine in dogs, which shrinks the timeline to just five years. All the data — from 804 dogs — have now been collected, and the researchers are analyzing them, with results expected by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZSHFC7LCXNFOZEVHQXOFZ2LT2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cancer detection techniques, too, can benefit from testing in dogs. Many golden retrievers, for example, will eventually develop a cancer of the blood vessels called hemangiosarcoma. Drugs can usually forestall the cancer’s progression, but many dogs will relapse. Karlsson and colleagues are studying whether they can detect that relapse in blood samples drawn from affected dogs, a technique known as liquid biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBQSHYGAQJGPRGUB7IGU3YJLFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The technique is still under development, but spotting early signs of relapse might allow veterinarians to abandon failing therapies and try something else more quickly, says project co-leader &lt;a href="https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/cheryl-london/about" target="_blank"&gt;Cheryl London&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinary medical oncologist and immunologist at Tufts University, who co-wrote a 2016 overview of the &lt;a href="http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/eprint/D6r8QgagpTNxXgy3TdYS/full/10.1146/annurev-animal-022114-110911" target="_blank"&gt;similarities between dog and human cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QFRVTI6EBRBJPLJ6IKLGHRRTSU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QFRVTI6EBRBJPLJ6IKLGHRRTSU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Environmental watchdogs&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="57CAHV5YCFARRH3Y3V5OIRH444" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There is another important way that dogs can benefit the study of cancer — as environmental sentinels. “Dogs live in our environment,” Breen says. “They breathe the same air, they drink the same water. The dog runs across the same herbicide-treated grass that our grandkids run over.” If those &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2019/exposome-research" target="_blank"&gt;exposures increase the risk&lt;/a&gt; of cancer in dogs, they are likely to do so in people, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T5TDMARZFNGEFKJXE3JRSCPQL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In people, exposures to environmental carcinogens might take 25 years to produce full-blown cancers, Breen says. “But the accelerated lifespan of a dog means they may only need to be exposed to it for two or three years.” That makes testing dogs a quicker way to spot the chemicals that potentially pose the greatest danger to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IFXT2VNOHNDD7G4M63BHPXXYCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Breen and colleagues were interested in environmental toxins that might contribute to bladder cancer. The team knew that in dogs, genetic damage that accumulates in cells of the bladder wall often includes a mutation called BRAF V595E, an early marker for bladder cancer. To find out which chemicals were linked to that cancer, the team identified 25 dogs with the BRAF V595E mutation. Then they sent out specially designed silicone tags for the dogs. They also sent tags to 76 dogs (matched for breed, sex and age) that lacked the mutation. Each wore the silicone for five days, during which time it absorbed chemicals from the home environment. The owners then returned the tags to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IJTEAVBHWNANNL2B4VGCA54SGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Analysis of the tags identified &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c09271" target="_blank"&gt;25 chemicals that were more abundant in the dogs&lt;/a&gt; with the mutation, and therefore carcinogen candidates. These included flame retardants, plasticizers and combustion by-products from smoking, fires and vehicle emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z2RY4G2I3BFZTCCMD2A3XLYCDY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A similar approach may help to measure the cancer risk from other environmental exposures, such as the train derailment in East Palestine. To that end, Karlsson and colleagues recently mailed silicone tags to about 75 dog owners who live near the site. If dogs exposed to chemicals in that train derailment show a higher rate of cancer-related mutations in their blood, Karlsson says, their owners might need to be monitored for an increased risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VUPUCPTEZFD7TPSISZTJ35WEP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers often reiterate the benefits of this research not just to science, but also to dog owners and their sick pets. The pets receive cancer care that their owners might not have access to otherwise, and the owners may get a little more time with their companions. “We’re not experimenting on these animals to their detriment,” Thamm says. “We’re trying to help those individuals.” That, he says, is a source of great satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O7K5QA4NUZHF3FCXJP22FZJHXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article was produced by &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Knowable magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, where a longer version of it ran.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 12:32:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9Zb3JUTnRpRVFtbldyTnZNNzdsLTFuaUJ0VVpVZ3FJT3ZBV2ZVdUNoeFdnOGtWNkw4NTBFcWY3dGxfUTdXZ0JsMHMyZUs2dzNyUU52U05Lc0I1ZHdCdWVXZ0REanJlZmotcXU3VWpuMDdiUW8xUkVN</guid></item><item><title>好莱坞明星在他的“睡房”中揭露虐待狂医生的虐待行为......因为他与中央情报局的秘密联系出现-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPRkhZUEo2Ny1ROEs3TUxSVVNON01GOC1HUWVLLUxld1JVbVNPb2FLd1RacjZTRkozbEpFMFRNRE5UMVNSS2NMbHlqSHMwRWpmdVc1bmp1a2RJWDRpS0l5WXh3NFhibzA1UklJS0NTNUp4RGUxYm9aSndRVHpwa3FTejJKWDZjTjBwSFc2UWV2Yk5tZWJOZXRmYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The darkened ward held just six patients - all young women, all fast asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The air was heavy with the funk of unwashed bodies, and filled with tortured whimpers. If these women were dreaming, they were almost certainly having nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was psychiatrist Dr William Sargant's so-called 'Sleep Room,' a sinister ward in a London hospital, where he subjected hundreds of female patients to unspeakable 'treatments.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One under his care was &lt;/span&gt;a 14-year-old girl with anorexia. Years later, she would become a world-famous actress, but she would never fully recover from the 'devil' who treated her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another was a Vogue model and self-confessed 'wild child' addicted to sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. She arrived for her treatment from New York, on a flight paid for by &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/jimi-hendrix/index.html" id="mol-3fcd3760-6d6a-11f0-b59b-ad678a14899f" class=""&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;/a&gt;, but by the time she left, she was unable to read, or make even the most basic decisions for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others came to Sargant with postpartum &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-66036c70-6d5a-11f0-b59b-ad678a14899f" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety or, in one case, were sent to the doctor for the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/crime/index.html" id="mol-726993f0-6d6d-11f0-b59b-ad678a14899f" class=""&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; of dating a boy her parents disapproved of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their stories are told - many for the first time - in the&lt;span&gt; bombshell new book by Jon Stock, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/sleep-room_9781419774478/"&gt;The Sleep Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: A Sadistic Psychiatrist and the Women Who Survived Him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And some are now asking if the sick experiments he conducted on their vulnerable young minds were funded and supported by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr William Sargant was an enthusiastic fan of lobotomies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sargant's work was based on the firm belief that all psychiatric complaints could be cured with physical treatments such as deep sleep therapy or narcosis - and he was especially enthusiastic about lobotomies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was in his Sleep Room - &lt;span&gt;Ward 5 of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-5ad9d410-6d7d-11f0-b59b-ad678a14899f"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;'s Royal Waterloo hospital - &lt;/span&gt;that he tested those theories on his powerless patients nearly 60 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He would routinely subject them to a potent cocktail of antipsychotic, sedative and antidepressant drugs - often without their own or their parents' consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This treatment regimen, sometimes endured for months at a time, rendered them unconscious for more than 20 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were woken only to be washed, fed and tortured with repeated sessions of violent electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), before being drugged back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most found their memories obliterated and emerged with little sense of who they were or why they'd been there. Many survivors feel the mental and physical scars of their abuse to this day - and some are convinced the doctor sexually assaulted them in their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sargant still features in my nightmares,' actress &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-1372700/My-electric-shock-nightmare-hands-CIAs-evil-doctor-Calendar-Girls-star-Celia-Imrie.html"&gt;Celia Imrie&lt;/a&gt; says in the book.

'The huge rubber plug jammed between her teeth; the strange, almost silent cry, like a sigh of pain, she made as her tormented body shuddered and jerked; the scent of burning hair and flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Celia Imrie starred alongside Colin Firth in the Bridget Jones franchise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Imrie described Sargant as a 'proud, incorrigible man with his hard, dark eyes'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was a terrible thing for a 14-year-old to witness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also describes the ghostly presence of the sleeping patients coming and going in the ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I can picture it so clearly,' she says. 'And, although I saw many female patients come back to the ward from there, I never saw anyone emerge from the place awake. You went in asleep and you came out asleep, and you were totally unconscious while inside.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she can't be sure she was personally treated with Sargant's 'sleep therapy,' she says, 'I must accept the very real possibility that I was.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalls the insulin shock therapy, a now widely discredited and obsolete treatment that saw patients repeatedly injected with large doses of insulin to induce daily comas over several weeks. Sargant often used it, Imrie says, as 'a precursor' to his deep sleep therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And there was the terrifying threat of lobotomy should other treatments be deemed unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was in the air, talked about openly on the ward..&lt;span&gt;. For all I know, that might have been the next treatment for me,' Imrie says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sargant was known to perform illegal lobotomies and referred patients for them as late as 1977, by which time the medical profession had largely abandoned the barbaric procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Linda Keith, another of his patients, described herself as&lt;span&gt; 'a pleasure-seeking, music-obsessed drug addict,' when her parents turned to Sargant to 'cure' her wild ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What they wanted was a tame, house-trained lapdog,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The model, who counted Rolling Stones guitarist &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-6491969/Keith-Richards-says-stopped-drinking-year-ago.html"&gt;Keith Richards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-8584421/Who-killed-Jimi-Hendrix-Fifty-years-musicians-death-PHILIP-NORMAN-tells-definitive-story.html"&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;/a&gt; among her loves, says that she can't remember being put to sleep in Ward 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Linda Keith was 'a pleasure-seeking, music-obsessed drug addict' when her parents sought out Sargant to 'cure' her wild ways&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top model, Keith dated Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones guitarist, who wrote the hit song Ruby Tuesday for her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Keith says she didn't wake up for weeks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All I know is that I didn't wake up for six weeks,' she says, recalling a room that was 'almost in complete darkness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was eerie. Silence apart from the moan of sleeping patients, as many as eight of us crammed close together,' she continues. 'It was a twilight world and I have a tinge of fear even now as I force myself to think about it – the enormous amount of ECT that I was given.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time she emerged, she says she needed help to complete the simplest of tasks, such as getting dressed or deciding what to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Most shockingly of all, I could no longer read,' she reveals. 'I recognized letters and words, but they made no sense to me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wasn't happy or unhappy – I wasn't there. It was as if my brain and personality were dead.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While visiting Sargant as an outpatient she asked him when she might read again, but he claimed not to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'No one had had as much ECT as me, so he had no frame of reference,' she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I found this horrifying, but not as much as what happened next – he actually came on to me. Tried to hug me and kiss me on the mouth.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Keith wasn't the only one to accuse Sargant of sexual impropriety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One former patient, referred to only as 'Freya,' was 22 when she was first admitted to his care after experiencing a psychotic breakdown. She says she was held in the Sleep Room for nine months - three of which she was in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sargant began by giving me drug-induced narcosis, combined with ECT and insulin coma therapy. My family wasn't allowed to visit me for the first couple of months,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When my mum finally managed to come, she said afterwards that she'd looked at the chart at the bottom of my bed and saw that I'd received well over a hundred ECT treatments in two months – almost two a day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her mother also later told her that Sargant had a habit of sending staff away for lunch and spending time with Freya alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have no recollection of any conversations with Sargant while I was in bed,' she says, 'but I do remember asking the nurses a number of times during narcosis why my genital/pelvic area was very sore and painful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was only later, when I was made to go and see Sargant in Harley Street and he repeatedly attempted to take advantage of me, that I began to wonder whether those symptoms were due to abuse that he had perpetrated - and ensured I couldn't remember.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sargant's influence spread far beyond Britain. He was a regular lecturer in the United States, where he was a visiting professor at Duke University, and a trusted colleague of fellow physician Walter Freeman, another enthusiastic proponent of lobotomies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was Freeman who, assisted by Dr James Watts, performed the catastrophic prefrontal lobotomy on John F Kennedy's older sister, Rosemary, in November 1941.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The procedure left the 23-year-old &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14886455/Carolyn-Bessette-Kennedy-JFK-Jr-snub.html"&gt;Kennedy &lt;/a&gt;sibling with the mental capacity of a two-year-old and she remained institutionalized until her death in 2005 at age 86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sargant's influence spread far beyond Britain - he was a regular lecturer in the United States, where he was a visiting professor at Duke University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rosemary Kennedy was 23 when a frontal lobotomy left her with the mental capacity of a two-year-old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some former patients also question whether Sargant's influence in the US extended further - asking if their treatment was funded by the CIA as part of its investigation into methods of brainwashing and mind control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one classified report from October 1951, seen by the author, the British psychiatrist was singled out as someone who 'could be trusted by the US intelligence community to safely 'join forces' on a top-secret project to control and influence human behavior.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That project became the infamous &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14810277/CIA-plan-assassins-project-94-mkultra.html"&gt;MKUltra &lt;/a&gt;which was found to have dosed people with LSD without their knowledge in an attempt to reprogram their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sargant's former patients tell Stock that MKUltra bore a striking resemblance to the treatment they endured - and allege that the Sleep Room might have been 'psychiatric experiment' funded bythe government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anne White, another of Sargant's patients, says, 'I was particularly shocked by the similarities between what the CIA had done to innocent members of the American public and the medical treatment that we'd been subjected to in the Sleep Room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Reading about MKUltra brought it all back to me: the drugs, the ECT, lying there on Ward 5 for days on end in a distressing, semi-awake state, deprived of all senses. To me the whole thing suddenly slotted together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sargant died in 1988, but Keith still sometimes wonders what she'd say to him if she were to see him in again. Though, she says, it would likely be the same as what she uttered to his face years ago in a street encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'He thought he was being very friendly and that I'd be thrilled to see him, but I called him a monster – to his face. I said it to the person walking past me too. 'This man is a monster.' And then I walked on.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The Sleep Room: A Sadistic Psychiatrist and the Women Who Survived Him by Jon Stock is published by Abrams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 12:13:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPRkhZUEo2Ny1ROEs3TUxSVVNON01GOC1HUWVLLUxld1JVbVNPb2FLd1RacjZTRkozbEpFMFRNRE5UMVNSS2NMbHlqSHMwRWpmdVc1bmp1a2RJWDRpS0l5WXh3NFhibzA1UklJS0NTNUp4RGUxYm9aSndRVHpwa3FTejJKWDZjTjBwSFc2UWV2Yk5tZWJOZXRmYw</guid></item><item><title>一位妈妈觉得自己“经常在热腾腾的乐高积木床上行走。“花了几个月的时间才了解原因。- CBS新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOdHVpUWhlT0l3VHZQeU05aU5CWk15S2p1R3pHWGFQbXhjS1NCMVdFX1BWWU43MEdUZ19RUjRiRjQ3OXVDZ3RraTJ6U2owejM0Z3pYcHBaZkpaT25CUFVWU25JZnItT0RSaWVCS3hOSlJHZDFZbFdDTlh4RFhTN3pXUkJrS0VtYXZySGEyd0xB0gGTAUFVX3lxTE1XN3ZvUFlvT2xoS0x5WTZUd2M2a2d2TnhNc3haRzQ5alZHcGdYa0VMVjlWeGlHRnVxalRqZGxYZWtDcVpKYjUtRjZXMVJ2OEV0QTJVa25SMlo5X0wySHlZbDVhTUpreTM1UGNRMWIzT2hyRHMzNFctNmtuVk9YdkJHSjJnaUpTVUlwX25FUGk3UFA0UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Amber Meade twisted her ankle and broke a bone in her foot, she expected recovery to be easy. She needed surgery to shave down the damaged bone and make sure the nerves and tendons in her foot were where they should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure seemed to go smoothly, but in the weeks that followed, she began to feel debilitating pain. A second surgery found that a screw placed in her foot had been pressing on the head of one of her nerves. That screw was moved, and a nerve decompression was performed but the pain didn't stop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would just turn black and blue, swell up really big, and I just was unable to put any weight on it," 41-year-old Meade said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain upended everything. She left her job as a surgical assistant since she could no longer stand for long periods. She was unable to take part in family activities with her two young sons. Even light breezes could trigger the pain. Resting under a blanket was unbearable, making sleep difficult. Meade compared the sensation to "walking on a hot bed of Legos constantly, while getting stabbed with a pencil." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meade spent months seeing different specialists. Finally, after nearly a year, a doctor suggested Meade might have something called chronic regional pain syndrome. It was the first time Meade had heard of it. It would take even longer before she could find a treatment that helped her pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is chronic regional pain syndrome? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic regional pain syndrome, or CRPS, is a chronic disorder with no cure, said Dr. Rohan Jotwani, an interventional pain specialist and anesthesiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine. Jotwani was not involved in Meade's care. CRPS can occur after surgery, like Meade's, or from other injuries to the nerve. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For some patients, they'll have an injury to a nerve and it will get better with time. For some patients, that injury will actually develop into its own chronic pain disorder," Jotwani said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing the condition is difficult, Jotwani said. No test or scan can definitively identify it, and because it is a rare condition, many doctors may not be familiar with it, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicians have to rely on clinical criteria. Telltale hallmarks for the condition are extreme levels of pain at the source, even when nothing should be causing it - like when a bedsheet causes pain, as Meade experienced. CRPS patients may also experience swelling, changes in temperature and skin color or texture changes. They may even begin to lose function in the affected area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing chronic regional pain syndrome is only the start, Jotwani said. Actually treating the condition requires a "multi-pronged approach" that can vary from person to person. Treatment typically starts with physical therapy. Patients may also take medication to decrease nerve signals in the area, so they feel less pain, or try &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/spinal-cord-stimulator-offers-drug-free-alternative-for-chronic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;interventional techniques&lt;/a&gt; like a nerve block. Meade tried multiple options, but nothing was improving her pain. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Doing regular therapies was not working. I even heard, at 33, that I was getting older and that 'sometimes we just hurt more.' I thought that was comical," Meade said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating chronic regional pain syndrome &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, long after Meade's pain started, a doctor suggested she see physical therapist Dr. Anita Davis, who specializes in treating the condition and leads the comprehensive pain rehabilitation program at Brooks Rehabilitation in Florida. The pair worked to develop a physical therapy routine that would work for Meade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before me, she had all of the traditional exercises ... and those things were just not possible with that much pain in her foot," Davis said. "As healthcare providers, we ask patients to rate the pain from zero to 10. These folks are typically going to be at the top of the scale, even on a good day. When I ask her to do something that's painful on top of her existing pain, it's just crazy to think about doing that." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also worked on relaxation and emotional exercises to cope with the mental load of the constant pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pain management for Amber ... isn't just the physical aspects," Davis explained. "Anything that enhances relaxing the nervous system is valuable." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol led to some improvements for Meade, but while CRPS patients can have "symptoms subside for a length of time," it is "a lifelong condition," Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's not a cure for it," Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working towards a less painful future  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meade said she still feels pain and discomfort, and is at risk of flare-ups when the weather changes or if she steps the wrong way. In addition to working with Davis, she is taking medication and receiving ketamine infusions every few months. She said the combination of ketamine treatment and physical therapy allows her to "do a lot more than I have been able to." The effects of the infusion usually last around four weeks. Meade uses that period to work on strengthening her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I try to make some headway in my physical health before that starts going down, because I know it's going to," Meade said. "The pain is a lot less when my physical health is better." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meade said even without the effects of the infusions, she is dealing with less pain than before her diagnosis and treatment. She can focus on her day-to-day activities. She sleeps better and can walk on the beach, one of her favorite activities. She can't do too much running around with her kids, but she can play catch and help with homework most days. Meade said she hopes to improve her functionality and eventually go back to work and be more active, but for now, she is grateful for what she has gained.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to try to get to that point where I have less and less flares, and get up to doing what everybody enjoys doing: Working, coming home, having something to work towards, going on vacations," Meade said. "Every time I have a good day, we work a little bit harder." &lt;/p&gt;

Easing your eye strain can improve your overall eye health as you age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As people age, they will experience presbyopia, leading to the potential need for procedures like Monovision LASIK or PRK, where one eye is corrected for distance vision while the other is left mildly nearsighted or uncorrected,” Faktorovich added. “Other procedures to help presbyopia may be lens replacement surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t put off eye exams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I never forget to have my eyes examined at least every year to year and a half,” McLaughlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s particularly important to keep up with your regular appointments, including dilated eye exams, if you have a condition that puts your eye health at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those diagnosed with diabetes are at increased risk of developing retinopathy,” noted &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/barbara-mihalik-od-56097" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Barbara Mihalik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="688bcabce4b0f5cda4870789" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/barbara-mihalik-od-56097" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Barbara Mihalik&lt;/a&gt;, an optometrist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “This starts as bleeding within the retina and can progress to swelling within the retina, cataracts, glaucoma, and development of new leaky blood vessels that can cause sudden loss of vision and lead to retinal detachment which can cause permanent vision loss. Often those affected do not have any visual problems so it’s important to get dilated at least once a year to monitor for this since there are treatments to prevent this vision loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t ignore a sudden vision change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would never ignore a sudden onset of a shower of floaters ― spots in the vision ― and flashing lights, especially if accompanied by a curtain crossing the vision,” Mihalik said. “All of these can be a warning sign of a retinal tear, break or hole that can lead to a retinal detachment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If caught early, this problem can be treated before the retina detaches, she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the retina does detach, it then requires surgical treatment and the level of vision that can be restored depends on how much and for how long the retina was detached,” Mihalik explained. “If you ever do develop new onset floaters and flashing lights, call your eye care provider right away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: LaylaBird via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;LaylaBird via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's important to reach out to an eye doctor ASAP if you notice any sudden vision changes or other eye problems.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t leave makeup on overnight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Under-lubricating the eyes is an often overlooked part of symptomatic eye issues, especially in people who use contact lenses or makeup,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/avnish-a-deobhakta" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Avnish Deobhakta" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="688bcabce4b0f5cda4870789" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/avnish-a-deobhakta" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Avnish Deobhakta&lt;/a&gt;, an ophthalmologist at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai. “A major change that occurs as we age is that we do not make adequate quality tears ― this is particularly problematic for people who use contact lenses, which are placed directly on the surface of cornea, or certain forms of makeup on the eyelids, which often disrupt tear production.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that the cornea requires constant lubrication to function effectively, and both the aging process and use of contact lenses and makeup can reduce the body’s natural lubrication ability. In addition to avoiding sleeping in contacts, he urged makeup-wearers to thoroughly wash it off before going to bed. Failing to remove your makeup can lead to eye infections and adversely impact your eye lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One way to help deal with [under-lubrication] is to use preservative free artificial tears as a matter of routine,” Avnish added. “These artificial tears are made with substances that help lubricate the surface of the eye. However, importantly, they do not have preservatives, which can sometimes cause side effects. We often advocate using them three to four times a day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t stare at the sun.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People should never look directly at the sun,” Faktorovich said. “Earlier this year, we witnessed a solar eclipse where many people were tempted to look at the sun through regular sunglasses or homemade sunglasses, which can be extremely detrimental to the eye. Staring directly at the sun without the right eye protection for even a short time can permanently damage your retina, the layer of tissue in the back of your eye that converts light to electrical signals for the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event of a solar eclipse, she recommended using the proper protection to avoid retinal burn and other serious eye damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t smoke or vape.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smoking and vaping are some of the worst activities that one can do for both one’s general health, especially for the eyes,” Deobhakta said. “There are very severe diseases that destroy the parts of the eye that are irreplaceable, such as the retina, which occur much more often in people who smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that smoking is also associated with increased rates of cataract formation, which leads to a clouding of the lens and often requires surgery to remove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, the fumes themselves can cause damage to the surface of the eye, causing corneal abrasions and extremely painful dry eye, often requiring lifelong treatment to address,” Deobhakta said. “In other words, avoid smoking and vaping if you want a lifetime of healthy eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t rinse contact lenses in tap water.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mihalik noted that she would never use tap water to rinse contact lenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a high risk of developing microbial keratitis, otherwise known as a corneal ulcer, that can lead to permanent blindness and in some cases corneal transplant,” she noted. “Instead, always rinse and store in contact lens solution, replace your case regularly, and replace lenses as directed by your eye care provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to storing and lubricating your contact lenses improperly, using the same pair for longer than recommended can lead to eye health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I never forget to discard my contact lenses in the prescribed time period,” McLaughlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t eat an unbalanced diet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

However, those studies included people who underwent bariatric surgery, while the new Kaiser study excluded people in that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="CONCERT1" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that diabetes remission is possible even outside of bariatric surgery, or outside of tightly controlled clinical trials,” said Luis Rodriguez, a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and the study’s senior author. “This is a hopeful message because we know remission isn’t limited only to intensive interventions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published Wednesday in Diabetes Care, included about 560,000 adults with Type 2 diabetes in Hawaii, California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan between 2014 and 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that about 16,000 adults, or roughly 3% of the study participants, went into remission after they stopped taking glucose-lowering medications. Most people in the study took Metformin, a common diabetes drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger people, aged 18 to 29, were more likely to go into remission than adults 75 and older. People who were diagnosed with diabetes more recently — those who had the disease for less than a year, compared to those who had it for four or more years — were also more likely to achieve remission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study defined remission as having a hemoglobin A1c of less than 6.5% for at least three months after stopping glucose-lowering medications. A1c is a blood test that measures the average level of blood sugar of the past three months. Anything below 5.7% is considered normal, 5.7% to 6.4% is prediabetic, and 6.5% or higher is diabetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who started with a lower baseline A1c, 7% or lower, were more likely to go into remission compared to those with a higher baseline A1c, 11% or higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not examine exactly how people achieved remission, such as how they changed their diet and exercise habits. But remission is achieved primarily through weight loss, so patients who went into remission mostly did it by losing weight via modifications to diet and lifestyle, Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the participants who achieved remission, 57% lost at least 3% of their body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research empowers patients who have Type 2 diabetes because it offers them hope and motivation, especially patients who are in early stages of Type 2 diabetes,” Rodriguez said. “It allows them to know that the earlier they act, the better the chances of achieving remission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, remission was hard to sustain. About 37% of people who initially went into remission had to go back on medication over the subsequent three years, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very small number of people in the study were taking GLP-1 receptor agonists, the class of drugs that includes Ozempic. This is mostly because the study stopped enrolling participants in mid-2020, before these drugs became more accessible and popular. GLP-1 drugs were approved about 20 years ago for Type 2 diabetes, but only in the last few years became more widely used for weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the few study participants who were on weight loss drugs were less likely to achieve remission, probably because these medications are often used by patients with more complex or severe cases of diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to determine whether remission should be the goal, and whether it is better than managing diabetes through medication. But preliminary studies and patients’ experiences suggest that remission means lower risk for long-term diabetes complications like heart disease, kidney disease and premature mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study doesn’t suggest that diabetes is easy to reverse, but it does show that with the right support and timely interventions, some patients can achieve remission,” Rodriguez said. “We hope this research can spark more conversations with patients and providers about remission as a goal, not just diabetes management. We also hope it encourages further studies into how to make remission more achievable for more patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>sfchronicle.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 11:00:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPS0FLUWQwRVlBeWlpeUNETk5nUWZKb2VsdGZEeW9TNWpRX0Jsa2JWbm9WMHF3MVE1U0w4SkRxbDNvZ0xrMWhmVmZIUEJ5TmdvSTJPTlBidUFfNHlIZVRXdlJXSUNpVnRaLWdhZDhHcUUxWEFyVmNmTjcwTzhfMHpTTndR</guid></item><item><title>想降低胆固醇？专家一致认为，这是排名第一的限制- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPTzhPb1dQTndncjk3aE03bjM3VE9mU05NUzRLZmpNV0VobmRJd0lJVF9XbDFENUZLX28tdUVPWkRIdHByMVJVMmw1aDJvYzlsMF9JN0o5Z2ZkckltQThGWHlHMndkeHJNdS03LXFybHJHY29oWlZMVE5fVWg5XzhXZA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number one nutrient to avoid if you have high cholesterol is saturated fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saturated fats are in foods such as meats, butter, cheese and fried foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try adding more fiber, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats to lower your cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An estimated 25 million Americans are living with high cholesterol—making it one of the most common chronic conditions in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; At the same time, two-thirds of us eat too much saturated fat (experts recommend a max of 10% of daily calories).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Spoiler: These stats are not a coincidence. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "There are genetic factors that can cause high cholesterol, but what has been understood more and more is that high saturated fat intake in general is correlated with elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels," says &lt;a href="https://www.bidmc.org/research/research-by-department/medicine/general-medicine-research/research-faculty/stephen-juraschek-md-phd" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Stephen Juraschek, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a clinician investigator at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He adds that there is good evidence that lifestyle factors, like dietary changes, can help lower those levels for many people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So let’s take a look at what the research says about the link between cholesterol and saturated fat, and the eating tweaks that may help bring your numbers down.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-cholesterol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Is Cholesterol? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cholesterol might sound like a bad thing, but this fatty substance actually plays an important role in your body. In addition to supporting digestion, cholesterol aids in the production of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/2024-vitamin-d-recommendations-8659678" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; and sex hormones. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your liver naturally produces around 80% of your body’s cholesterol. Of course, you can also get cholesterol from food. But research has shown that dietary cholesterol isn’t the same as blood cholesterol, says nutritionist &lt;a href="https://bonnietaubdix.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Bonnie Taub-Dix, M.A., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;—meaning that foods high in cholesterol don’t directly boost your blood cholesterol levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are two main types of cholesterol:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LDL (low-density lipoprotein)&lt;/strong&gt; is what’s known as "bad" cholesterol. It has a waxy consistency that can stick to the walls of your arteries. Over time, if you have too much LDL circulating in your blood, it can clog your arteries and up your risk for heart disease, stroke and other diseases, says Juraschek.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDL (high-density lipoprotein) &lt;/strong&gt;is the "good" type of cholesterol. That’s because it helps eliminate excess cholesterol from your bloodstream—specifically, it ferries it to your liver, which breaks it down and gets rid of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have been diagnosed with high cholesterol, it typically means that your LDL levels are too high and your HDL levels are low. A cholesterol test will also screen for a type of fat called &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035440/what-causes-high-triglycerides/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;triglycerides&lt;/a&gt;. While triglycerides are not a type of cholesterol, high levels may also adversely impact your arteries and raise your risk for a host of conditions, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes. You get triglycerides from the foods you eat—especially when you consume more calories than your body needs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-1-thing-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-cholesterol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The #1 Thing to Avoid If You Have High Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’ve (more than) hinted at it already, but the biggest thing to avoid if you have high cholesterol is eating too much saturated fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Heart Association recommends limiting your saturated fat intake to no more than 6% of your total daily calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That means if you need around 2,000 calories a day, no more than 120 of them should come from saturated fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7899866/top-sources-of-saturated-fat-in-our-diets/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;top sources&lt;/a&gt; of saturated fat include red meat, cheese, butter, baked goods and fried foods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Does that mean you need to completely skip the quesadillas and steak frites if you have high cholesterol? No. But as with most things in life, it’s about moderation—focusing on making &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912602/foods-to-boost-your-good-cholesterol/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy food choices&lt;/a&gt; and enjoying those high-sat-fat foods sparingly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Juraschek notes that dietary changes might not be as effective if you’re genetically prone to high cholesterol, and that’s hard to know unless you have a genetic test. In all cases, cholesterol-lowering medication may be recommended in addition to lifestyle changes. However, for many, diet is a great place to start or can complement your current therapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What specific moves can you make to lower your cholesterol? Here are four key ones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-eat-for-better-cholesterol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Eat for Better Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating to improve your cholesterol levels is as easy as simple swaps and additions to your diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Add Healthy Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Swapping some of the saturated fat in your diet with healthy fats—like those from avocados, almonds, and fish like salmon that contain omega-3-fatty acids—can have a positive impact on your cholesterol levels," says Taub-Dix. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, research has found that eating less saturated fat can decrease the risk of cardiovascular events by 17%. What’s more, replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat (like the kind found in nuts, seeds and fish) has been linked to a 21% lower risk of cardiovascular events.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The low-saturated-fat &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058981/ultimate-mediterranean-diet-shopping-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet &lt;/a&gt;has also been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol and bump up HDL levels—a big reason for its heart-health benefits. This style of eating, which emphasizes healthy fats like olive oil as well as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and fish, is linked to a lower incidence of heart attacks, strokes and deaths due to cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "I like to think about this as the things that people can &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; to their diet versus the things they should ditch," says Taub-Dix. "But by increasing your intake of healthy fats, it will naturally crowd out some of the ones that aren’t so good."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Load Up on Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, load up on foods rich in &lt;em&gt;soluble&lt;/em&gt; fiber, like apples, broccoli, beans, chickpeas and lentils. This specific type of fiber latches onto excess cholesterol in the gut and then eliminates it from your body when you poop. The result, in many cases: lower cholesterol. In fact, research shows that fiber can help decrease your risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taub-Dix adds that for those with a genetic predisposition for high cholesterol, getting enough soluble fiber could be particularly beneficial. Aiming for 25 to 30 grams of total fiber each day should deliver the amount of soluble fiber needed. Bonus: Because fiber boosts satiety, it can help with weight control—and that may also keep cholesterol levels down.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "A plant-based diet has been shown to help reduce cholesterol levels," says Taub-Dix. That doesn’t mean you need to become a vegetarian or vegan. The point is to fill half of your plate with fruits and veggies, a quarter with whole grains (there’s that fiber) and the other quarter with lean protein—whether that means fish, chicken breast, tofu or beans.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Making dietary changes isn't always a substitute for medication to control high blood pressure, but it can help a lot of people. "I’ll give you an example from my own life," says Taub-Dix. "Many of my family members are on cholesterol-lowering medications—so for me there’s a big genetic predisposition there. High cholesterol and heart disease are basically knocking at my door, but I’m not putting out the welcome mat. I’ve been able to keep my cholesterol in check by eating plenty of whole grains, healthy fats, fish, beans and veggies—and limiting saturated fats, like meat. It’s not about a total diet overhaul, but small changes can really make a difference."&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;At 57, two-time Super Bowl champion Deion Sanders, has a brand-new bladder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The University of Colorado coach recently underwent reconstructive surgery to treat an aggressive form of bladder cancer after doctors discovered a tumor this spring.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The procedure, called neobladder reconstruction, uses tissue from the patient's own small intestine. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Here's how it's done:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First surgeons remove the old bladder. Then they cut out about a foot and a half from the ileum, the end section of the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then the surgeon cuts down one side of the segment of intestine so that it lays flat like a sheet. Next, they fold it in half, top to bottom, and then connect the back part to the front.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The end result resembles a volleyball covered in sutures, said Dr. Max Kates, codirector of the Greenberg Bladder Cancer Institute at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Finally, the surgeon sews the neobladder to the kidneys and urethra.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The human body's ability to adapt to such a procedure is "amazing," says Sanders' surgeon, Dr. Janet Kukreja, director of urologic oncology at the University of Colorado Cancer Center. Patients usually spend just a few days recovering in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She performed Sanders' neobladder reconstruction robotically and with a laparoscopic camera, a method that only requires small incisions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kukreja told NPR that a cool aspect of this surgery is that because the neobladder is created from the body's own tissue, a patient's immune system doesn't reject the new organ. So patients with neobladders don't need immunosuppressant medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Plastic wouldn't work either to reconstruct a bladder since the urinary tract rejects foreign materials, said Kukreja. Calcium would build up giving patients bladder stones.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A reconstructed bladder doesn't function exactly like someone's original bladder because it can't send signals to the brain to let a person know when to use the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Getting used to a neobladder takes some training, says Dr. Jodi Maranchie, a surgical urologic oncologist at UPMC in Pittsburgh. Gradually they increase the interval between bathroom visits until they can comfortably control their bladder during the day. But leakage often remains an issue for people while they sleep.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;During a Monday &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/B2TXLKzLShQ" target="_blank"&gt;press conference,&lt;/a&gt; Sanders acknowledged this drawback. He joked that, like his one-year-old grandson, he now "depends on the Depends."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I know there's a lot of people out there going through what I'm going through. And dealing with what I'm dealing with," he said. "And let's stop being ashamed of it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kates said a lot of people do feel shame around the incontinence that comes with a neobladder reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Which is why Kates told NPR that he "loved every moment" of Sanders' press conference. The urologist described the Pro Football Hall of Famer as authentic and funny, "the guy was anything but shameful."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact two of Kates' patients, both men around Sanders' age, mentioned the press conference: "They both felt completely validated by him."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An estimated 85,000 people in the U.S., will get bladder cancer this year, according to data from the American Cancer Society. While most patients with bladder cancer are men, Maranchie said that women tend to present with a more advanced and slightly more aggressive disease. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because the only symptom of bladder cancer is blood in urine, she theorized that some women mistake this warning sign for menstrual blood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Sanders shared that his tumor was discovered during an annual checkup.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He said if he hadn't gone in for that appointment, things might have turned out very differently.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Please get yourself checked out," he said. "Because if it wasn't for me getting tested for something else they wouldn't have stumbled up on this. Make sure you get the right care."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;metallic ring weighing over 1,100 pounds&lt;/strong&gt; crash-landed in Kenya just before New Year’s Eve, sending shockwaves—literal and figurative—through the small community of &lt;strong&gt;Mukuku&lt;/strong&gt;, about 115 kilometers southeast of Nairobi. Experts from the &lt;strong&gt;Kenya Space Agency (KSA)&lt;/strong&gt; later confirmed the object was a separation ring from a &lt;strong&gt;space launch vehicle&lt;/strong&gt;, raising urgent questions about the growing problem of space debris orbiting Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Terrifying Crash and a Community on Edge&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to eyewitness accounts gathered by the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn9dgdwe3o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BBC’s Waihiga Mwaura&lt;/a&gt;, residents first heard “a loud whizzing sound followed by a boom,” described by 75-year-old farmer Stephen Mangoka as “like a bomb going off.” The object, about &lt;strong&gt;8 feet (2.44 meters)&lt;/strong&gt; in diameter, landed on farmland near a dry riverbed and was red-hot for nearly two hours before villagers could approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crowds gathered quickly, drawn by &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/nasas-curiosity-rover-makes-an-unprecedented-discovery-on-mars/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83883" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;curiosity &lt;/a&gt;and fear, taking photos and speculating whether it was part of a rocket, a satellite, or something more sinister. Fearing scrap metal thieves might target the ring, villagers took turns guarding it overnight with local officials. By the next day, &lt;strong&gt;KSA teams&lt;/strong&gt; had secured the object and transported it for testing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="A crowd, including police officers, stand behind yellow tape looking on at a giant metal ring which fell from space on to farmland in Mukuku, Kenya " data-lazy-src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58aa/live/ed0ee1f0-cf7a-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg.webp"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58aa/live/ed0ee1f0-cf7a-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg.webp" alt="A crowd, including police officers, stand behind yellow tape looking on at a giant metal ring which fell from space on to farmland in Mukuku, Kenya "&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A crowd, including police officers, stand behind yellow tape looking on at a giant metal ring which fell from space on to farmland in Mukuku, Kenya.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is Space Debris Becoming More Dangerous?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Kenya Nuclear Regulatory Authority&lt;/strong&gt; confirmed the ring carried slightly elevated &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/chernobyls-dogs-are-evolving-at-a-record-speed/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="72602" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;radiation levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, though “not at a level harmful to humans.” Still, the incident rattled locals, some of whom reported cracks in their homes and worried about future health risks. Others demanded compensation, pointing to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/06/is-the-moon-the-next-billionaires-playground-a-trillion-dollars-worth-of-platinum-is-waiting/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="91685" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Outer Space Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes the launching state legally liable for damage caused by its space objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Pinpointing responsibility, however, is tricky. KSA director general Brigadier Hillary Kipkosgey noted the ring was a “common item in many rockets” and said investigations were ongoing. The &lt;strong&gt;UK Space Agency&lt;/strong&gt; suggested it may belong to an &lt;strong&gt;Ariane rocket&lt;/strong&gt; launched in 2008. If so, the ring could have been silently orbiting Earth for more than 16 years before its fiery descent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Global Challenge Growing Harder to Ignore&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t an isolated event. NASA estimates over &lt;strong&gt;6,000 tons of space debris&lt;/strong&gt; currently orbit our planet, with more than&lt;strong&gt; 27,000 pieces&lt;/strong&gt; large enough to be tracked. Most of this material burns up on re-entry, but larger fragments can survive—and as the number of satellites and rockets in use climbs, so do the odds of impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar incidents have already been recorded across Africa. In 2023, suspected space debris was found scattered across villages in western Uganda. Just days after the Mukuku crash, residents of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia reported seeing bright objects streaking through the night sky. Each event underscores the growing unpredictability of orbital junk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why the World Needs to Act—Now&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts agree on one thing: the planet can’t afford to treat space as a dumping ground. Proposed solutions range from satellites capable of capturing debris to passive systems that de-orbit old spacecraft safely. But as the KSA warns, these fixes are technically complex and costly, and international cooperation remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;For Mukuku’s residents, the danger feels personal. “We need assurances from the government that it won’t happen again,” said local resident Benson Mutuku. Their fears echo a larger reality: without robust global rules and technology to manage space waste, more communities could find themselves at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

The study found that individuals with higher IQs consistently made more realistic forecasts about how long they would live, compared to people with lower IQs. These findings suggest that intelligence plays a direct role in shaping the quality of our beliefs about the world, and may help explain why lower intelligence is often linked to poor financial decisions and other judgment errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IQ, short for intelligence quotient, is a standardized measure of a person’s cognitive abilities, such as memory, problem-solving skills, reasoning, and verbal comprehension. It is usually assessed through a series of tests designed to measure a person’s mental performance relative to others. While the concept of IQ is sometimes debated, it remains one of the most widely used tools for evaluating general cognitive ability. IQ scores are often used in research to study how intelligence influences various life outcomes, including health, income, education, and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/chris-dawson"&gt;Chris Dawson&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Bath, conducted the study to explore whether intelligence is linked to the accuracy of people’s probabilistic judgments—specifically, how well individuals can estimate the likelihood of uncertain future events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many theories in psychology and economics assume that better decision-making depends on accurate beliefs about the world, few studies have directly tested whether IQ affects how well people can form these beliefs. Dawson’s work aimed to fill this gap by examining whether people with higher intelligence are more “calibrated” in their predictions—meaning their beliefs are closer to statistical reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accurate beliefs are important because they guide decisions that affect our health, finances, and well-being. For example, someone who accurately estimates how long they will live may be better at planning for retirement or making decisions about savings and insurance. In contrast, someone who consistently overestimates their future lifespan might save too little or make poor health decisions. By studying how IQ relates to these predictive abilities, Dawson hoped to better understand one of the psychological mechanisms linking intelligence to life outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is huge amount of research looking at how people deviate from rational thinking models (like expected utility theory, where rational people weight up the probability of a decision leading to good/bad outcome and the pleasure/pain from these potential outcomes),” Dawson told PsyPost. “However, little evidence has focused on people’s ability to assess the probabilities of uncertain events, a central input into rational decision making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this question, Dawson used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a nationally representative panel of adults in England over age 50. The sample included 3,946 participants who were interviewed multiple times between 2002 and 2019. Across these nine waves of data collection, participants were repeatedly asked to estimate their chances of living to a certain age (such as 75 or 85), depending on how old they were at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These subjective probabilities were compared to statistical forecasts based on national life expectancy data, allowing the researcher to calculate how far off each person’s prediction was from what actuarial tables would suggest. These differences were used to measure each person’s forecast error, or the gap between their belief and the most likely reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IQ was measured using a broad range of cognitive tasks. These included memory tests, number puzzles, executive function tasks, word recall, semantic fluency, and other mental exercises. The scores were combined into a composite IQ score for each participant, referred to in the study as “phenotypic IQ.” In addition to this behavioral data, Dawson also used participants’ genetic data to calculate polygenic scores—estimates of each person’s genetic predisposition toward higher IQ or greater educational attainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a strong and consistent relationship between IQ and the accuracy of probabilistic judgments. People with higher phenotypic IQs made predictions that were closer to reality, both on average and over time. In statistical terms, a one-standard-deviation increase in IQ was associated with a nearly 20% reduction in the size of forecast errors. High-IQ individuals were not only less biased in their predictions but also less noisy—that is, their estimates varied less from one occasion to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estimating probabilities accurately leads to better decision making and therefore better outcomes for individuals,” Dawson explained. “For instance, if you overestimate the probability of a business idea succeeding, you may waste all your resources starting a business destined to fail. If you underestimate the probability of dying from lung cancer, you may decide not to quit smoking. Being realistic is important and people should try and be realistic in all aspects of decision making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support a causal interpretation, Dawson used a method called Mendelian randomization, which leverages the randomness of inherited genetic traits. By using polygenic scores for IQ as instrumental variables, the study was able to show that genetically influenced differences in IQ predicted the accuracy of people’s forecasts. The analysis also used a similar approach with genetic scores for educational attainment, which include both cognitive and noncognitive traits. While these scores were also linked to better calibration, the effect was weaker than for IQ alone, suggesting that intelligence itself plays a central role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawson also looked at “noise”—the variability in a person’s predictions across time. Even when asked the same question at different points, lower-IQ individuals showed much more inconsistency in their responses. For example, someone with low IQ might give very different answers about their chance of living to age 80 depending on the day they are asked, while a higher-IQ person would give more stable answers that remain close to the statistical expectation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support the idea that intelligence helps people form beliefs that are not only more accurate but also more stable. That matters because noisy or inconsistent beliefs can lead to poor decisions even if they’re not systematically biased in one direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a study that shows that &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/financial-optimism-linked-to-lower-cognitive-ability/"&gt;lower IQ leads to people being a bit more optimistic&lt;/a&gt; than usual about their future,” Dawson noted. “I thought in the current study lower IQ people may also display this optimism bias, but actually they were just more wrong in both optimistic and pessimistic directions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included a wide array of control variables. These covered demographic factors like age and sex, as well as health, wealth, education, and the socioeconomic status of the participants’ parents. This allowed Dawson to isolate the specific influence of intelligence on forecast accuracy, independent of other life circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like all research, it was not without limitations. One issue is that all participants were over age 50 and lived in England, so the findings may not generalize to younger populations or people in other countries. In addition, even though Mendelian randomization helps to rule out some confounding factors, it cannot prove causation beyond all doubt. There could still be unknown environmental or cultural variables that influence both intelligence and prediction accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sample is on an older cohort of individuals tested on a specific probabilistic task (i.e., life expectancy),” Dawson said. “I see no reason to suspect that this result would not hold for younger people or different probability tasks, but I have no evidence for this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the study sheds light on an important psychological link between intelligence and decision quality. By showing that higher IQ is associated with more accurate and consistent probabilistic beliefs, the research suggests that cognitive ability may play a key role in shaping how people perceive the world—and by extension, how effectively they navigate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m currently working with one of my PhD students (Yuyuan Wang) in assessing how low and high IQ types incorporate their probabilistic expectations into their decisions,” Dawson added. “Early evidence suggests high IQ people invest more for their retirement if they expect to live longer (this is rational as if you expect to live longer you need more resources for retirement). However, low IQ people don’t seem to use probabilistic expectations in their decision making. For this group, there was no relationship between life expectancy expectations and savings/investments for retirement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000567"&gt;IQ, Genes, and Miscalibrated Expectations&lt;/a&gt;,” was published online on June 12, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 10:05:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQdUI4UE9wTHpXOHlOMU9kaC1ydVVpOTBSZlVGem5oMGl0bW50aS1RSlVGQWhrT0Z2Snk0cnVCLXk5Qm9xajhjRVkxQmdtNjdtT1FyR1VHRHljVktLOWJjWVJ0MUdwU0xiMUtuckJILXUwTWxIaFJSVlJsOFJsRnkwY2pTNHhVRzgtR3ZOMDh1S21rcVF2ZTU3eUVpRE9DdGpYb2h6Ym9ITmZwWng2</guid></item><item><title>这种日常水果是一种补水英雄，甚至可以预防癌症。-女性健康</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNM3pNLUJBb0dyWDlXRlRoUlpoYXhNVW1SVXdCQnRsbzJjbWo2LW15VWthNXcyQ1JSU25OWnFpUFFEdWUzaUl1amxfR0k5VWdkWUxxVGFkeDlncFFLUWtHT0NnR1hBM1BrbklVdjBnZXVlVktYN0tXa3AweXhwOG00aTBQQWJHQ0Y0d1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="0" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.0"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.0.0"&gt;A new scientific paper suggests a common fruit may have been overlooked in its &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a42814908/are-mushrooms-good-for-you/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a42814908/are-mushrooms-good-for-you/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="superfood" data-node-id="0.0.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;superfood&lt;/a&gt; potential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.1"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.1.0"&gt;Grapes are a source of more than 1,600 compounds, including antioxidants and other polyphenols, making them a great superfood, the paper states.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.2"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.2.0"&gt;Dietitians agree.

found in grapes, and it has been noted with anti-inflammatory benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Grapes specifically support heart health, brain health, improved immune system functions, and may even provide protection against some cancers, Cording says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-antioxidants-and-polyphenols" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;What are antioxidants and polyphenols?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Antioxidants are compounds that protect your cells from damage caused by free radicals (unstable molecules that are linked to several diseases), Gans explains. “Polyphenols, a type of antioxidant found in plant foods, are especially known for their anti-inflammatory properties and heart-healthy benefits,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

pointed out that there’s no agreed-on definition among experts when it comes to what constitutes a superfood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Gans is also wary of using this word to describe foods. “It suggests one food can work magic, when health is really about your overall eating pattern,” she says. “That said, nutrient-packed picks like blueberries, salmon, lentils, leafy greens, and nuts all offer powerful benefits.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093

Well, &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/when-to-take-magnesium-supplements-8765179" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;per Health.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the timing of when you take it in “does not typically affect how well it works or the potential side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LYIWSA2CUJANXKDQSFBGDRFWRY"&gt;But, the site says, if you are aiming to combat anxiety, brain health, migraines or constipation, morning may be best to be sure you are getting your magnesium fix. If you are looking to have it aid in sleep and relaxation, the site says, night may be the best time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="V334VXVD25AWBAD6A3GG7ZNIQE"&gt;Whenever you do take magnesium, there is one key, though. Once you start, &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/when-to-take-magnesium-supplements-8765179" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Health.com&lt;/a&gt; says, you have to take it consistently to see the

vertigo but when there was no improvement with medication, an MRI scan three months later revealed a brain tumour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The 63-year-old freelance photographer described his diagnosis as a "scary process".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he said he will "never forget the emotional release when the nurse told me my tumour was benign".

&lt;p&gt;I had a double mastectomy when I was 40 years old in 1997. I was married and had two children under the age of 11. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting off my breasts when I didn’t have cancer seemed radical, but it wasn’t radical to me. I have the BRCA1 gene mutation. That means I have a 60% chance of getting ovarian cancer and an 85% chance of getting breast cancer ― the deadly kind that doesn’t respond to treatment. For me, those odds felt like 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before genetic testing was available, my mother got ovarian cancer when she was 62 and a few years later, she died. Then two of my cousins got breast cancer before they were 60 and both of them died. So, I got a prophylactic hysterectomy and a double mastectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I’m 64, and I know I made the right decision because I’m alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the surgery, I spoke to a few other women who had mastectomies. They told me how it hurt to lift their arms after the procedure and how it took months to stretch their skin to accommodate the implants used to make reconstructed breasts. None of that scared me. I knew that a cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, and death were, of course, much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I had the surgery and then took my son to his first day of kindergarten three days later with surgical drains hiding under an oversized shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask the plastic surgeon how my breasts would look after the reconstruction. I even thought they would look better, fuller, like they did before I nursed two babies. I was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My implants are nothing like the ones many women get to look and feel sexier. Mine, the kind you get when the surgeon scrapes every bit of breast tissue out, are right under the skin. The skin covering the implants is thin and taut, and cold to the touch ― a different temperature than the rest of my body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that breast reconstruction after a radical mastectomy is a difficult process. After the initial surgery, I had surgery six more times over the next 15 years to deal with the pain caused by scar tissue, and also to try to make my boobs look more normal. Three times, the plastic surgeons attached fake nipples made from skin taken from my pubic area, and they always fell off within a month of the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boobs were ugly, and I hated to let anyone see them. Even doctors couldn’t hide their disgust. When I went to the dermatologist once a year for a skin cancer screening, I reminded him about my mastectomies and reconstruction to avoid the slightest change in his facial expression, like I saw the last time he opened my paper gown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the surgery, I shut the door when I took a shower or turned away from my husband when I changed my clothes in front of him. I never asked him if he wanted to see or feel my boobs, nor did he ask. I kept my T-shirt on during sex for the remaining 12 years of our marriage, and we never talked about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my divorce and more reconstructive surgery, my breasts, now with tattooed nipples where the flesh ones should have been, looked better, but they still weren’t “normal.” They were too hard and too cold. When I started dating, it had been 30 years since I was with a man other than my husband. I was anxious about intimacy, about letting a man see or touch my over-50 body. But my breasts made me consider never dating again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I told the first man I dated how taking my shirt off made me uncomfortable, he said, “You never have to take your shirt off for me. We’ll play shirts and skins, like in a pickup basketball game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly, that’s what we did for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, when I started seeing David, I went over to his house for dinner. We were standing in his kitchen talking and sipping our drinks, a vodka cranberry for me, and a scotch for him. He looked at me and said, “I’m dying to kiss you,” and leaned in for the kiss. I kissed him back. It felt good. As the kissing got more passionate, we moved to the couch. A few minutes in, I pulled away and put my hand on his chest. &lt;/p&gt;

However, during the last century or so, they’ve expanded their range across North America. “It’s likely due to habitat changes, as well as the fact that competitors, such as eastern red wolves, have been removed from the landscape,” says Michel Kohl, PhD, Certified Wildlife Biologist, wildlife extension specialist and associate professor of wildlife management at the&lt;a href="https://warnell.uga.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of Georgia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; University of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re one of the few large carnivores in North America, and they do well in close proximity to people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While you may think spotting a coyote (&lt;em&gt;Canis latrans&lt;/em&gt;) in your neighborhood is rare, it’s actually not uncommon. “Coyotes are adaptable to whatever environment they come across,” says Sheldon Owen, PhD, wildlife extension specialist at &lt;a href="https://extension.wvu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:West Virginia University;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;West Virginia University&lt;/a&gt;.  “They carve out a niche for themselves, even in an urban setting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The greatest risk with coyotes is that&lt;a href="https://bugwoodcloud.org/resource/files/25267.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:they can carry diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; they can carry diseases&lt;/a&gt; that are transmissible to people and pets, says Kohl. That includes canine distemper, parvo, and fleas, ticks and the mites that cause mange. Like all mammals, coyotes also can carry rabies, but it’s a small number: Less than 1.5 percent of all wildlife rabies cases are associated with coyotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Generally, coyotes are not an issue for homeowners and&lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/coyotes-are-everywhere/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prefer to steer clear of us;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; prefer to steer clear of us&lt;/a&gt;. “The most common call we get about coyotes is people saying, ‘I saw a coyote in my back yard,’” says Owen. “That could be an issue, especially if you have small pets. But most potential negative interactions are entirely preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Meet The Expert&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michel Kohl&lt;/strong&gt;, PhD., is a Certified Wildlife Biologist, wildlife extension specialist and associate professor of wildlife management at the University of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Identifying Coyotes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As part of the same genus as domestic dogs, coyotes may resemble a dog from a distance. In fact, they’re roughly the size of a medium dog, weighing about 30 to 35 pounds and about 36-inches tall at the shoulders. They’re very lean-looking and have a bushy tail that’s held out at downward sloping angle, says Owen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Coyote coloring can range from a mottled grey to reddish or all black. In the South, there’s a higher percentage of all black coats, says Kohl. Coyotes tend to be most active at dusk and dawn, but it’s also normal to see them occasionally during the day and doesn’t mean they are rabid, says Kohl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Packs may consist of a mated pair and sometimes few young pups. You’re most likely to see coyotes in the spring when the pups are learning to hunt, and in the fall, when the teenagers are out searching for their own territories, says Owen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s also possible you may hear them at night, rather than see them. Coyotes vocalize to defend their territories and for inter-pack communication. In fact, they have some of the most complex and varied vocalization abilities in the animal kingdom. “It can sound like a pack of coyotes but actually may only be two or three,” says Kohl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Understanding Coyotes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With a keen ability to adapt to their environment, coyotes have a generalist diet. While they do hunt small mammals, including rabbits, mice, voles, small dogs and cats, they’ll also eat dead animals, pet food, and trash, as well as berries, grass, and vegetation, says Kohl. They are often solitary when hunting or foraging but can hunt as a pack, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Coyotes breed in late winter to early spring with pups born in late spring in an average of five per litter. They den in places such as under fallen logs and in thick brush or rock piles. They  typically don’t like to den close to our homes, however, like other animals such as a&lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/how-to-get-rid-of-groundhogs-8707336" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:groundhog;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; groundhog&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/how-to-keep-raccoons-away-11729758" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:raccoon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; raccoon&lt;/a&gt; might do under a shed or crawlspace. Depending on competition for food, these animals maintain a territory of several square miles in an urban setting and a larger area in a more rural setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What To Do If You See a Coyote In Your Yard&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most negative interactions with coyotes can be avoided, if you follow these tips from Kohl and Owen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be aware that coyotes are part of our landscape, even in cities&lt;/strong&gt;. As coyotes expand their territories, you may encounter these animals in your yard or garden. “Have an awareness that they can be out there, even in a neighborhood setting,” says Owen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your dog on leash when walking them, especially at dawn and dusk.&lt;/strong&gt; Coyotes will attack small dogs, though attacks on medium and large dogs are uncommon, says Kohl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch pets when outdoors, even in a fenced area.&lt;/strong&gt; Coyotes are good climbers and can scale a 6-foot fence, says Owen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t allow cats to roam.&lt;/strong&gt; Research has found that both domestic and feral cats are food sources for coyotes, says Kohl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t leave pet food outside.&lt;/strong&gt; Like other types of wildlife, such as&lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/how-to-keep-raccoons-away-11729758" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:raccoons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; raccoons&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/how-to-get-rid-of-opossums-8411521" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:opossums,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; opossums,&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/how-to-keep-skunks-out-of-yard-11758949" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skunks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; skunks&lt;/a&gt;, coyotes love an easy meal and will quickly learn where to find one, says Owen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure pets are up-to-date on medications.&lt;/strong&gt; That includes preventive treatments for&lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-11705931" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fleas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; fleas&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/how-to-get-rid-of-fleas-11705931" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ticks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; ticks&lt;/a&gt; and heartworm and vaccinations for parvo, distemper and rabies, says Kohl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure chicken coops and livestock are protected&lt;/strong&gt;. If using fencing, an&lt;a href="https://extension.wvu.edu/natural-resources/wildlife/coyotes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:electric wire;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; electric wire&lt;/a&gt; at the top and bottom of fencing can discourage coyotes but won’t harm them, says Owen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use hazing techniques to chase a coyote out of your yard.&lt;/strong&gt; If you see a coyote passing through, bang pots and pans, yell, or use an air horn to scare it off. They typically are skittish and will flee. A startling device, such as a motion-activated water sprinkler, also may work. “The goal is to keep them afraid of us,” says Kohl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forget about repellants or essential oils.&lt;/strong&gt; These have questionable or no effectiveness, says Owen. In fact, the coyote may just pee on any scent repellants you use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact your state’s local wildlife agency if you have concerns about a frequent visitor.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have livestock or chickens that are disappearing, if you see a coyote frequently on your property, or if you encounter a coyote that seems to have lost its fear of humans, you may need to have it removed. “If you’re yelling at it and the coyote is still standing there looking at you, that’s a situation we don’t want occurring,” says Kohl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Will Coyotes Attack My Dog?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Interactions with pets do occur, though the outcomes are varied and unpredictable. While coyotes will attack smaller dogs, attacks on medium or large dogs are uncommon. “Social hierarchy is part of the canid world, so coyotes will pick on little dogs but are unlikely to  do so with big dogs because they know it’s probably a contest they can’t win,” says Kohl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In cases where people have reported a pack of coyotes have lured a larger dog into the woods, it’s more likely that the dog is being territorial and chasing the coyote. However, once the dog enters the wooded area, the coyote’s pack mates naturally will defend it, says Kohl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Are Coyotes Dangerous?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most of the time, coyotes stay out of our way. “But it depends on how they have been interacting with people,” says Kohl. “Although coyote attacks on people are rare, most of the time they’re traced back to the fact that a human has been feeding a coyote so the animal has become habituated to us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fortunately, if you spot a coyote, it’s likely just passing through and isn’t interested in you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The biggest risk coyotes pose to our lives is the potential disease transmission to our pets,” says Kohl. To protect your animals, make sure that all of their vaccines are up-to-date and that you regularly use preventives to protect your pets against heartworm, fleas and ticks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/what-to-do-if-coyote-in-yard-11783774" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Southern Living;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Southern Living&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 01:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE9uX0ZBaDJ2aFRKX2xPY2x0TF9zLXpyaVZhVjdvZjE1dnhYeDdhdzBYa2RhY3hEcGJySTlMX3pBUkhPMGhRbjZLc3RxYzVYNzIxQ0FOLTZ6ckFBaTVwOEt4NFFHR09oNV84TkV2NmdOLTctRklpQWNqYnZVcWQ</guid></item><item><title>医生警告说，致命的“食肉”细菌病例在墨西哥湾沿岸上升- ABC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQdEFZYUgzWDh5bXR6YkxNTVJ5N0RvNFU0TmJPbEktYTk2aXVOazN3eVY2OVBwSlA5VGEwd0k1d0g5WV9mVnpCSFlraTdVNFNqejVOZjVQYzg5VXFlTGpPdFVjS3dyWXY0aVJLU0lvaE5BLTkyVXRnVjBlNkNhQjdnS1BMbEpDdXlVTFQzTnFOQVp3eDQtcHRpQnhReGdwb1dz0gGmAUFVX3lxTE16VlBWakEyaWJrcUlLdUgwMUhXX1R5bW8xTnBXbHhzYjVCSWxETFJKcTg0NmxCY1dlUTdyNElvYlowYzduU2VjdjFOM09QOUc4N3ZuWi1UWEpNSWxHZ1FqbUJtVHhyUVpYdHpOY25RbE9WZFZvQkQ1SmZ4Qll0Z2NtQ1lRSmFDZmx4RW5IMUwwNkRXalNObzBwS3M2a2lxWEtYRzBPLXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Health officials are warning of a rise in potentially deadly "flesh-eating" bacteria cases along the Gulf Coast, with Louisiana reporting higher numbers than usual this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Louisiana health officials &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025" target="_blank"&gt;have reported 17 cases of Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/a&gt; so far this year -- four of which have resulted in death.

Brackish water occurs where fresh water meets salt water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The bacteria can infect people in two ways: through open wounds exposed to coastal waters or by eating raw or undercooked seafood, particularly oysters.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX — A Massachusetts woman said she has racked up $20,000 in medical bills after she was attacked by a bat while on vacation in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica Kahn told 12News that it happened last year while visiting Arizona with her dad. The two wanted to take photos at Horseshoe Bend. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We love to go to national parks and see those beautiful landscapes, and we're also interested in astrophotography,” Kahn said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at night when Kahn said she noticed some bats flying around and all of a sudden, something strange happened.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I never would have thought that one would fly into my face, but that happened,” Kahn said. "It was a freak accident."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the bats flew into her face and got trapped between the camera and Kahn's mouth, she said. Kahn said she started to scream and that's when part of the bat then entered her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I screamed the loudest I've ever screamed,” she said. "I'm not sure what part of the bat was there, but there was definitely, I got a taste of it, which was pretty gross. And it tastes a little earthy, a little sweet, if you're wondering," &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said it was only in her mouth for a few seconds before it flew out. While she wasn't bitten by the bat, her father, who is a doctor, recommended she go to the hospital and undergo vaccinations against rabies.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, Kahn said, was that she did not have health insurance after losing her job about two months before the incident and declining COBRA coverage. Knowing the shots were going to be expensive, Kahn said she did sign up for insurance and was told that the treatment would be covered, but that wasn't the case.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I went to four different hospitals over the course of my four rabies shots. And, yeah, so now I have close to $21,000,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kahn said the insurance company informed her she did not have immediate coverage and had not met the 30-day waiting period required for the policy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kahn said she has negotiated to lower the cost of some of her medical bills. She is also appealing to have the medical costs covered.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I took a gamble, and I'm really kicking myself down, and I've learned I'll never do that again, but yeah, COBRA is expensive, but it's more expensive to get these, you know, $20,000 bills when a bat flies into your mouth," Kahn said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the incident, Kahn said she has a sense of humor about the situation. She also created a GoFundMe account to help pay for her medical bills. &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-erica-kahn-with-medical-bills-after-rabies-exposure?attribution_id=sl:3525acf9-55e7-42f0-af93-7e777b47ee85&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;ts=1754091608&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet&amp;amp;utm_content=amp13_t1&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;You can find it by clicking here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Conversely, if your heart age matches or beats your birth certificate, you might be on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate their calculator, Khan’s team mined data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NHANES&lt;/a&gt;), a rolling study that measures the health of the U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on 14,000 adults aged 30 to 79 who had never been diagnosed with heart disease. For each person, they calculated chronological age and heart age, then compared the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns were sobering. Across the board, Americans carried older hearts than their birthdays would suggest. Women averaged a heart age of 55.4 despite being only 51.3 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gap was wider for men: an average heart age of 56.7 versus an actual age of 49.7 – roughly seven extra “cardiac birthdays.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-race-and-income-age-hearts"&gt;Race and income age hearts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers drilled deeper into the data to see how these gaps varied by education, income, and race or ethnicity. These factors are known to track with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-remains-the-leading-cause-of-death-worldwide/"&gt;cardiovascular outcomes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men with no more than a high-school education showed the greatest disconnect: almost one-third possessed hearts at least a decade older than their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racial and ethnic contrasts were stark as well. Among men, Black participants had a heart age 8.5 years older than their chronological age. Hispanic men trailed at 7.9 years, followed by Asian men at 6.7 and white men at 6.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women showed similar but smaller gaps. Black women had the oldest hearts relative to their age (a 6.2-year difference), while Asian women had the youngest (2.8 years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers, the authors argue, reveal how structural forces – access to health care, exposure to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chronic-stress-disrupts-gut-bacteria-and-fuels-cancer-progression/"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;, the cost of nutritious food – literally age the heart faster in some communities than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-risk-that-feels-personal"&gt;Risk that feels personal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21493-cardiovascular-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; has remained the nation’s leading cause of death for more than a century, even in the face of better medications and public-health campaigns against &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smoking-related-deaths-will-surge-by-2030/"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key reason, Khan said, is that millions of people who would benefit from preventive therapies never start them – or start too late. She believes the new heart-age tool can turn abstract percentages into something people feel viscerally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people who should be on medicine to lower their risk for heart attack, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stroke-risk-is-elevated-by-air-pollution-and-traffic-noise/"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;, or heart failure are not on these medications,” Khan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this new heart-age calculator will help support discussions about prevention and ultimately improve health for all people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea draws on behavioral research showing that vivid, easily understood messages spur action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person who hears their heart is “ten years older” may grasp the urgency of lowering &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-minimum-amount-of-physical-activity-needed-to-prevent-high-blood-pressure/"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, quitting cigarettes, or beginning statin therapy. They may respond more readily than someone handed a 10 percent risk score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online tool, available for free, asks for five inputs: age, sex, total cholesterol, &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/hdlthegoodcholesterol.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HDL&lt;/a&gt; (“good”) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and whether the user smokes or has diabetes. With one click it produces a heart age and a brief explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan’s team is quick to add caveats. The calculator is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Its equations are built on large-population averages, but individual factors – such as family history, kidney disease, or inflammatory conditions – can raise or lower risk outside the scope of the tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users should discuss results with a clinician before changing medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure clinicians embrace the approach, the researchers are planning follow-up studies that track whether framing risk as age improves adherence to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-minimum-amount-of-physical-activity-needed-to-prevent-high-blood-pressure/"&gt;blood-pressure&lt;/a&gt; drugs, statins, or lifestyle programs. They also aim to see whether it reduces heart attacks and strokes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-through-to-young-adults"&gt;Getting through to young adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One finding leapt out of the NHANES analysis: people in their thirties and forties often carried heart ages ten or more years beyond their chronological age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet they rarely meet intensity thresholds for preventive medications under current guidelines. Khan hopes the metric will spotlight hidden risk among younger adults who still feel invincible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The important thing is that we have very good options available in our toolbox to help slow that aging down if we can identify it,” she said. “This may be even more important in younger people who don’t often think about their risk for heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-heart-age-stats-matter"&gt;Why “heart age” stats matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart-age calculator could also equip public-health agencies and employers to tailor interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities where the average heart age dwarfs chronological age might benefit from subsidized blood-pressure screenings, mobile clinics, or healthier food outlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health campaigns and community-based programs can emphasize the importance and availability of fast walking to improve health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also provide resources and support to facilitate increased fast walking within all communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan echoes that spirit for heart-age awareness. By translating risk into an easy-to-grasp figure, the team hopes to close gaps in prevention and push heart disease – long the country’s top killer – down the leaderboard at last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2836740"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Cardio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2836740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;l&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2836740"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ogy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 22:25:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOWHl2M0VFd2ZhdlpUWXVOQjFpby03MXVfX2NSNlYtRnJ4S0Q3Q3p0aW9IVVFMVlpqREdHMkVtZTVRR0RiVlhINEtWQXQxa2tRMG5zUVphZVFFeWFqa3VJeUxJQ2RseUo4ZkFXc2p0NVM2S1dWSkdiSHBaTkQwTFhwWHFTNG9odGV1RmdVaWIwS3dtUnNmSG53ZU5sWXNFT2M</guid></item><item><title>与癌症和痴呆症有关的危险成分潜伏在美国最受欢迎的罐装鸡尾酒中-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2gFBVV95cUxQYWJTb2lPaFFLejVoRjBnMi1pTWs4aW56bjdfa0w3UW9ySm02dU9sT0RwTmZWV1lfSnR0Q3lWMWFpSTJqNnVXRW1iaHRLZ0ppckNpX2dBaVFIaVdUMURnQkdzbHl3VmQ1NnhSazVtWDQ4RnJXTFlqdjBlbExSaEl3TlhCZ25mSUpYeWQtWEVNTmpxb052VldXLTJiejR1RHZnWENwazZsLTNVYzY3ZnlTM0xrZmFIN0ZnYjY5VkVfREJCQ2g3bHQyLVU1RVpPSk9VNW5BWmdGT2RCQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With summer in full swing, experts are warning against enjoying popular canned cocktails over fears they may accelerate &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-f54f6250-6e43-11f0-b2bd-2165c94e8f3c"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-73313560-6e4c-11f0-b2bd-2165c94e8f3c" class=""&gt;Alcohol&lt;/a&gt; is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, meaning that it can cause damage to cell DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown the substance, even in small amounts, can increase the risk of developing mouth, throat, larynx, esophageal, colorectal, liver and breast cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Technically, alcohol is a carcinogen. Your body metabolizes the alcohol you drink into a chemical called acetaldehyde, which is classified as a carcinogen,' Dr Nishan Tchekmedyian, a hematologist and oncologist at City of Hope in Irvine, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-726ce7e0-6e34-11f0-b2bd-2165c94e8f3c" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Alcohol can also increase cancer recurrence in certain cases. For example, studies show that breast cancer survivors who drank more than three to four drinks per week were at a higher risk for recurrence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular pre-made canned cocktails make enjoying a drink easier than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The demand for alcoholic canned cocktails increased by 20 percent in 2023, and the drinks continue to gain popularity among those under the age of 45, according to a study by Veylinx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, doctors caution even if a beverage has &lt;span&gt;low alcohol by volume (ABV), the ingredients that come with the convenience - including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14843031/Startling-number-foods-drinks-contain-cancer-linked-ingredient-revealed-major-study.html"&gt;food dyes and preservatives&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;span&gt; can increase the risk of developing disease and neurological conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The National Institute of Health has found Yellow 5 to be contaminated with benzidine or other carcinogens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are particularly concerned about colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early onset colorectal cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men under the age of 50 and the second-leading cause for women under 50 in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14799325/addiction-cancer-Crave-book-smoking-alcohol-fast-food.html" class=""&gt;expected to die from colorectal cancer this year&lt;/a&gt;, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While still a minority, experts remain concerned about increasing cases among younger people. Officials estimate 2,600 new cases among those under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Canned cocktails such as Smirnoff Ice Red White &amp;amp; Berry are known to contain Blue 1, Red 40 and sodium citrate as some of their primary ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 Toxicology Reports study conducted in mice found that Blue 1 dye can damage DNA and cause inflammation in the colon, potentially raising the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, previous studies have shown that consumption of Blue 1 can cause seizures, liver damage, thyroid damage and may contribute to the development of tumors in the bladder and stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The petroleum-based dye has also previously been associated with childhood behavioral problems, as well as infertility in adults.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blue 1, also known as Brilliant Blue FCF, is a synthetic water-soluble food dye derived from petroleum that is used in various food items, drugs and cosmetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The dye - which is also a major ingredient in the Monaco Blue Crush canned cocktail - is known to cause allergic reactions and hyperactivity in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Canned cocktails such as Smirnoff Ice Red, White &amp;amp;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Blue 1 is a major ingredient in the Monaco Blue Crush canned cocktail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from this, experts are also warning against ready-to-drink beverages such as canned Aperol spritz, which contains Sunset Yellow FCF (an orange-yellow azo dye) and Ponceau 4R (a red azo dye). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both dyes have been proven to cause allergic skin reactions in sensitive people, such as rash, eczema or hives, and can also lead to shortness of breath and asthma-like attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Nishan Tchekmedyian, a hematologist and oncologist at City of Hope in Irvine, California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While current evidence does not point to a significant cancer risk in adults, studies have shown that excessive consumption of Ponceau 4R can lead to neurological disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe that the dye contains traces of aluminum, a metal that has been previously linked to promoting the development of &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-560e2f40-6e4e-11f0-b2bd-2165c94e8f3c" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and Parkinson's disease in the brain, which can lead to dementia and loss of motor activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingesting aluminum in high quantities can also change the composition of bacteria in the digestive tract (the microbiome) and disrupt the immune system, leading to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has also found that Ponceau 4R can mimic the effects of estrogen in the women potentially affecting sexual function and leading to obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High estrogen levels can increase the risk of certain cancers, particularly breast and uterine cancers, as it can stimulate the excessive growth of cells in these organs, turning them cancerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another popular canned cocktail, especially with younger Americans, is BuzzBallz, which has&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nearly 30 grams of sugar per bottle and harmful dyes such as Yellow 5 and Blue 1, both of which have been linked to hyperactivity and neurological issues in multiple animal studies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sodium citrate is used as a preservative in many drinks including Topo Chico Mango Hard Seltzer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;BuzzBallz drinks are made of harmful dyes such as Yellow 5 and Blue 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'I wouldn't recommend drinking BuzzBallz, not even occasionally,' Dr Michelle Routhenstein, a preventive cardiology dietitian, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With 15 percent alcohol and nearly 30 grams of added sugar in a single serving, they pack an undesirable combination that can spike blood pressure and blood sugar, cause arrhythmias, strain the liver, promote fat buildup, and increase inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'From a cardiovascular standpoint, these drinks pose unnecessary risk with no health benefit, and over time, they can negatively contribute to chronic conditions like heart disease, fatty liver and type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e68953a0-61c0-11f0-84e9-f11a28450733" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess sugar consumption on a regular basis can pave the way for weight gain, high blood pressure, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity, both of which are major risks for cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Heart Association, men should consume no more than 36 grams or 150 calories of sugar per day while women should consume no more than 25 grams or 100 calories of sugar per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Yellow 5, also known as tartrazine, is a synthetic food dye approved by the FDA for use in food, beverages, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have linked the dye to hyperactivity in children and genotoxicity, meaning it can damage DNA and potentially lead to cancer in adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Institute of Health has also found Yellow 5 to be contaminated with benzidine and other carcinogens that can increase the risk of cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Daily Mail has reached out Smirnoff, Monaco Blue, White Claw, Topo Chico and BuzzBallz for a comment, but has not heard back.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 22:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxQYWJTb2lPaFFLejVoRjBnMi1pTWs4aW56bjdfa0w3UW9ySm02dU9sT0RwTmZWV1lfSnR0Q3lWMWFpSTJqNnVXRW1iaHRLZ0ppckNpX2dBaVFIaVdUMURnQkdzbHl3VmQ1NnhSazVtWDQ4RnJXTFlqdjBlbExSaEl3TlhCZ25mSUpYeWQtWEVNTmpxb052VldXLTJiejR1RHZnWENwazZsLTNVYzY3ZnlTM0xrZmFIN0ZnYjY5VkVfREJCQ2g3bHQyLVU1RVpPSk9VNW5BWmdGT2RCQQ</guid></item><item><title>对可能降低癌症治疗效果的常见甜味剂的警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common artificial sweetener loved by millions weakens the effects of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-47601180-6f15-11f0-b899-97c7884526fb"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;University of Pittsburgh researchers discovered that sucralose, a zero-calorie sweetener, reduced immunotherapy effectiveness in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially developed in the 1970s for people with obesity and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-4760d4d0-6f15-11f0-b899-97c7884526fb" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; to sweeten food while avoiding blood sugar spikes, sucralose, more &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14539329/Sugar-free-diet-foods-artificial-sweetener.html"&gt;commonly known as Splenda&lt;/a&gt;, has become ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s used in over 4,500 foods and drinks, including diet sodas and low-calorie foods. In the US, it accounts for 30 percent of the sweetener market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy, which boosts the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells, may reach for a diet soda or sugar-free baked good, believing they’re &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11950929/Youd-need-consume-75-packets-Splenda-DAY-suffer-health-problems-fear.html"&gt;making a healthy choice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, sucralose kills some good bacteria that reside in the gut while allowing harmful strains to grow, impacting the body’s ability to digest foods and break down fiber, train immune cells to fight pathogens, make vitamins like folate and B12, produce serotonin, and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author Dr Diwakar Davar, an oncologist and hematologist at UPMC, said in a statement: ‘We found that sucralose impeded the effectiveness of immunotherapies across a range of cancer types, stages and treatment modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These observations raise the possibility of designing prebiotics, such as targeted nutrient supplementation for patients who consume high levels of sucralose.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cancer patients on immunotherapy might choose diet drinks or sugar-free treats thinking they're healthier options (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team used mouse models, some with lung cancer and some with melanoma, to test how sucralose altered their microbiomes, finding that the sweetener disrupted the delicate balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This reduced key amino acids such as arginine, which are needed to fuel immune cells. It also led to dysfunctional CD8+ T cells, critical for fighting cancer, and blunted the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, a class of cancer treatments that includes popular medicines Keytruda and Opdivo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Dr Abby Overacre, an immunology professor at Pitt and UPMC Hillman, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.upmc.com/media/news/073125-artificial-sweetner"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘When arginine levels were depleted due to sucralose-driven shifts in the microbiome, T cells couldn’t function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘As a result, immunotherapy wasn’t as effective in mice that were fed sucralose.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To assess the relevance of these findings for humans, they questioned 132 advanced cancer patients, including 91 people with melanoma and 41 with lung cancer, about their sucralose intake, as well as 25 people at high risk of their melanoma recurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People reported drinking diet sodas, using the artificial sweetener in coffee and tea, and eating low-calorie snacks sweetened with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high amount of sucralose was considered anything above 0.16 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. For a 155-lb person, that’s less than a single packet of Splenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with melanoma and lung cancer who consumed at least that much sucralose had a 3.2 times higher risk of their cancer progressing faster, as well as less tumor shrinkage in response to immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sucralose reduced immunotherapy effectiveness in various cancers regardless of type, stage, or treatment approach  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People at risk of melanoma recurrence who drank or ate at least that much sucralose had a higher risk of their cancer returning after surgery and immunotherapy and fewer signs of a strong immune response to tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experiments in mice revealed that disruption to the microbiome due to sucralose was the driving force behind alterations in their cancer-fighting T cells, which were starved of the crucial amino acid arginine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When scientists transplanted feces from sucralose-fed mice into untreated mice, the latter exhibited a similar poor immune response to immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when scientists supplemented their low levels of arginine using the amino acid citrulline, commonly found in melons, pumpkins, and legumes, T cells regained their cancer-killing ability, reversed their resistance to immunotherapy, and their tumors shrank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0247/763776/Sucralose-consumption-ablates-cancer-immunotherapy"&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Overacre said: ‘It’s easy to say, “Stop drinking diet soda,” but when patients are being treated for cancer, they are already dealing with enough, so asking them to drastically alter their diet may not be realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We need to meet patients where they are. That’s why it’s so exciting that arginine supplementation could be a simple approach to counteract the negative effects of sucralose on immunotherapy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope to launch a clinical trial investigating whether citrulline supplements, which boost arginine levels more than arginine itself, affect the gut microbiome and anti-tumor immune response in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Instead, it only focuses on the amount of plaque in the body.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scan is meant for those who have a family history of early coronary artery disease and have an intermediate risk for a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also advised to those who have a history of tobacco use, high cholesterol, diabetes or high blood pressure and those who are obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A coronary calcium scan is not recommended as a general screening test for those at a high risk for heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also not recommended to those who have already had an attack, have a heart stent or had coronary artery bypass graft surgery before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Based on the amount of plaque in the arteries, experts assign a calcium test score that can range from zero to over 1,000 (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the amount of plaque in the arteries, experts assign a calcium test score that can range from zero to over 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with a score of 100 or less have mild evidence of CAD, those ranking between 100 to 400 have moderate amount of evidence of the disease and those above 400 have strong evidence of CAD in their bodies, according to Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Robert Segal, a board-certified cardiologist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robert Segal, a board-certified cardiologist said: 'I've seen too many patients suffer heart attacks that could have been prevented by knowing their Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Score. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The CAC Score is one of the most powerful tools we have to detect heart disease early, before symptoms appear. I strongly recommend getting a CAC scan.

Further, 71 per cent were obese and more than one-third had metabolic syndrome — a cluster of risk factors that heighten vulnerability to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_1_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_1_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-1 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_1_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The health of India’s workforce is paramount,” said Nadda, emphasising the ministry of health’s existing guidelines under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD). These guidelines focus on promoting healthy diets, regular exercise, weight control, and reducing intake of sugar and saturated fats.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replying to questions from Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi and others, Nadda said recent Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) findings showed a 37.19 per cent prevalence of fatty liver disease even in rural Rajasthan, underlining its spread beyond urban centres.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_2_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_2_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-2 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_2_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To raise awareness, the government is conducting extensive campaigns across print, electronic, and digital media platforms. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has rolled out creative public outreach materials, including engaging short videos on liver health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising the sedentary nature of IT jobs, the ministry of AYUSH has introduced a five-minute “Yoga Break” protocol to be followed during office hours. It combines simple yoga postures (Asanas), breathing techniques (Pranayama) and meditation (Dhyana) to promote physical and mental well-being.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_3_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_3_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-3 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_3_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, integrated clinical guidelines that blend traditional Indian medicine with modern protocols have been published to ensure a holistic national response. States and Union Territories have been asked to implement screening and referral systems at the community level to aid early detection and intervention.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadda emphasised inter-ministerial collaboration and workplace health advisories as vital tools to combat the rising tide of metabolic and lifestyle diseases, especially in urban corporate ecosystems.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_4_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_4_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-4 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_4_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spotlight on Hyderabad’s IT workforce is galvanising India’s public health machinery to address a crucial but under-recognised epidemic to safeguard the well-being of millions in fast-evolving workplaces. The prevalence of increased liver fat and obesity conditions in IT employees highlights the profound impact of sedentary, high-stress work environments common in the tech industry. These findings have prompted comprehensive workplace wellness initiatives to safeguard the health of India’s young, urban workforce.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad filler-ad-unit-inside-post" id="filler_ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key Highlights:  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. 84% of Hyderabad IT employees affected by MAFLD; 71% obese; 34% with Metabolic Syndrome  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

Here, FEMAIL unpacks the senseless violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being snatched from her mother's car, Measles was taken to River Road in New Milford, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/connecticut/index.html" id="mol-0e8f76f0-6f08-11f0-afe3-fbe74f109da3"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; where her known attackers - Keith Foster, Dorothy Hallas, Maggie Mae Bennett, Alan Walter, Jeffrey Boyette, Ronald Rajcok, Deaneric Dupas, and June Segar - began beating her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The three women who participated in the murder were said to be angry that the teenager had sex with their boyfriends. Measles, however, had been a victim of statutory rape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although she broke away and ran for help, she was chased down by one of the perpetrators, Segar, and dragged back to her death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maryann Measles was last seen on October 19, 1997, when she was abducted from a supermarket parking lot by five men and three women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was years before her friends and family members found out the truth about what happened &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recounting hearing how his late friend Measles died, a man named Scott said in the documentary: 'Them beating on her and raping her and holding her under the water until the bubbles stopped, that's probably the comment that haunts me the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Until the bubbles stopped.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another friend, Donna, added: 'They wrapped her in blankets and chains and they threw her into the river. It breaks my heart that I wasn't there to help her.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Months before her life was taken, Measles began hanging out with the group of older friends who would later attack and kill her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One evening, she confessed to her mother that she had been raped by some of the older men in the group, including Walter and Foster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles's mother took her to the police station to file statutory rape charges against the men, however only filed a report regarding Walter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although they planned to file a report against Foster, the group of friends hatched a plan to silence Measles, who had opened up about her ordeal and confined in her plan to June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine months after her death, Measles's body was found in Lake Lillinonah in Connecticut, but it was still years before police made any progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Measles was in the seventh grade when her friends kidnapped her and killed her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the summer of 2001, four years later, cops offered a $50,000 reward for people to come forward with evidence to help solve the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Segar, one of the killers, was keen to get her hands on the money and in 2005, she reached out to police and led them to a crucial piece of evidence: an abandoned washing machine in the middle of the woods containing Measles's clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After linking herself to the crime, Segel admitted that there was eight people involved in the murder and that Walter orchestrated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking in the documentary, Measles's friend Ashleigh said: 'I was just so sick to think that Mariann thought she was hanging out with friends, but they were planning on murdering her.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was mind-blowing seeing their pictures in cuffs in the news and all over the newspapers,' Scott added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was like wow, I spent every day with those people. I was hanging out with a group of murderers and I didn't even know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I will always harbour some guilt and blame because I literally introduced one of my best friends to her killers and that will never go away.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walter had sex with the teen's corpse before they wrapped her in blanket, tied it with a chain and padlock and then pushed her into the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foster was the only perpetrator whose case went to trial where he was sentenced to 110 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Keith Foster was sentenced to 110 years in prison for his role in Measles's murder &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alan Walter plead guilty to felony murder, first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first-degree sexual assault, and tampering with physical evidence &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was guilty on charges that included felony murder, first-degree sexual assault, three counts of first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first-degree kidnapping, tampering with a witness, and tampering with physical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Walter was handed a 60-year sentence for his involvement and was charged with felony murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For their part in the murder, Boyette was sentenced to 50 years, Dupas was sentenced to 47 years , Rajcok was sentenced to 36 years, Segar was sentenced to 30 years, and Hallas was sentenced to 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bennett was sentenced to 19 years after she was charged with first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, risk of injury to a minor, tampering with a witness, and tampering with evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time of writing, only one out of the eight perpetrators has been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bennett, who received the lightest sentence due to her plea deal, was freed in 2019 after 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She testified that at least three of the boys took turns raping Measles before dragging her to the water to drown her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reflecting on the murder, Measles's younger sister commented in the documentary: 'Two of the guys would have got 18 months for statutory rape, so instead they ended her life and ruined all of ours forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've never raised my kids to believe there are not monsters… I've lived my life with eight monsters.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 20:47:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPaUZJUEVlT0VBV2FKMHgtYjZfOE9HOEVhRy1Md1RfWkJnajU5aS03NDdwcENmUzRQQnBlbGNCNURxeDZwM09KcXFYb3pPUFpvWWdNTGdQN2hKS01NaWJRU3VwTF9CSWh6ODN3ck5mSkdfaU1sMTN2WFFXTlpINWJUWVJLT1U2S1llQWcyLTVlOFZmMGdkb0xqbTYtYXY3dXIwT3Rhb29mWnRZZE1F0gGyAUFVX3lxTE5lcmZtMVpXOF85SUlvbF9LZlc2emRSUGg0elRBWUhDb2tsRWdYLTY0VnQyT0d3Nkc2LXhoV24yenEzSENUYlVYMTM3TkpJSXhlQTg3S1pVNC1UejZJaWZLYVpNMjMtSXd5U19yS2F5WG91VzZjUVdvVHhnT0w1MkJkcmpVV0hueVNiVEtxWmE0dzFCWDg5SmlrVlBibjVXSkt6R2liSDZYaTBvUmE4Q25HdHc</guid></item><item><title>在RFK Jr的领导下， CDC跳过了疫苗接种率的研究，悄悄地在DROP上发布数据- Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNQUFlZ3hRMDRNNWJjU3EwOWRfUjBxajRNbTA5alprcW9ocVgwbDVzVzJzV1NqQzVsSGxEdjJWR3BNN193dnNpMXktRk5iQ05KeWllaW5wT2NjY3d5RW5vaWZJMnFEcWNRZ3hVdjB1M0VodWZpdTZLd1NwQmwySWpLZDF6TlNyYU9BQ3E0dmJfeS1vaVV1TDdaWXo5ZVZHelhsaEJPR2pRSkF4YWI0TE9idUczc0RKMTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates among the country's kindergartners have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;fallen once again&lt;/a&gt;, with coverage of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination dropping from 92.7 percent in the 2023–2024 school year to 92.5 percent in 2024–2025. The percentage changes are small across the board, but they represent thousands of children and an ongoing downward trend that makes the country more vulnerable to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest school year, an estimated 286,000 young children were not fully protected against measles. At the same time, the country has seen numerous explosive measles outbreaks, with case counts in 2025 already higher than any other year since the highly infectious disease was declared eliminated in 2000. In fact, the case count is at &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/measles-cases-reach-33-year-high-as-rfk-jr-pursues-anti-vaccine-agenda/"&gt;a 33-year high&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest small decline is one in a series that is eroding the nation's ability to keep bygone infectious diseases at bay. In the 2019–2020 school year, 95 percent of kindergartners were protected against measles and other serious childhood diseases, such as polio. That 95 percent coverage is the target that health experts say prevents an infectious disease from spreading in a community. But amid the pandemic, vaccination rates fell, dropping to 93.9 percent MMR coverage in the 2020–2021 year, and have kept creeping downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anti-vaccine era&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the height of the pandemic, some slippage in immunization coverage could be blamed on disrupted access. But anti-vaccine sentiments and misinformation are clearly playing a large role as vaccination continues to decline and access has largely resumed. For the 2024–2025 school year, nonmedical exemptions for childhood vaccinations once again hit a new high. These are exemptions driven by ideology and have risen with the influence of anti-vaccine voices, including current health secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

They discovered that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14821553/Dirty-habit-smoking-marijuana-heart-health-disease.html"&gt;daily smokers were&lt;/a&gt; 3.25 times more likely to develop oral cancer than those without the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Raphael Cuomo, an anesthesiology professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine who led the analysis, said: ‘Cannabis smoke contains many of the same carcinogenic compounds found in tobacco smoke, which have known damaging effects on the epithelial tissue that lines the mouth.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cannabis smoke packs a heavy load of toxic chemicals and carcinogens, about 2,600 of them, similar to tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But researchers are only recently getting a fuller understanding of what those chemicals are. They now know that marijuana smoke contains hundreds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, and ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These chemicals adhere to mucus membranes in the mouth, enabling carcinogens to seep into oral tissue. Meanwhile, THC, the psychoactive chemical in marijuana, can suppress crucial immune system pathways that would typically patrol for, and kill, those rogue cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly 18 million Americans are daily or near-daily cannabis users, which researchers have found increases the risk of oral cancer by more than three times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the more than 45,000 patients included in the study, 949 had cannabis use disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The group that did not smoke or smoked only occasionally remained either weed free or only occasional users over the five-year study. Over 97 percent were still abstinent or infrequent users by the time researchers followed up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the study, 106 patients were diagnosed with oral cancer. Among people without CUD, the rate of oral cancer was 0.23 percent, which matches general population rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, among participants with CUD, 0.74 percent developed oral cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral cancer includes cancerous growths that develop in the mouth and throat, including the lips, tongue, gums, the floor of the mouth and the roof of the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 59 men and 1 in 139 women will develop oral cancer at some point in their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral cancers account for about three percent of cancers diagnosed in the US every year, with about 58,500 diagnoses and 12,250 deaths annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said their findings will have implications for cancer screening practices in primary care and mental health settings, as patients with CUD often present with overlapping social and behavioral risk factors, including tobacco use, alcohol use, and a lower likelihood of engaging in preventive healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with CUD who were also tobacco users were 6.24 times more likely to get oral cancer. Age also played a role, with each additional year of age increasing cancer risk by about four times per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like tobacco smokers, marijuana smokers see damage to their lung and throat cells, leading to abnormal cell growth that can cause cancer and tissue changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those effects can occur in people who are not tobacco smokers, though, indicating that marijuana smoke can be just as harmful on its own as cigarette smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cuomo said: ‘These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that chronic or problematic cannabis use may contribute to cancer risk in tissues exposed to combustion products.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335525002244"&gt;Preventive Medicine Reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the United States, marijuana is fully legal for recreational and medicinal use in 29 states. It is entirely illegal in four states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of the public, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/03/26/most-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana-for-medical-recreational-use/"&gt;about 88 percent&lt;/a&gt;, supports legalization, according to the Pew Research Center. But public health experts are raising concerns over potential long-term effects, of which scientists still do not have a complete understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In June, University of California researchers reviewed 24 studies involving 200million people to investigate the relationship between weed and cardiovascular disease, stroke and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - a group of heart conditions in which there is reduced or blocked blood flow to the heart, such as a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found there was a 29 percent higher risk of ACS among cannabis users, a 20 percent higher risk for stroke and double the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary artery disease, heart failure and irregular heartbeats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, findings from an FDA-run clinical trial were released, investigating dangerous liver enzyme spikes in people who consumed cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cannabis is becoming easier to access and more potent. The graph refers to smokable cannabis. Other forms, such as vapes, contain up to 98 percent of THC, the psychoactive chemical in the drug linked to psychosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed that eight users of CBD, the substance derived from the hemp plant that's free of the psychoactive chemical THC, developed enzyme spikes above the safe threshold, raising the risk of chronic liver damage or failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seven people dropped out due to liver concerns between weeks three and four. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, everyone's liver tests normalized after quitting CBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, regular use of potent cannabis in adolescence has been linked to long-term changes in brain structure, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, the region responsible for decision-making, emotional regulation, and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is also the age when many psychotic disorders first appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;THC may trigger schizophrenia or psychotic episodes in individuals with genetic predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 review by University of Bath researchers, which analyzed 20 studies involving 120,000 people, found users of high-potency cannabis were four times more likely to develop addiction and three to five times more likely to suffer a psychotic break compared to those using lower-potency strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, a report in JAMA Network Open found that emergency room visits in Ontario, Canada, linked to schizophrenia in marijuana users tripled after legalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2006 and 2022, the rate of schizophrenia among those with cannabis use disorder climbed from four percent to over 10 percent. In contrast, just 0.6 percent of non-users developed the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

People who eventually develop MS began increasing healthcare visits—especially for general symptoms like fatigue, pain, and anxiety—15 years before neurologists identified their first demyelinating event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest a lengthy prodromal phase for MS, similar to early-stage Parkinson’s disease, where nonspecific symptoms quietly precede more recognizable ones. Identifying this earlier timeline could lead to proactive support, monitoring, and even future prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Prodrome:&lt;/strong&gt; Healthcare usage increased steadily over 15 years before MS diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Indicators:&lt;/strong&gt; Fatigue, dizziness, mental health issues, and eye problems were among the first signs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Results challenge the belief that MS only begins with clear neurological symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of British Columbia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest warning signs of multiple sclerosis (MS) may emerge more than a decade before the first classical neurological symptoms occur, according to new research from the University of British Columbia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published today in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, the study analyzed the health records of more than 12,000 people in British Columbia and found that those with MS began using healthcare services at elevated rates 15 years before their first MS symptoms appear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings challenge long-held assumptions about when the disease truly begins, offering the most comprehensive picture to date of how patients engage with a range of healthcare providers in the years leading up to a diagnosis as they search for answers to ill-defined medical challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“MS can be difficult to recognize as many of the earliest signs—like fatigue, headache, pain and mental health concerns—can be quite general and easily mistaken for other conditions,” said senior author Dr. Helen Tremlett, professor of neurology at UBC’s faculty of medicine and investigator at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings dramatically shift the timeline for when these early warning signs are thought to begin, potentially opening the door to opportunities for earlier detection and intervention.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study used linked clinical and administrative provincial health data to track physician visits in the 25 years leading up to the onset of a patient’s MS symptoms, as determined by a neurologist through detailed medical history and clinical assessments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the first study to examine healthcare usage this far back in a patient’s clinical history. Most previous studies only examined trends in the five to 10 years leading up to a patient’s first demyelinating event (such as vision problems) using administrative data. This is a much later benchmark compared to the neurologist-determined date of symptom onset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings revealed that, when compared to the general population, people with MS had a steady build-up of healthcare engagement over 15 years with different types of doctor visits increasing at distinct points in time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;15 years before symptom onset:&lt;/strong&gt; Visits to general practice physicians increased, as did visits to any physician for symptoms like fatigue, pain, dizziness and mental health conditions including anxiety and depression.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;12 years before:&lt;/strong&gt; Visits to a psychiatrist increased.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Eight to nine years before:&lt;/strong&gt; Visits to neurologists and ophthalmologists increased, which could relate to issues like blurry vision or eye pain.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Three to five years before:&lt;/strong&gt; Emergency medicine and radiology visits increased.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;One year before:&lt;/strong&gt; Physician visits across multiple specialties peaked, including neurology, emergency medicine and radiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These patterns suggest that MS has a long and complex prodromal phase—where something is happening beneath the surface but hasn’t yet declared itself as MS,” said Dr. Marta Ruiz-Algueró, a postdoctoral fellow at UBC and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re only now starting to understand what these early warning signs are, with mental health-related issues appearing to be among the earliest indicators.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study builds on previous work by Dr. Tremlett and her team to characterize the early stages of MS, or prodromal phase, when subtle symptoms appear before the hallmark signs become recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prodromal periods are well established in other neurological disorders, like Parkinson’s disease, where mood changes, sleep disturbances and constipation often arise years before the more familiar motor symptoms like tremors and stiffness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the researchers caution that the vast majority of people who experience general symptoms will not go on to develop MS, they say recognizing and characterizing the MS prodrome could one day help accelerate diagnosis and improve outcomes for patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“By identifying these earlier red flags, we may eventually be able to intervene sooner—whether that’s through monitoring, support or preventive strategies,” said Dr. Tremlett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It opens new avenues for research into early biomarkers, lifestyle factors and other potential triggers that may be at play during this previously overlooked phase of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this multiple sclerosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0173647869606f602f69646075696473686f66756e6f417463622f6260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reyhana Heatherington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ubc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Reyhana Heatherington – University of British Columbia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.24635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Healthcare use before multiple sclerosis symptom onset&lt;/a&gt;” by Helen Tremlett et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare use before multiple sclerosis symptom onset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care use increases before multiple sclerosis (MS) onset. However, most studies have focused on the 5 to 10 years preceding the first demyelinating disease code from administrative data. Few studies have examined patterns before clinically determined MS symptom onset from clinical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine health care use 25 years before MS symptom onset in a clinical cohort from British Columbia, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matched cohort study accessed data prospectively collected from January 1991 to September 2018. All data were released mid-2024 for analysis. The study was conducted in British Columbia using publicly funded universal health insurance data. Patients with MS were identified from MS clinic records and matched with up to 5 individuals randomly selected without replacement from the general population by sex, birth year, socioeconomic status, and postal code of residency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked clinical and administrative data were used to compare physician visit rates 25 years before MS onset using adjusted negative binomial models and 15 years before MS onset by &lt;em&gt;International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;ICD-9&lt;/em&gt;) chapter and physician specialty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 2038 patients with MS (mean [SD] age at symptom onset, 37.9 [10.9] years; 1508 female [74.0%]) and 10 182 matched individuals were included. All-cause physician visit rate ratios (RRs) for patients with MS were consistently elevated from 14 years before onset (adjusted RR [ARR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.33), peaking the year before MS onset (ARR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.21-1.35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RRs for ill-defined symptoms and signs were consistently elevated 15 years before onset, exceeding 1.15 and peaking at 1.37 (95% CI, 1.19-1.56) the year before MS onset. Mental health–related RRs from 14 years before onset were significant (excluding years 7, 5, and 4), with RRs in the 3 years before MS onset ranging from 1.30 (95% CI, 1.05-1.58) to 1.38 (95% CI, 1.12-1.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensory, musculoskeletal, and nervous system RRs were elevated 8, 5, and 4 years before onset, respectively, with, for example, a peak of 2.42 (95% CI, 1.90-3.07) for nervous system concerns the year before MS onset. By physician specialty, general practice visit RRs were significantly elevated in each of the 15 years before MS onset, reaching 1.23 (95% CI, 1.17-1.30) in the year before onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatry visit RRs were elevated 12 years before onset (2.59; 95% CI, 1.23-5.47). Neurology and ophthalmology RRs were significantly higher up to 8 to 9 years before onset, peaking the year before MS onset at 5.46 (95% CI, 4.30-6.93) for neurology and 1.64 (95% CI, 1.30-2.08) for ophthalmology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this matched cohort study of people with and without MS, health care use was higher among patients with MS 14 to 15 years before MS symptom onset, suggesting that MS may have started earlier than previously thought. Mental health and psychiatric issues along with ill-defined signs and symptoms might be among the earliest features of the prodromal period preceding nervous system–related and neurologic visits by 7 to 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 19:53:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBVVHlJdkl1eWxZZ1kzMEZuTnNjeVBNUERmekl5REJVZGVEZE1lWUstX1MxM3FGbW5iZDdEb2hzLXd5a0hEeGhUV2phaVh1MGxmY0tWQWEwYi1xOGlON3JIcldENTRtNzFpdTZiZkw5RWhSeWdm</guid></item><item><title>蝙蝠在亚利桑那州飞进女人的嘴里，花费了她近21,000美元的医疗费用- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxON28zSUZrTmsyOE1yMDdDVUlXR194TkRybzczSTFpQjZaQmtZb3NDYTNmbHh3eW80RzdzZDFBNk1oaUZvNzIxZ2l5ZVhIdU0zOWdTalZHYjA0Ui1HRzBjNlRjU0UyYzVQa0JscEVPeXBwVmFXMlRia3pCdWpJalR6T1RWdzRpSTlSeVQyOUVHUmoyUl9pWjRuU2hUb1N1amtaUm90ZmN0NUJ3ei1Rd1E0dnJaRdIBVkFVX3lxTE1iUmthYXJ4eW5FYnc2bWJxSGdnMHpzZy1QdG9pNHZvRUxWVGhjWWsyR1RjaGttWFdONlBRaHhaYlpsa05yOWtod1ZCa0RtaklvdzRzUGt3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2eaaeb" class="body-graf"&gt;A Massachusetts woman was bitten by nearly $21,000 in medical bills &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/chicago-concert-rabies-bat-exposure-rcna174362" target="_blank"&gt;after a bat flew &lt;/a&gt;into her mouth during a freak incident while vacationing in Northern Arizona, the unlucky traveler said Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d7038d" class="body-graf"&gt;Erica Kahn, now 33, had recently lost her job as a biomedical engineer when she traveled to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in last August, she told NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b92c72" class="body-graf"&gt;Kahn, whose woman-vs.-animal story was first reported Thursday by &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/tourist-rabies-treatment-wild-bat-in-mouth-surprise-bill-of-the-month/" target="_blank"&gt;KFF News&lt;/a&gt;, was snapping pictures of the night sky when a bat approached and got caught in between her camera and face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b87d6f" class="body-graf"&gt;Then a part of the bat got into her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-398796" class="body-graf"&gt;"It was kind of dark out and we were out on a cliff, so I was looking down and at my camera, I didn't really see it coming," she said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c0e59e" class="body-graf"&gt;"When it got kind of tangled between my face and the camera, it was probably just like a few seconds.

The second patient, age 15 months, had previously been healthy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health care providers should suspect &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;B. procyonis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; infection in patients with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, especially young children or persons with developmental disabilities or pica and consider empiric treatment with albendazole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both patients received the antiparasitic drug albendazole and corticosteroids. The first patient recovered neurologically, but the second patient developed severe persistent neurologic complications after a substantial delay in receiving an accurate diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Epidemiologic investigation identified raccoon feces that had fallen from a rooftop latrine (communal raccoon defecation site) as the possible source of exposure for the teen, but a source wasn't identified for the younger child. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Health care providers should suspect &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;B. procyonis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; infection in patients with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, especially young children or persons with developmental disabilities or pica and consider empiric treatment with albendazole," the authors concluded. "In addition, the public should be aware of exposure prevention strategies, including preventing raccoon activity around properties, avoiding exposure to raccoon feces, and safely removing raccoon latrines."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

What do you feel? Maybe the rays are warm and comforting on your skin. Maybe you tilt your head back, close your eyes, and see bright spots behind your eyelids. Maybe the sun is helping you feel happy and energized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The sun's ray can have a profound effect on our bodies. According to a growing amount of research, sunlight kicks off an array of complex biological processes. It impacts our skin, of course, but it can also alter our nervous systems or our lymph and organs, it can slow down our immune response and lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But could sunlight actually help treat disease? Studies have found potential benefits of light therapy for conditions like multiple sclerosis, Type 1 diabetes and Crohn's disease. And so that's what we're looking at today, harnessing the health secrets of the sun. And we're going to start today with Prue Hart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;She's a professor at the Western, excuse me, the University of Western Australia, located at the Kids Research Institute in Perth, and her research focuses on the effects of ultraviolet radiation and vitamin D on the immune system. And she joins us from Perth, Australia. Professor Hart, welcome to On Point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;PRUE HART: Thank you. Very happy to speak to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Before we dive into the actual science of what sunlight does to the skin, it occurs to me that since I'm speaking to you and you're in Australia, one of the most sort of sun-drenched places in the world. Is that what got you interested in studying the effects of ultraviolet violet radiation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;What's the story behind your the thrust of your research?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: Look I grew up in sunny country. Yes, we grew up thinking sun must be bad for you and bad for your skin. But I think we are all learning now that the harm benefits of the sun are really only at the skin level. The benefits of sun is really the whole-body effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-pullquote breakout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-pullquote-text"&gt;The benefits of sun is really the whole-body effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="article-pullquote-attribution"&gt;Prue Hart&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And so I think we've got to consider harm versus benefit and just in the last few years that equation, the benefit is starting to outweigh the harm. Yes, you can get skin cancers, melanoma's the one you have to be worried about. And we can get, our skin ages, obviously, we get a few more wrinkles, but hopefully in this session we'll develop more about the benefits, which really are so important for our human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: So what are some of the benefits that research is starting to show of the effect of sunlight on the human body below the skin level?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: I'm an immunologist, so I'm obviously interested in the autoimmune diseases or any diseases with an inflammatory component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And we know, in fact, most human diseases have an inflammatory component. We know that sunlight, particularly the UVB rays of sunlight, can dampen inflammation, whole body inflammation. We know that it also can reduce stress. We know that sunlight has another, a prong by stimulating adaption in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-pullquote breakout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-pullquote-text"&gt;We know that sunlight, particularly the UVB rays of sunlight, can dampen inflammation, whole body inflammation. We know that it also can reduce stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="article-pullquote-attribution"&gt;Prue Hart&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So we learn to cope better with sunlight. Of course, as your introduction started off, we feel better too. So there's just many ways sunlight is helping us, but I talked about immunology and immunological diseases, autoimmune diseases. But I think Richard Weller is going to talk about cardiovascular diseases where sunlight can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;We know of bone and musculoskeletal health, that was known many decades ago with the advent of discovering vitamin D, but also our neuro system, our endocrine system, our metabolic system, even our eye system, our oculus system. We know myopia is related to children being outside and having more sunlight exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So really the whole-body benefits from sunlight exposure. So we've got to stop this exaggerated fear of skin cancers and think of some of the benefits and the positive aspects of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-pullquote breakout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-pullquote-text"&gt;We've got to stop this exaggerated fear of skin cancers and think of some of the benefits and the positive aspects of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="article-pullquote-attribution"&gt;Prue Hart&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: So I want to, let's take some of these just one by one, but first of all, but before we do that, I've been generically saying sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Is that really what we're talking about, or are we talking about UV and specifically UVB?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: Sunlight's very complex. UV is the highest energy component of sunlight. It's the area where I've been studying. We know of the benefits from UV, but there are benefits of other aspects too. We know about blue light in our circadian setting, our circadian rhythm. We know about infrared light at the other end of the visible spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It can help in repair, it can help in heating the body. It's a whole package in a way. The sun, the benefits of sunlight. But we've evolved this way. We've evolved to get the benefits of sunlight. So not to take advantage of it, to stay inside, is not natural. We didn't evolve that way. We didn't lose pigment in our skin for a reason, not to harness the benefits of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-pullquote breakout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-pullquote-text"&gt;We've evolved to get the benefits of sunlight. So not to take advantage of it, to stay inside, is not natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="article-pullquote-attribution"&gt;Prue Hart&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But UVB is the highest energy area of sunlight, and that's the one we harvest in our treatment of autoimmune diseases, try and dampen those hyperactive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Okay. This is really interesting because again, as you said, sunlight is complex. There's the visible spectrum portion of it, of course, infrared and UV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So I'm going to come back to that in a second, but tell me a little bit more about what is happening as far as we know at the cellular level. Let's take autoimmune diseases. So with immune dampening at the cellular level, when we are exposed to sunlight, how does it actually dampen the immune response?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Yeah, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: We know the skin is a very dynamic and complex organ. It covers our whole body. It's the first line of defense against environmental stresses such as UV. Now we know that the UV photons have a lot of energy. I said they're shorter wavelengths, they're high energy, and we've got cells and molecules in the skin that can absorb that energy and that energy then breaks molecules, changes molecules or chemicals in the skin, and then we get signals going from the skin down to the lymph nodes and into our blood and into our circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And it's not only molecules, but cells themselves can migrate in and out of the skin. As I said, it's a very dynamic organ and we have not only, we have a lot of immune cells and that's probably the greater network that's at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In our dampening of things like multiple sclerosis, but we also have the endocrine system in the skin. We know a lot is happening. It'd be naive to think that there was only one system happening in the skin. It really is many processes interacting with each other and then sending signals around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So the skin is really like causing body-wide communication. It's a very complex organ, but you can appreciate it's so important because it's our first line defense to stresses, environmental stresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: So I definitely agree with you that there are multiple things happening in an organ as complex as the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But the reason why I'm asking for more specificity about what UVB actually is doing to help produce this immune response or this dampening of immune response is because most people, when they think of ultraviolet and the body, maybe if we've heard anything about it beyond the potential for skin cancer, people have heard the skin cancer is caused because the UV damages the DNA inside your skin cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So what is happening that's actually positive inside some of the cells or whatever system you want to point to, that's actually changing it in a healthful way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: But this is the whole point. We, our bodies, if we reacted to every sort of DNA break in our skin, we wouldn't survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-pullquote breakout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-pullquote-text"&gt;We, our bodies, if we reacted to every sort of DNA break in our skin, we wouldn't survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="article-pullquote-attribution"&gt;Prue Hart&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;We have inbuilt mechanisms; we have innate immunity, where the skin has adapted to be able to cope with the initiation of what might progress to a skin cancer. We know that we don't react against it. Because otherwise we'd be responding to everything that comes and hits the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Remember bugs and viruses and scratches and all those insults of the skin, it's the same thing. We can't react to them all. We've got to dampen down our responses. So we can evolve to be in survival mode. So it's part of saying, look, the immune system, we don't want to respond. We don't want to be, have a crash and burn response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;We've really got to calm it down. And that's what we are harnessing then in treating autoimmunity. Because we know autoimmune diseases are when the body is reacting against self, and it's usually by your immune cells. Your immune cells are destroying the body. And in the case of multiple sclerosis, it's destroying the myelin sheath around nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So we've got to calm down those immune cells and say, 'Hold on, stop it.' So right at the skin level, we start developing regulatory mechanisms rather than reactive mechanisms. So if we can modify, and that's, it's all initiated or started first in the skin. And then systemically we are calming down, where there's homeostasis needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Professor Hart, if I may, you're going to have to forgive me for asking a question repeatedly, but I really do want to know in more scientific detail what we do know so far, what might be happening at the level of cells when skin is exposed to sunlight. For example, I'm reading here in the Scientific Press that says some researchers are tracking the way molecules in the skin, such as urocanic acid or lumisterol affect immune system activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Are these areas that you're studying and what are these chemicals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: Yes. Urocanic acid was first identified, oh, 40 years ago. As a molecule in the outer layers of the skin and when it absorbs UVB photons, it isomerizes from, transforms one molecular form or chemical form to another, and it's made more soluble by this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;When it's more soluble, it can then go through the skin and to our circulation and is eventually measured in the urine. Now it is a well known immunosuppressant molecule. We believe it affects antigen presenting cells, but many immune cells. So it's a molecule that has quite potentially a therapeutic benefit if it was given. The other one, lumisterol is a product from vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Now, I think all your listeners will know about vitamin D. It is one of the molecules in skin. It's precursor when it absorbs those UVB photons, that's 7-Dehydrocholesterol. When it absorbs the UVB photons, it converts to vitamin D and then goes to the kidneys and to the liver where it's converted into the fully active molecule of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Now we know vitamin D, that may be important. We do not believe it really is a very important molecule because trials of supplementation with vitamin D have suggested it is a small player relative to all the other molecules that may be made in the skin. And this is why it's a very exciting area of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The skin, as I said, is so dynamic. It's so active. It's got so many pathways stimulating each other, feeding on each other, to send signals to different parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Professor Hart, stand by for just a moment. That's Prue Hart. You're listening to her from Perth, Australia. Let's go to basically the other side of planet Earth to Edinburgh, Scotland, where Dr. Richard Weller joins us. He's a professor of medical dermatology at the University of Edinburgh. Dr. Weller, welcome to On Point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;RICHARD WELLER: Hi. Great to be here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: How sunny is it in Scotland today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;WELLER: Not. Look in Scottish terms. It's sunny. We've got a UV index of 4. I used to work in Australia actually, up in Queensland, so midwinter, in, so mid-June around the middle of the day in Queensland where I was working, the UV index is 7, it rises to 14 in summer last year. Here in Scotland, the UV index hit 7 for five minutes on the 24th of June, if you're interested. And yet ridiculously, we copy sunlight advice from Australia, completely irrelevant and more than irrelevant, actually harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But we can discuss that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Both of you're very keen to push back on the sort of accepted dermatological advice of protecting yourself from the sun. And I promise you, I will let both of you have your say about that a little bit later in the show. But as you can tell, I hope you can tell I'm very keenly interested in trying to understand the mechanisms that are behind this suggestion that increased amounts of sunlight do amazing things for our overall health and not just for like our emotional wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Dr. Weller, you're in Edinburgh, it's a pretty high latitude city on planet Earth. I've been seeing that there is actually some correlation between disease incidents and literally the latitude that you are at on the planet, vis-a-vis the amount of sun that you get. Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;WELLER: Yes, it is. And look, the first thing, look, the first thing doctors should do when talking about, why are we concerned about cigarettes? Because cigarettes shorten life. It's about four minutes per cigarette. Why are we worried about high blood pressure? Because high blood pressure shortens life. Why are we worried about poverty? Poverty shortens life. What about sunlight? Actually, what the studies from up here in Northern Europe show, and this is studies from Sweden and it's studies from here in the UK, they show that the more sunlight people get, the longer they live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Because this equation, the bad side of sunlight, skin cancer, the good side, reductions in heart disease, cancer. Which of those is more important? Actually, all-cause mortality, death from any cause, is the mathematical, it's the sum of those two things. And certainly, in Northern Europe, the more sunlight people get, the longer they live. So if you are telling people to avoid sunlight, you really need to be saying why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-pullquote breakout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-pullquote-text"&gt;In Northern Europe, the more sunlight people get, the longer they live. So if you are telling people to avoid sunlight, you really need to be saying why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="article-pullquote-attribution"&gt;Richard Weller&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Okay. And so the why, we'll come back to. But Professor Hart, I wanted to hear you on this as well. So that just to be clear, there is a body of evidence that shows that people who live further from the equator, so therefore their exposure to sunlight is much more variable depending on the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;That people living further from the equator tend to have a higher prevalence of some diseases. Is that true, Professor Hart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: Yes. Certainly, in the autoimmune diseases. In fact, any disease with an inflammatory component. I talk about Type 1 diabetes, Crohn's disease. Richard will talk about cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So really any disease with this inflammatory component that can be dampened by UV, there will be a latitude gradient. There'll be a seasonal effect. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Wow. And for this to actually have like scientific salience, it has to be on basically on a population level, right? We're not talking about individual cases, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;We're talking about overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: It's population level because we know that the environment by your genetics can combine to determine disease. But environment is a large component, and that's where the latitude gradient comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So Dr. Weller, Professor Hart earlier had talked, she's talked about repeatedly autoimmune disorders and the impact that sunlight might have on the immune system cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Can you tell me more about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;WELLER: Yeah, so look, cardiovascular health, a big effect of sunlight. So if you are male in Scotland, but I think it also applies to females, you are 30% more likely to drop dead in a week in January than a week in July. So look, it's August at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;I'm pretty mellow, safe time of year, I start to get a bit antsy towards the end of the year. This seasonal variation in disease is such, it's so built into us as the norm. If you are a doctor, it is really busy in winter and there's a kind of unspoken rule that you don't take holidays in winter, because you're all really busy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It's not a formal rule, it's just part of the culture. And we know that blood pressure very much varies by latitude. So the further people live away from the equator, the higher average blood pressure is. And with that, we have higher rates of stroke and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And then work that I've done with colleagues in Germany have also done and reproduced shows that sunlight releases this substance, nitric oxide from the skin. So when you are in the sun, NOs release from your skin. And what that does is it dilates blood vessels and lowers blood pressure, and that accounts for this huge seasonal and latitudinal variation in blood pressure. And with it, heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: ... Yeah. Oh, because I was just going to ask you, because heart disease is also one of those highly complex diseases. Where you have to talk about diet and thing and things like that as well, but you're at least seeing this very strong correlation between nitrous oxide and blood pressure though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So that's significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;WELLER: Yeah, look, so we've done experiments. I did a TED Talk some years ago if people want to see it. And we've very clearly shown that shining UV at people releases NO from the skin and it dilates blood vessels. And then we've done big observational studies in America actually looking at dialysis patients because they get their blood pressure measured three times a week when they get dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And we show that these 2,000 centers around America with different amounts of UV and temperature. And again, very clearly, we show that the more UV people are exposed to, the lower blood pressure is, but really about half of this effect is due to temperature. But about a half is just due to UV. And another important thing in this is that Black Americans get less of a fall in their blood pressure for a given rise in UV than white Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And of course, high blood pressure, strokes, heart attacks. Are particularly prevalent in Black Americans compared to white Americans. And skin color is all about handling sunlight. That's why pale skin developed as we moved away from Africa, where we all come from. And as people moved into low light environments, they develop pale skin just to soak up more of that sunlight that we need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And one of the things that it affects is blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Okay so tell me a little bit more about, is it melanin specifically that we're talking about here? Because that's the thing that provides the visual cue of skin color. But does that have, is that part of the UV system you're talking about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;WELLER: Yeah, we don't know. All we know is that, so we know looking at our African ancestors, that white skin within Africa, before humans left Africa, we know that pale skin colors were actively selected against. You can see this in the genetic patterns of skin pigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But having moved to low light environments really quite recently, in the last 5,000 to 8,000 years only, and we've been out of Africa for about 60,000 years, there was then this really very strong selective pressure over the last 8,000 years for pale skin in Northern Europe, and response to sunlight is determined by skin color. UV induced skin cancer is purely a disease of white skinned, North European heritage people. And, but at the same time, there is less of that healthy fall in blood pressure with darker skin types, less rise in vitamin D, which is a good biomarker for biological effects of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Skin color gives us an indication that sunlight has to have benefits. Because repeatedly as people have moved to low light environments, pale skin has developed to try and make up for that lack of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Interesting. Professor Hart, did you want to add to that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: I'd like to just say I support everything there. I agree that we've evolved so that we can get the benefits of sun. The paler skin allows more of the photons to hit the important cells in the skin without the melanin barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But I'd also just like to add that this observational study of, as people live higher from the equator at higher latitudes, as populations. There are other studies that send the same message. There's a lot of cohort studies that have been performed around the world, so cohort studies is where people study 50,000 people or that sort of number, and usually the healthier people are those with skin cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So that is telling us, yes, the skin is reacting and developing some skin cancers, some usually non-melanoma skin cancers, but they're healthier. Their cardiovascular health is better, and that's also sending us a message, that's just from natural observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Can I come back to something about vitamin D. Because I've failed to I think understand completely what both of what you were saying. And actually Dr. Weller, let me turn to you on this. People take a lot of vitamin D supplements, and as I think Professor Hart said earlier, that in and of itself may not actually be doing you any good. That it's vitamin D produced, what, out of the skin by exposure to sunlight. That's actually the beneficial one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Can you give me your take on that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;WELLER: Yeah, no. Look sunlight hitting the skin makes vitamin D. So measured vitamin D in your blood tells you how much sunlight you've been exposed to. We know that people with high measured vitamin D in their blood are healthier in every way. You can say less heart disease, less cancer, less diabetes, less obese, live longer, et cetera, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The problem is when you give, correlation is not causation, is the classic thing when you give people vitamin D supplements. And in America, you ran this huge study called the VITAL study run out of Boston. 25,000 Americans given, half of them given vitamin D for five years, half given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;They didn't know which it was, all the results reported in the New England Journal. And basically, it came out vitamin D does pretty much nothing. There was some reduction in some autoimmune diseases and that was it. Now that is a huge study and the results came back negative. So what this is telling us is it's not the vitamin D, it's something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Vitamin D is a marker for sunlight exposure. And the problem with the debate for the last hundred years is that it's been dominated by dermatologists saying, oh, sunlight will call skin cancer. Terrible. And any benefits can be reproduced by taking Vitamin D, and that's wrong. Vitamin D prevents rickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But very clearly, in a great editorial in the New England Journal about two years ago, 30% of Americans over the age of 60 take vitamin D supplements. And other than rickets and a few little fringe autoimmune disease, it doesn't do much. It's not the vitamin D, it's the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part III&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Professor Hart, we had mentioned multiple sclerosis a couple of times here, and I just wanted to quickly ask you about some data that has been coming out over several years from Australia itself because huge country, lots of different latitudes. So variable sunlight exposure within Australia itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Excellent medical record keeping. And I'm seeing here that there have been several studies that show a correlation between the incidents of multiple sclerosis and the latitude at which various Australians live. It's a fairly strong correlation and that feels quite remarkable to me. Professor Hart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: I think this is wonderful data. It shows quite clearly that in the southern parts of Australia, such as Hobart, there is five to sevenfold greater prevalence of multiple sclerosis than up in North Queensland, near the tropics. So I think this is really, it's happening naturally. It's showing us that it's a real thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;That the UV exposure, sunlight exposure, can actually dampen the initiation, the progression, the development of multiple sclerosis, such that if you get exposure to less UV down in the southern parts of Australia, you have more disease. And we've taken this a step further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Oh. I was just going to ask you about that because my first question that came up when I was reading about these sort of population wide studies in Australia, was correlation doesn't equal causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;There may be other things going on at different latitudes in Australia, but you did follow up research in a much more controlled manner. Can you tell me about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: We've done a study giving narrowband UVB to patients with the earliest form of MS. Now this was important, because we know dermatologists give narrowband UVB to treat skin conditions, we were trying to give it to patients with such that it had internal benefits. And it was not difficult to get through ethics committees, because it's so safe to give narrowband UVB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It's wavelengths of UVB that have had no effect on skin cancer induction at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So we did a study of 20 patients, 10 got the narrowband UVB. 10 did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: With the light box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: With a light box, three times a week for eight weeks. And we followed the patients for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;After 12 months, all of those who got the placebo light developed multiple sclerosis. Those who were given narrowband, only 70% developed multiple sclerosis within 12 months. So this was a huge effect. 30% reduction in the conversion from the very earliest forms of multiple sclerosis to full-blown disease, and this is what we need to work on further, we need to be able to show this clinically more definitively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The wonderful thing is we then had a biobank of cells and blood from these participants. And we've been able to find a little bit of mechanism by which UVB might be working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Particularly through the blood. And also, the participants loved the treatment. They loved it, they felt something was being done for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;They can, now being shown that the light boxes can be given at home. So really, we think we are advancing in being able to use a component of sunlight to dampen autoimmune disease, like multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: And to be clear, these light boxes are not like tanning beds, right? They're different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: No. They're narrowband UVB. The dermatologists have been using them for decades, and as I said, they're now so safe. The health funds in the U.S., Kaiser Permanente is supporting them for use at home. Not in a clinic, but at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Okay. Professor Hart and Dr. Weller. Hang on here for just a second, because by this point in the show, I know that many dermatologists, especially in the United States, are probably ready to scream at me because of their profound concerns about excessive sunlight exposure on the skin. So to that point, we did speak with Dr. Veena Vanchinathan. She's a board-certified dermatologist who practices in the San Francisco Bay Area, and she's a member of the American Academy of Dermatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;VEENA VANCHINATHAN: My opinion as a dermatologist is that minimizing sun exposure as much as possible is ideal. Bring your sunscreen with you as much as you can, bring your hat with you, and that will go a really long way at preventing you from developing skin cancer or those signs of premature skin aging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-pullquote breakout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-pullquote-text"&gt;My opinion as a dermatologist is that minimizing sun exposure as much as possible is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="article-pullquote-attribution"&gt;Dr. Veena Vanchinathan&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Vanchinathan says that, yes, the sun feels good and it's impossible to avoid sunshine completely, but she in her opinion, those small amounts of exposure over time really do add up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;VANCHINATHAN: So five minutes walking your dog or 10 minutes walking to your mailbox, driving without wearing sunscreen. Adding in a couple beach days. In general, for most Americans, harmful sun exposure isn't really coming from the 4th of July or that day at the beach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's really coming from the day-to-day cumulative effects of ignoring those five minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Dr. Vanchinathan says exposure to UVA and UVB rays from the sun can cause fine lines, wrinkles, and brown spots on the skin. And of course, the big concern is it can also cause skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;VANCHINATHAN: Data in the United States shows that approximately one in five Americans will actually develop skin cancer at some point in their lifetime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most commonly, a type of skin cancer called non-melanoma skin cancer. Those encompass two large buckets called basal-cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Those are the two most common that we're going to see that can be quite directly linked to sun exposure and our sun protection habits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: And for melanoma, it is true that rates of melanoma have been rising rapidly over the past 30 years in the United States. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, the AD estimates, some 212,000 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in 2025 alone. Vanchinathan also says the sun is strongest between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM so it's best to limit your exposure during those hours, according to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;You can check to make sure the UV index is below three or four before heading outside, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;VANCHINATHAN: It's hard to find such a clear-cut paradigm, if you will, for other cancers. Where do this, and this won't happen. And don't do that, and this cancer will develop. But we do see that with skin cancer, it's very clear that avoiding the sun and wearing sunscreen can go such a long way at preventing someone from having a really awful experience with something like melanoma or skin cancer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: That's Dr. Veena Vanchinathan. She's a board certified dermatologist in the San Francisco Bay Area. Okay, Dr. Weller, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;WELLER: Okay. Would love to. So basal-cell skin cancer is common of every other cancer put together. When you have a basal-cell skin cancer diagnosed your life expectancy goes up. I don't see that as a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Melanoma rates have increased sixfold in the United States in the last four years. That's diagnoses deaths. Have not changed. Adewole Adamson, fantastic dermatologist in Austin, Texas. Look up his stuff, published in JAMA, in the New England Journal. So in America, your biggest risk factor. So looking at diagnoses of melanoma and how sunny it is where people live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Great paper in JAMA Dermatology, pretty much no relationship. The biggest correlation between a diagnosis of melanoma is how rich you are. So the richer counties are, the more likely people are to be diagnosed with melanoma. The more biopsies are done, the more likely --&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: It's because they have better health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;I'm just going to jump in here and say ...  in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;WELLER: That's the argument. So look, if all of that health care was really effective, you would expect a fall in deaths from melanoma. There has been no change up or down, no significant change up or down in deaths from melanoma in the last 40 years, despite the huge rise in incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Dr. Weller, can I jump in here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;WELLER: Yes, come in with the counter argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Not necessarily a counter argument, but just make this a little more complex. Death is not the only negative outcome from having, from melanoma, right? So just the change in the death rate is not a good enough reason to say the increased diagnoses have not been effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;WELLER: Look, I think not being dead is the most important endpoint. I'm agnostic about what I don't die of, whether I don't die of being struck by lightning. Don't die of skin cancer, don't die of heart disease. I really don't care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;I just don't want to be dead, and I am interested in factors, exposures that reduce my risk of death. And certainly, here in Northern Europe, the more sunlight I get, very markedly, the lower my risks of dying. So we are about to publish a paper. We had one last year, another one out here, and in the UK Biobank, this huge, great, forward-looking study of half million people in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Which has got very good data on how much sunlight exposure people got, and also education, income, smoking, exercise, et cetera, et cetera. We find that if you reduce sun exposure, for a British cohort, enough to reduce one death from skin cancer, that associates with 50 extra deaths from other causes. Now look, that may not apply directly in America, because you're a lot further south than us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But the risk benefit ratio is enormously in favor of sunlight exposure in Northern Europe. And I suspect to a lesser degree that will apply in America. And all dermatologists think about is the skin, and that's not good medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: Professor Hart, let me turn back to you because we've only got about three-ish minutes here remaining in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And what I'm thinking about more often, that melanoma is an important issue. I'm not going to diminish that, but we're not talking about having to go outside for 12 straight hours a day and have the sun beat down on your skin. It sounds like from this conversation that even small increases or moderate increases in sun exposure can provide some significant health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And so since you're at the Kids Research Institute in Perth, it suddenly occurred to me, I don't know if this is happening in Australia, but in the United States, there's been a growing issue over many years that kids during the school year especially, barely go outside at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Because the amount of recess that they're having is, has been, reduced. Are we seeing impacts on children's health from reduced sun exposure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: You are so correct in that. Yes. The clearest studies are with myopia and eyes for children, but yes, with Type 1 diabetes, that's a children's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In fact, we know a lot of autoimmune diseases start in childhood, may even start in utero. And yes, sun exposure is so important there, and I think Richard brought it up, it's the risk to benefit ratio. And I think dermatologists, the American dermatologists, all they think about is risks. We've really got to move that pendulum a bit more to considering the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So a little bit more sun exposure. We say never get sunburnt. Because sunburnt is the initiating event for melanoma. We just say, never get sunburnt, but certainly get sun exposure. Because that is going to be homeostatic and so good for you for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-pullquote breakout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-pullquote-text"&gt;Never get sunburnt, but certainly get sun exposure. Because that is going to be homeostatic and so good for you for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="article-pullquote-attribution"&gt;Prue Hart&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: This is really key. Get more sun exposure. Don't get burned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Okay. I have a question for you though. Depending on, maybe this is highly variable depending on each individual, but how can we measure what that threshold is between a healthy amount of sunlight, and I might be outside long enough to get burned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HART: I would say just never get sunburnt. Everyone, you have to consider your own intelligence when you're going to get sunburnt. And I think just make sure you get out a little bit every day and get a little bit more than you might have been getting up to, you'll feel better. Your energy levels will improve. Your whole-body health will improve. But never get sunburnt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;CHAKRABARTI: It's so funny. Maybe I'm just not that sun intelligent myself, but when I'm outside for a long time I do wear some sunscreen. But when I don't reapply it, sometimes I don't realize that I'm getting close to being burned until well after the fact. Maybe that's because I've got brown skin.

It is critical for hundreds of basic biochemical processes, including muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, the ability of cells to create proteins, and blood pressure regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also calms the nervous system before bed, relaxes the muscles, and helps produce the sleep hormone melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 70 million Americans &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14950975/study-link-irregular-sleep-172-diseases.html"&gt;struggle with insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, and around a quarter of Americans experience daytime sleepiness as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium has been shown in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, the research gold standard, to extend a person's time asleep, improve sleep quality, increase the concentration of melatonin, and decrease the stress hormone cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For sleep improvement, it is crucial to choose magnesium glycinate over magnesium citrate, which is a laxative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 70 million Americans struggle with insomnia. But clinical research has shown magnesium glycinate helps people sleep longer and more efficiently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended daily amount of magnesium is 320 milligrams (mg) a day for women and 420 mg a day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood tests can show whether someone is deficient in magnesium, which can lead to muscle cramps and fatigue, or more serious conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The normal range for blood magnesium is 1.7 to 2.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One fan of the supplement on Reddit said: ‘It does really improve my sleep in my own experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When I tried magnesium, it's the first time in like decades that I'm sleeping straight for like eight to nine hours. I used to sleep like six hours a day.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another person said: ‘Magnesium did wonders for my restless legs and overall capability to rest. Great stuff!’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A third added: ‘I've taken magnesium for the past five years and swear by it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people mentioned, though, that the benefits to their sleep were short-lived, with one saying: ‘It's effects wore off after doing it two nights in a row or so.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some combine it with other supplements for a boost. A commenter said she takes magnesium glycinate combined with calcium and zinc, ‘and I believe it has helped me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Magnesium glycinate calms the nervous system before bed, relaxes the muscles, and helps produce the sleep hormone melatonin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The three-part nighttime cocktail can bring out several benefits, such as enhancing muscle relaxation and melatonin synthesis, boosting GABA (which slows down brain activity), and supporting deeper sleep. The trio may also stabilize circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium glycinate is well-absorbed in the body, making it more effective, and its gentle nature on the stomach makes it a popular choice for people who struggle to fall asleep or sleep through the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2012 double-blind, randomized &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3703169/"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; suggests that magnesium supplementation may significantly improve both subjective and objective measures of insomnia in older adults, offering a potential alternative to conventional sleep medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, conducted among 46 elderly people, found that an eight-week regimen of 500 mg of magnesium daily led to notable improvements in sleep duration, efficiency, and key hormonal markers linked to sleep regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings, while they seem small, were statistically significant improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They revealed that compared to placebo, the magnesium group experienced statistically significant increases in sleep time by 0.2 percent and sleep efficiency increased by three percent, alongside reductions in sleep onset latency by two percent and insomnia severity scores down by 0.06 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Biomarkers such as serum renin, an enzyme that helps regulate blood pressure, and melatonin rose significantly, by more than 0.1 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cortisol levels associated with wakefulness declined significantly by 0.8 percent, suggesting that magnesium plays a dual role in modulating both brain chemical pathways and the body’s circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Getting too little sleep, generally considered to be fewer than seven hours, contributes to several health issues, including bloating, brittle nails, overeating, diabetes, and poor skin. It can also leave people with too little energy to exercise and be active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Past research has shown that ghrelin, a hormone promoting hunger, increases with insufficient sleep, while leptin, a hormone contributing to satiety perception, decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor sleep hygiene has also been linked to inflammation in the body, which can spur the growth of cancer cells, and a higher risk of heart attack or stroke, dementia, and autoimmune disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 18:46:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQWG5Mc1p1ZDdXR3puaUhpYjk4aThrSlpDNldNdzM5TkJhYTlJZThrOWxlX01qQTA1U2l3UlJKZkROOEdBRUQ1SVpPdFVodFpaYWU4bUEtYzdFMHFfUlJmaVE0VTVNX2JWbzVpQm11TkxvVGJsbEVzc0pjQWVXWVM1dWZJbkpUZ2tMSGo2VXpkbjlPZmhxUFdRcHdXRzlVS05TSlFqS0dYbjVOMEdoNExrOWJB0gG3AUFVX3lxTFBkSklWanpfVl9BbDJ3UEZ1SzVjVkVVeG1vb1pBTkRpMFgxN2ZWSlFHQWZHbjI5cFQyOEZTclBnc05udjNDbW03ZmhKQlZ6ZFc0bUtoelhFM3dJV1FiRlN6dHVSYzlITWZXRlU0Nzg5YWwtMDFCWXpSRVd4anQxbi1ia01qTUp5amljclJlOThRRl9aMnBTdWVKb2FRWHhIaUhteGZNdUo0UzA5ejhmQUhzMFhtcjI5Zw</guid></item></channel></rss>
