But that’s not all. Depending on the specific vaccine we’re talking about, that jab might also prevent cancer, heal herpes lesions, help you keep most of your marbles, prevent your kids from dying in early childhood, improve your skin and so much more. These surprising bonuses that can come with vaccination, called beneficial non-specific effects, are common, but not widely understood. In fact, no one knew about them until relatively recently — and when researchers first discovered all this, no one believed them at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we look at that, let’s consider just how good these non-specific effects can get. Well, the Shingrix (or Zoster vaccine recombinant) vaccine, which is recommended for all adults in later middle age, prevents up to 95 percent of shingles cases. But that’s not all. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;It also reduces your risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, with a 20 percent relative risk reduction over seven years. (Shingles is the long-term result of a childhood chicken pox infection, which can hide inside you for decades before re-emerging in notoriously painful fashion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Martin, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, told Salon in a video interview that certain viruses, like the herpes group — which includes the chicken pox virus and the one that causes cold sores, as well as genital herpes — “are notorious for these reactivation and latency patterns, and  changing your health status over the long term based on how much they’re around and active in your body.” It seems that the Shingrix vaccine’s remarkable effect on rates of dementia in older adults is the result of preventing some of those health status changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the shingles vaccine does is it dampens reactivations of latent viruses in a way that may be protecting other parts of your body,” Martin said. Including, it seems, the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella or MMR vaccine protects children against those three diseases, of course. (Two doses are 97 percent effective against measles, for example). But that’s not all. It also reduces &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37482223/"&gt;your child’s all-cause mortality&lt;/a&gt; — that is, their risk of dying of any cause, for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral polio vaccine prevents — surprise! — polio. But that’s not all. Vaccinating a newborn baby within its first two days &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4614411/"&gt;reduces their risk of dying&lt;/a&gt; in their first year by 10 to 62 percent, while also reducing the risk of flu, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35711442/"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9196174/"&gt;bacterial diarrhea and otitis media, among other infections&lt;/a&gt;, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines currently in development for Staphylococcus aureus infections, including MRSA, might have the side effect of &lt;a href="https://thesecretlifeofskin.com/2023/10/12/vaccines-skin-microbiome-and-skin-diseases/"&gt;fighting atopic dermatitis, cellulitis and impetigo — maybe even acne.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constantly hear from public health officials about how we should get vaccines because it’s good for us, like flossing our teeth. In the U.S., rather obviously, the public health message has gotten more confused of late. We constantly hear from pseudoscience grifters and bleach-drinking advocates that we shouldn’t get vaccines because, well, because of a bunch of hooey. So why isn’t anyone telling us about these remarkable side effects of vaccination? If you were trying to sell a product that not only keeps you healthy when other people are getting sick with, say, chicken pox, but also prevents you from getting a painful and potentially damaging disease many years later, wouldn’t you want to advertise that? Because that thing would sell like gangbusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constantly hear from pseudoscience grifters and bleach-drinking advocates that we shouldn’t get vaccines because, well, because of a bunch of hooey. Why isn’t anyone telling us about the remarkable side effects of vaccination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the numbers don’t lie. Mind you, this is science we’re talking about, and there’s an important distinction between noticing an association and confirming a causal connection. So what’s the cause? By what mechanism do vaccines do so much unexpected good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are “basically two ways” of understanding these “off-target effects,” Martin said. “One way of looking at it is that the disease the vaccine is preventing is actually causing a wider range of illnesses and issues than we ever realized before we started vaccinating.” she explained. Influenza, which can cause falls and cognitive status issues in older people during acute infection and recovery, offers a classic example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But then, if you look at something like measles,” Martin continued, “those other effects are giant.” Measles is distinctive in that it essentially goes into a person’s system and wipes out the T-cells — a vital part of the immune response — gained during previous infections of other kinds. “Any of the lived experience that you’ve had to build up antibodies against infection then gets wiped out by the measles virus. When you recover from a live measles infection … you’ve just lost all of your immunity. It’ll be like you’re a kid in day care for the first time. So you’re going to be encountering all of these diseases with very little prior immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the beneficial non-specific effect of measles vaccination, then, derives from preventing a disease whose &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/11/you-dont-want-to-throw-a-measles-party/"&gt;health impacts are more serious and long-term&lt;/a&gt; than scientists originally understood. But there’s a further effect, believed to relate to another phenomenon called trained immunity. That’s what happens when activating an organism’s innate or built-in immunity can result in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7186935/"&gt;later revved-up response to a new immune challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of the effects of various vaccines, Martin said, suggest that the “mild, low-level replication” of a pathogen — which is how most vaccines work — can result in “training the immune system” to protect you against other diseases. Peter Aaby, a Danish anthropologist, discovered the beneficial non-specific effects of vaccines while working in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau after it gained independence in the 1970s. As in many other poor countries, Guinea-Bissau’s extremely high child mortality, which meant more than half of all children died before age 5, was attributed by mostly Western scientists and policymakers to malnutrition. But when Aaby’s team conducted a survey of 1,200 children, they found that malnourishment was virtually nonexistent. Just after that survey was completed, a severe measles epidemic swept the area, killing one-fourth of all children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So malnutrition no longer made sense as the “explanation of severe child mortality,” Aaby told Salon in a video interview. “The stunning thing was, there was no relationship. The nutritional status of the children who died of measles was not different from those who survived.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he had a hard time getting the Swedish research organization that had hired him, or other medical authorities who reviewed his work, to address the implications of the data. He eventually tested a new hypothesis: It wasn’t nutritional status that determined how bad a case of measles was, but rather how intensely a child had been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those most likely to die, Aaby found, were “the children who are infected inside the home.” When many children lived under the same roof, he explained, they were likely to be exposed to far greater doses of the virus. “That turned out to be by far the strongest explanation of measles mortality,” he said. “I have also subsequently shown that the same pattern applies not just to measles, but [also] for chicken pox, RSV, polio and whooping cough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaby’s team then went door to door providing measles vaccinations, and a few years later he received a follow-up report, describing what happened to children who had been involved in the study and subsequent ones carried out in rural areas. “I got the idea that maybe measles vaccine had an impact on child survival,” he said. And sure enough, “nearly every time that someone had died [of any cause], they had not been vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of the effects of various vaccines, Martin said, suggest that the “mild, low-level replication” of a pathogen — which is how most vaccines work — can result in “training the immune system” to protect you against other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later studies from several countries with data on childhood mortality before and after introduction of the measles vaccine likewise showed a minimum 50% reduction in mortality among children under age 5 — “an unbelievable effect,” as Aaby put it. Children who had previously survived a measles infection had even lower risks of mortality: It’s fair to say that what didn’t kill them did indeed make them stronger, but at a terrible risk, since a quarter of measles-infected children did not survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other vaccines were likewise shown to reduce childhood mortality, without the risks associated with infection, and to an astonishing degree: the BCG vaccine (against tuberculosis) did so by 45%, for example. Aaby’s findings  were initially dismissed, since he was an anthropologist with no medical credentials  (he now has a PhD in medicine), but no longer. In 2016 the WHO noted the otherwise inexplicable effects of BCG and measles vaccines on childhood mortality, while in 2020 the widely-respected journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00018-3"&gt;Nature included non-specific effects in a list of&lt;/a&gt; “milestones in vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Child mortality under age 5 has declined by 86 percent, and there is no way you can explain it by controlling measles and whooping cough and tuberculosis,” Aaby emphasized to Salon. “It’s the immune stimulation that we have provided” through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the protection vaccines provide against a specific pathogen — we need boosters for COVID-19 because the vaccine’s effects wane over time — this enhanced general immune protection may last for just a few months or endure for years, as with the effect of measles vaccination on overall health. Early findings show that existing COVID vaccines may also offer beneficial non-specific effects in similar fashion, as Aaby suggests in a PowerPoint presentation he shared with Salon, by revving up our immune systems against other pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this amounts to saying that vaccines have no risks, or even that their non-specific effects are always beneficial. Aaby found, for example, that what’s known as the high-titer measles vaccine, when given to very young children, was later associated with increased mortality for girls, a finding of sex differences in immune response that has been seen with other vaccines as well. (That specific vaccine is no longer in use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research revealed that it was the sequence in which vaccines were administered, not the vaccines themselves, that was responsible for higher mortality. Changing the sequence of vaccines, usually by giving live vaccines before non-live ones, maximizes the beneficial effect and removes that additional risk for girls, apparently by programming the innate immune system in a better way. Aaby is now testing whether combining live and non-live vaccines may reduce negative effects while maintaining beneficial effects, both the specific protection against a given infection and the non-specific strengthening of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s essential to evaluate the benefits and risks of any vaccine carefully, of course. But too often, public attention is fixated on rare and unlikely negative side effects when the overall protection offered by a vaccine far outweighs any statistical risk. Unless you are a person with known risk factors involving bad outcomes, you’re almost certainly at greater risk by not getting a given vaccine. Epidemiologists and public health researchers are supposed to crunch the numbers and figure these things out, and to adjust recommendations as new findings come in, especially recommendations about what vaccines children need, and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many experts in the field, Martin is concerned that HHS Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s recent dismissal&lt;/a&gt; of the entire CDC panel of vaccine experts who do that, and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430870/cdc-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr"&gt;their replacement with known vaccine “skeptics”&lt;/a&gt; or outright opponents&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430870/cdc-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; puts that at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="top_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, public attention is fixated on rare and unlikely negative side effects. Unless you are a person with known risk factors involving bad outcomes, you’re almost certainly at greater risk by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; getting a given vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I worry what data they are going to use,” Martin said. “if they are not acknowledging the data that’s there and being generated. It is ready for them to review right now. This is an ongoing process that we’re always iterating on, every year, putting out vaccine data” to guide policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High child mortality was taken for granted for centuries. So what happened? In a word, vaccines happened. Anyone who visits an older cemetery anywhere in North America is startled to see the large numbers of tombstones inscribed with the names of infants and young children. Such deaths are relatively rare on our continent today, but Aaby’s work suggests that this dramatic change is not purely due to the prevention of the specific diseases targeted by vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, he contends, the “enormous reduction we’ve had in [child] mortality in low-income countries in the last 30 or 40 years” can only be explained by the non-specific effects he has documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaby and his colleagues have followed populations before and after the oral polio vaccine campaigns that began in 1995 and ended in roughly 2015 in various low-income countries such as Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, Bangladesh and Uganda. They determined that childhood mortality overall was roughly 25% lower after the campaign than before. Add to that similar effects from BCG and measles vaccination, and we have, Aaby says, an explanation for the dramatic decline in childhood mortality in many such countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major reason why the U.S. and Western Europe have seen dramatic population increase over the last 200-plus years, Aaby says, is the introduction of the smallpox vaccine in 1800. That wasn’t just that vaccine prevented one specific and often deadly disease, he argues, but because of the vaccine’s overall effect on immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of things that we’ve forgotten to say” to vaccine-hesitant parents concerned about rare negative effects, said Martin, largely “because measles infection in the United States has been so incredibly rare for the last 30 years.” In other words, at a cultural level we have simply forgotten how common, and how serious, the long-term damage  from exposure to measles and other diseases used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think people in other countries who have had endemic measles understand that more acutely than we do,” Martin said. In many such countries, people have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-025-01143-8"&gt;high confidence in vaccination&lt;/a&gt; despite less reliable access to vaccines, and the reverse is also true, with people in higher-income countries expressing greater vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there’s evidence to suggest it may have been a mistake to stop administering the smallpox vaccine after the total elimination of smallpox, or to end the BCG vaccine as tuberculosis infection became rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large Danish study compared children who received the BCG and smallpox vaccines to a cohort that did not. Over nearly 40 years, researchers have found that those who received either vaccine as children had &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/2/695/2622844"&gt;significantly lower risks of dying of natural causes&lt;/a&gt; — not just in childhood but clear into their 40s, which was as far as the data followed them. Just because certain diseases are eliminated, Aaby argues, is not necessarily a good reason to remove the relevant vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these almost magical-seeming but real and meaningful effects of vaccines, Martin was dismayed to see experts like the highly qualified and vetted CDC vaccine panel members dismissed by Kennedy and accused, without evidence, of conflicts of interest. “This is work that people are doing because they think it’s important,” she said. “They’re not getting any financial benefit. It was jarring to see it swapped out so quickly like that.”&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-20-12646/Exhibit1708282020.pdf"&gt;Speedballing&lt;/a&gt;—the practice of combining a stimulant like cocaine or methamphetamine with an opioid such as heroin or fentanyl—has evolved from a niche subculture to a widespread public health crisis. The practice &lt;a href="https://scottsdalerecovery.com/the-origins-of-speedballing-mixing-heroin-cocaine/"&gt;stems from the early 1900s,&lt;/a&gt; when World War I soldiers were often treated with a combination of cocaine and morphine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once associated with high-profile figures like &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/article/john-belushis-final-drug-filled-nights-in-nyc-before-his-death/"&gt;John Belushi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/scandal/2013/10/river-phoenix-overdose-dan-aykroyd"&gt;River Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/03/us/chris-farley-s-death-laid-to-drug-overdose.html"&gt;Chris Farley&lt;/a&gt;, this dangerous polysubstance use has become a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16318"&gt;leading cause of overdose deaths&lt;/a&gt; across the United States since the early- to mid-2010s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am an assistant professor of public health who has written extensively on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14659891.2020.1760380"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2020.1747478"&gt;opioid use&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2024.10.012"&gt;dangerous combination of the two&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. As these dangerous combinations of drugs increasingly flood the market, I see an urgent need and opportunity for a new approach to prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why speedballing?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dating back to the 1970s, the term speedballing originally referred to the combination of heroin and cocaine. Combining stimulants and opioids—the former’s “rush” with the latter’s calming effect—creates a dangerous physiological conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates"&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;, stimulant-involved overdose fatalities increased markedly from more than 12,000 annually in 2015 to greater than 57,000 in 2022, a 375% increase. Notably, approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm"&gt;70% of stimulant-related overdose deaths in 2022&lt;/a&gt; also involved fentanyl or other synthetic opioids, reflecting the rising prevalence of polysubstance involvement in overdose mortality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Users &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01969.x"&gt;sought to experience the euphoric “rush”&lt;/a&gt; from the stimulant and the calming effects of the opioid. However, with the &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/fentanyl"&gt;proliferation of fentanyl—&lt;/a&gt;which is far more potent than heroin—this combination has become increasingly lethal. Fentanyl is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2023.110985"&gt;often mixed with cocaine or methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes without the user’s knowledge, leading to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2022.307212"&gt;unintentional overdoses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The rise in speedballing is part of a broader trend of polysubstance use in the U.S. Since 2010, overdoses involving both stimulants and fentanyl have increased &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/overdose-deaths-fentanyl-laced-stimulants-have-risen-50-fold?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;50-fold&lt;/a&gt;, now accounting for approximately 35,000 deaths annually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This has been called the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2024.307948"&gt;fourth wave of the opioid epidemic&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354919887741"&gt;toxic and contaminated drug supply&lt;/a&gt; has exacerbated this crisis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A dangerous combination of physiological effects&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stimulants like cocaine &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.85.2.407"&gt;increase heart rate and blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2012.02307.x"&gt;opioids suppress respiratory function&lt;/a&gt;. This combination can lead to respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, and death. People who use both substances are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14506-w"&gt;more than twice as likely&lt;/a&gt; to experience a fatal overdose compared with those using opioids alone.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The conflicting effects of stimulants and opioids can also exacerbate mental health issues. Users may experience heightened &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000069"&gt;anxiety, depression,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0000000000001417"&gt;paranoia&lt;/a&gt;. The combination can also impair cognitive functions, leading to confusion and poor decision-making.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speedballing can also lead to severe cardiovascular problems, including &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/citation/1991/03000/speedballs__a_new_cause_of_intraoperative.20.aspx"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01601.x"&gt;heart attack,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-012-0325-0"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;. The strain on the heart and blood vessels from the stimulant, combined with the depressant effects of the opioid, increases the risk of these life-threatening conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Addressing the crisis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increasing awareness about the dangers of speedballing is crucial. I believe that &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/overdose-prevention/harm-reduction"&gt;educational campaigns&lt;/a&gt; can inform the public about the risks of combining stimulants and opioids and the potential for unintentional fentanyl exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a great need for better &lt;a href="https://www.apaservices.org/advocacy/news/samhsa-guidelines-substance-use"&gt;access to treatment for people with stimulant use ddisorder—a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ifeet.org/files/DSM-5-TR.pdf"&gt;condition defined as&lt;/a&gt; the continued use of amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, or other stimulants leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, from mild to severe. Treatments for this and &lt;a href="https://cureaddictionnow.org/cure-addiction-now-bridges-funding-gap-in-addiction-treatments/"&gt;other substance use disorders are underfunded&lt;/a&gt; and less accessible than those for opioid use disorder. Addressing this gap can help reduce the prevalence of speedballing.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Implementing harm reduction strategies by public health officials, community organizations, and health care providers, such as providing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000001321"&gt;fentanyl test strips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2020.306124"&gt;naloxone&lt;/a&gt;—a medication that reverses opioid overdoses—can&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/fda-approval-of-over-the-counter-narcan-is-an-important-step-in-the-effort-to-combat-the-us-opioid-crisis-198497"&gt; save lives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These measures allow individuals to test their drugs for the presence of fentanyl and have immediate access to overdose-reversing medication. Implementing these strategies widely is crucial to reducing overdose deaths and improving community health outcomes.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257425/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/andrew-yockey-2372763"&gt;Andrew Yockey&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Public Health, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-mississippi-2400"&gt;University of Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;.

Existing treatments, like cochlear implants, don't fully restore a patient's hearing, and require that the cochlea — the center piece of the inner ear that picks up sound and turns it into electrical signals — isn't significantly damaged to begin with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key to the cochlea's function are the hair cells that line its surface, which are responsible for detecting sound. If these are severely damaged, it's game over: the hair cells are incapable of dividing to form new ones, meaning that they don't regenerate. This is called sensorineural hearing loss, and it's why your hearing inevitably worsens with age. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Attempts to regrow these receptors have long been the white whale of modern medical science, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the researchers hope they've found it in Rincell-1. The treatment uses embryonic stem cells designed to grow into auditory neuron cells, which form the wiring that connect&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt; the hair cells to the brain stem. These are administered into the cochlea during the surgery to emplace the cochlear implants. Once on site, the stem cells form auditory neurons that help reconnect the out-of-commission hair cells so they can send signals again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We are taking the approach of transplanting in cells that can become functional mature cells and restore the cytoarchitecture of the inner ear, and therefore, restore hearing," Simon Chandler, CEO of Rinri Therapeutics, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.labiotech.eu/in-depth/stem-cell-therapy-hearing-disorders/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Labiotech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on an episode of its "Beyond Biotech" podcast in June.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The randomized trial will be conducted in the UK and will involve 20 patients who will undergo cochlear implant surgery. Half of the patients will have severe-to-profound age-related hearing loss, known as presbycusis, and the remainder will have what's known as auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD), which is when the inner ear can detect sound but is unable to send the signals to the brain. Patients within each group will be randomly assigned to either receive a single dose of Rincell-1, or receive no dose and rely on the cochlear implant alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the podcast, Chandler said that the Rincell-1 treatment can be used alongside cochlear implants, but didn't rule out the possibility that it would be used on its own, too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Needless to say, it'd be a game-changer if it turns out to be effective in either scenario.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on stem cells: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/diabetic-woman-stem-cells-insulin" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Diabetic Woman No Longer Needs Insulin After Single Dose of Experimental Stem Cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 12:15:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9INVdIcTVlM1lKZUpWc3doMWJXX2Z0dDVBcHB0YjdfYW9WWEYzM3llZ05sVlZFb295X1Y1el9vWUozQ3ZFTHFzRW9fV052SmYtNUZ0VUM4VFVUOHQtTThjMWNOVGpGaUdjMThPZ3JPRVpyQQ</guid></item><item><title>随着美国官员瞄准mRNA疫苗，癌症研究的“巨大不确定性” -卫报 | ‘Tremendous uncertainty’ for cancer research as US officials target mRNA vaccines - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQb3gtVW5FUWM0MzhqU2ViR3RtZHNnNHlPeUFmX3gwSGpZZDZ2b2FFeVlzUW9pWHRmNWlTUS1ac3R4Q3Y4VnZfaGxuYUc1S0Jid05jam1hS2RMa1dBM0hlSlVScUJEWFBaNS1EUjR5VFItU3ViY2o5RVFQQkpDRTRLd3J5R1pRbzQ4TU5jYlpwSGZqVURoMDJVb1dZeV9tdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As US regulators restrict Covid mRNA vaccines and as independent vaccine advisers re-examine the shots, scientists fear that an unlikely target could be next: cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines have shown promise in treating and preventing cancers that have often been difficult to address, such as pancreatic cancer, brain tumors and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"us-news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/trump-administration","type":"Keyword","title":"Trump administration"},{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/vaccines","type":"Keyword","title":"Vaccines and immunisation"},{"id":"us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr","type":"Keyword","title":"Robert F Kennedy Jr"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"us-news/us-politics","type":"Keyword","title":"US politics"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"campaign/email/the-stakes-us-election-edition","type":"Campaign","title":"This Week in Trumpland"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/melody-schreiber","type":"Contributor","title":"Melody Schreiber"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-news","type":"Tracking","title":"US News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"us-news/2025/jul/12/mrna-vaccine-cancer-research-trump-administration","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But groundbreaking research could stall as federal and state officials &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/mrna-vaccines-trump-rfk-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;target mRNA shots&lt;/a&gt;, including ending federal funding for bird flu mRNA vaccines, restricting who may receive existing mRNA vaccines and, in some places, proposing laws against the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;

And a small study co-authored by Sayour on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867424003982?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; showed the vaccines started affecting the tumors within 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Like any vaccine, mRNA cancer vaccines train the body to recognize and destroy harmful cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unlike foreign pathogens, such as infectious diseases, cancer is caused by the growth of the patient’s own cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some cancer vaccines are highly personalized, using a patient’s own cancer cells to treat their tumors or train their immune system to kill off those dangerous cells if they recur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The ability to create specific vaccines for patients has tremendous, tremendous promise, but that was technology not possible five or 10 years ago,” said Sasson. “It really is a shift in the paradigm of how we treat cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers are also investigating vaccines that would target cancer cells more broadly by identifying “fingerprints” of certain cancers, said Sayour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Additionally, the vaccines could be created for other conditions, such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It has potential to get rid of a lot of the chronic morbidity we see from disease, to cure diseases that are degenerative, to overcome cancer evolution and cure patients,” Sayour said. “mRNA could be the healthcare that the movable-type printing press was for human knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet federal and state decision-makers have targeted mRNA vaccines in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Vinay Prasad, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-shots-fda-trump-kennedy-fda-overruled-3ac51f93225aa5f20d5840468fff8b02" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/02/health/fda-covid-vaccines-prasad" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;overrode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/health/fda-covid-vaccines.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Tk8.8Vg-.OB4eDrjDIBEu&amp;amp;smid=url-share" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; at the agency to limit some Covid vaccines, including a new mRNA shot from Moderna, to children older than 12. Prasad also introduced similar limitations on the Covid shot from Novavax, which does not use mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On Thursday, the FDA approved the original Covid mRNA vaccine from Moderna for children between the ages of six months and 11 years – but they narrowed its use to children with at least one underlying condition. (The vaccine for people older than 12 was approved in 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prasad argued, in two memos recently released by the FDA, that the risks of Covid had dropped, while “known and unknown” side-effects could outweigh the benefits of getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Covid remains a leading cause of death in the US, with &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;178 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the week ending 7 June, the last week for which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers complete data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the meeting of the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) in June, two of the new vaccine advisers – appointed by the health and human services (HHS) secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, after he fired the previous 17 advisers – broached the safety of Covid mRNA vaccines, indicating future scrutiny of these shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Vicky Pebsworth, a registered nurse who has volunteered for years with the National Vaccine Information Center, said she was “very concerned” about side-effects from the Covid mRNA shots and asked for more data on safety, including “reproductive toxicity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Shortly before being appointed to the ACIP, Pebsworth and the founder of the National Vaccine Information Center &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/05/vicky-pebsworth-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that the FDA should not recommend mRNA Covid-19 shots for anyone “until adequate scientific evidence demonstrates safety and effectiveness for both the healthy and those who are elderly or chronically ill”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the June ACIP meeting, Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said he believed mRNA side-effects were “being reported at rates that are far exceeding other vaccines even when you normalize to the number of doses, which does suggest something, I think”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-30" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/dec/10/robert-f-kennedy-jr/no-covid-19-vaccine-not-deadliest-vaccine-ever-mad/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; Covid shots the “deadliest vaccine ever made”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In May, Kennedy changed Covid vaccine recommendations from “should” to “may” for children, and eliminated the recommendation for pregnant women entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Also in May, the US canceled $766m in contracts for research on mRNA vaccines against H5N1 bird flu. Investment in the mRNA vaccine was not “scientifically or ethically justifiable”, Andrew Nixon, the HHS communications director, said in &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/06/hhs-misleads-on-mrna-vaccine-safety-after-pulling-moderna-funding/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;statements&lt;/a&gt; to the media, adding that the “mRNA technology remains under-tested”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Millions of mRNA vaccines have been given around the world, and the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in multiple studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bans or limitations on mRNA vaccinations have been introduced in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seven states&lt;/a&gt;. One such bill in &lt;a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/billbookmark/?yr=2025&amp;amp;bn=S1036" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; sought to pause “gene therapy immunizations” for 10 years – a category in which they incorrectly place Covid vaccines, and which could affect other therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Similarly, in Washington state, commissioners in Franklin county passed a &lt;a href="https://franklincowa.portal.civicclerk.com/event/350/files/attachment/2292" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; urging the local health facility to stop providing and promoting gene-therapy vaccines; they also incorrectly included Covid mRNA shots in this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s this scorched-earth mentality now, but I’m hopeful that once the dust settles, we’ll be able to reinstate or allow vaccine work for cancer purposes to proceed,” Sasson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cancer is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;second leading&lt;/a&gt; cause of death in the US, and &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/all.html#:~:text=Approximately%2039.3%20percent" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two in five people&lt;/a&gt; will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There are currently only two FDA-approved vaccines that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9794995/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prevent&lt;/a&gt; cancer – hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV) – and both have been targeted by anti-vaccine activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In January, Trump hosted the launch of Stargate AI at the White House. The project could eventually identify cancers and develop mRNA vaccines in days, Larry Ellison, the chair of the tech company Oracle who is involved with the project, said at the launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The project will be funded by private, not federal, dollars, but the work on cancer would draw upon research on cancer and mRNA, among other fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; has slashed other critical funding for cancer research, prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The administration canceled more than &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/cancer-research-trump-nci-cuts-plan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$180m in grants&lt;/a&gt; through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the first three months of its term, and proposed cutting $2.7bn from the cancer center in the next NIH budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The administration has cut back funding for some family planning providers, which frequently offer screenings for HPV and other cancer markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lawmakers have also made enormous cuts to Medicaid and insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which could mean uninsured and underinsured people wait longer for cancer treatment – or forgo it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s the potential for great harm, for massive public health issues to be set aside during this really broad approach of canceling research,” said Sasson. “There’s significant harm that’s going to happen by these sweeping changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For scientists who still have funding or those who are entering the field, “there’s tremendous uncertainty as to what the future will look like”, Sasson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But he is optimistic that mRNA vaccines for cancer and other illnesses will be able to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Scientists are often portrayed as “just trying to survive” funding cuts, but that’s not entirely accurate, said Sayour, before adding: “I don’t think many people in my field do this because they’re just trying to survive. I would want nothing more, honest to God, than to put myself out of business. We do this because we want to make a difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sayour echoed concerns about both indirect and direct forces shaping progress on mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But I also want to be optimistic that our best days are ahead of us,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQb3gtVW5FUWM0MzhqU2ViR3RtZHNnNHlPeUFmX3gwSGpZZDZ2b2FFeVlzUW9pWHRmNWlTUS1ac3R4Q3Y4VnZfaGxuYUc1S0Jid05jam1hS2RMa1dBM0hlSlVScUJEWFBaNS1EUjR5VFItU3ViY2o5RVFQQkpDRTRLd3J5R1pRbzQ4TU5jYlpwSGZqVURoMDJVb1dZeV9tdw</guid></item><item><title>一名13岁的孩子胸痛。一种罕见的疾病意味着他“接近心脏性猝死。" - CBS新闻 | A 13-year-old had chest pains.

    &lt;p&gt;When Dr. Brittany Clayborne's 13-year-old son Micah came home from school in December 2023, she asked him if he wanted to play football outside. It was one of his favorite hobbies. But Micah said he couldn't. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said, 'My chest hurts,'" Clayborne recalled. "I was like, 'What do you mean your chest hurts?'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The words were terrifying to Clayborne, who had a long history of cardiac issues. She gave birth to Micah in 2010. He was born premature, at 34 weeks, and during the delivery, Clayborne had a heart attack. She spent weeks in the cardiac intensive care unit and was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy, a rare form of heart failure that happens at the end of pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. During Micah's childhood, her heart continued to weaken. She had a pacemaker and defibrillator implanted to maintain her heart rhythm, and a mechanical LVAD pump to help her heart circulate blood. In 2018, she had a heart transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of Clayborne's history, Micah had seen a cardiologist regularly as a child. There were never any issues. But Clayborne knew the chest pains could be a warning sign, and she brought him to a cardiologist at 10:30 a.m. the next day. By 11:15 a.m., Micah had been admitted to the cardiac ICU at Children's Medical Center Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests found Micah's heart was functioning at just 7% and that he was "very close to sudden cardiac death," Clayborne said. Just like his mom had, Micah needed a pacemaker and defibrillator. He would eventually need a transplant, too.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When they tell you that you are going to die, you're like, 'OK, I can fight this,' but when they tell you your child is going to die, that's a whole different set of emotions. Not only are you helpless, you are hopeless," Clayborne said. "And as a person who went through it, knowing what his future looks like, knowing the surgeries that are coming up and what the recovery from those is like, is incredibly difficult to try to explain to your child. It was devastating." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An incredibly rare diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors tested Micah to figure out why a previously healthy teen would be having such severe heart problems. They found that he had Danon disease, a rare genetic condition that affects only about 300 families worldwide. Further testing found that Clayborne also had the condition. The Claybornes are the only documented African-American patients with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the LAMP2 gene cause Danon disease, said Dr. Rakesh Singh, the medical director of the pediatric heart failure and transplantation program at NYU Langone's Hassenfeld Children's Hospital. The gene creates a protein that gets rid of excess waste in the body's cells. The mutation interrupts that process. The inability to get rid of cellular waste causes the heart muscle to thicken, causing the organ to work less efficiently and creating a form of heart failure that "doesn't respond well to medications," Singh said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not uncommon for these children to require heart transplantations in their 20s," Singh explained. Danon disease patients may also have neurological issues or eye problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A long-awaited transplant &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Micah had the pacemaker and defibrillator implanted, he was put on the national waiting list for a heart transplant. In October 2024, Clayborne received the call they had been waiting for. Micah was playing video games when she gave him the news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was like 'Yes, this is it, I get a second chance,'" Micah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family headed back to the Children's Medical Center Dallas. As Micah underwent surgery, Clayborne waited nervously. She only became more panicked when she received an update from the transplant team: Micah's heart had been removed, but the new donor heart was still several minutes away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am in my brain freaking out. I got out of the waiting room, and I was like, 'I just have to go take a walk.' I wasn't going anywhere specific," Clayborne recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She stepped onto the nearest elevator, then held the doors for a man. She saw he was wheeling a container holding a donor heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I looked down and I said 'I think that's my son's heart,'" Clayborne said. "He just kind of smiled at me. Then the doors opened, and he went, fast as he could, straight into the OR. It was this incredibly surreal moment." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Building a unique support system  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the delivery hiccup, Micah's heart transplant went smoothly. About nine months after the surgery, Micah, now 14, is doing well. He's back in school and receiving regular follow-up care — and focusing on a new passion project.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Micah was awaiting transplant, he had realized how few resources there were for teenagers in his circumstances. There were support groups for parents. There were playgroups for younger kids. Clayborne even asked hospital staff if there were virtual meetings he could join. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt really bad going back in and saying 'Micah, there is no support for you,'" Clayborne said. "And his response was 'I guess we gotta make one.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, Micah and Clayborne launched Transplant Teenz, a virtual community aimed at connecting teenagers nationwide while they wait for organ transplants. The non-profit group hosts group meetings and online events and shares educational materials. Dozens have already joined. Micah said he hopes to have 100 participants by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being a teenager is when you're starting to become an adult, and things become more stressful," Micah said. "Transplant just makes everything more stressful without a support group around you. My hope is to give teens a group they can go to that I had never had." &lt;/p&gt;

Overall rates have been stable, though certain types of abnormalities are on the rise nationwide, including congenital heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common birth defects among Alaskan babies, according to the 2021 report, were cardiovascular (33 percent) and musculoskeletal (24 percent). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One musculoskeletal defect that has emerged in Alaska is clubfoot, an abnormality that causes a baby's feet to turn inward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the National Birth Defects Prevention Network (NBDPN), between 2016 and 2020, the rate of clubfoot was reported to be between 2.8 and 3.1 babies per 1,000 live births.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alaska is the northernmost state in the US, and along with being battered by brutal weather conditions and plunged into almost two months of darkness, it is seeing a rising number of birth defects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is the highest rate in the US, where the average is about one in 1,000 births. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to March of Dimes, clubfoot prevalence was highest among Alaskans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent, at an average of 4.6 incidences per 1,000 live births between 2014 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American Indian and Alaskan Native rates were 3.6 per 1,000 births.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clubfoot, also called talipes equinovarus, occurs when a baby's foot turns inward so much that the bottom of the foot faces sideways or up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It happens because the tendons that connect the muscles to bones in the baby's leg and foot are shorter than they should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half of babies who have clubfoot have it in both feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although clubfoot is not painful for an infant, treatment is necessary to allow for normal walking and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If left untreated, a baby will have trouble walking, be susceptible to infections on their feet, have thickened skin on the foot and develop arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment includes physical therapy and in some cases surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But access to rehabilitation in remote communities like those in Alaska can be significantly limited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rural Health Information Hub estimates one-third of the state's population - about 240,000 people - live in rural areas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact reasons for this increased prevalence of the particular condition are not fully understood, experts believe that there are several factors at play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The prevalence of birth defects among native children is about 2.5 times higher&lt;span&gt; than among white children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Living near hazardous waste sites or having exposure to other environmental toxins can increase the risk of birth defects (remote Alaskan village of Utqiagvik pictured above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A musculoskeletal defect that has emerged in Alaska is clubfoot &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other common birth defects in the state include heart defects, cleft lip and palate, and spina bifida. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some research suggests certain gene variations may be more common in Alaskan Native populations, potentially increasing the risk for specific birth defects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These variations don't guarantee the development of a condition, but they do increase susceptibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Previous studies have also shown maternal smoking can increase birth defect risks, and surveys have revealed a high percentage of women of child-bearing age smoke in Alaska.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living near hazardous waste sites or having exposure to other environmental toxins can also increase risk levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Disposing of hazardous waste in rural areas is often difficult due to remoteness, harsh weather and inadequate infrastructure. As a result, it is sometimes disposed of in ways that allow dangerous chemicals to seep out and into surrounding soil, negatively impacting ecosystems and human health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, air pollution and contamination of ground water from manufacturing plants or local businesses can also expose pregnant residents to toxins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to genetics and toxic waste, alcoholism can play a role the problem that has seemingly plagued these remote parts of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The high number of alcohol-related birth defects in remote and rural Alaskan communities have led to the implementation of various measures, including alcohol bans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common alcohol-related birth defects involve the nervous system, heart and skeletal system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can include conditions like microcephaly - a small head - heart defects and skeletal abnormalities such as radioulnar synostosis, the abnormal connection of the forearm bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Facial abnormalities like cleft lip and palate, and sensory issues such as vision and hearing problems are also frequently observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This means moderating foods that are full of saturated fats, sugar and salt, Wang said. (Additionally, Kim pointed out that there is a relationship between salt intake and high blood pressure, which, as we now know, is another stroke risk factor.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what you &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;eat, Kim points to the work of author and journalist &lt;a href="https://michaelpollan.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Michael Pollan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68701459e4b0ec4e1b973ccb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://michaelpollan.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Michael Pollan&lt;/a&gt;. This advice is “eat food, mostly plants, not too much,” Wang said. This means having a diet that’s rich in fruits and veggies with some meat added in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dismiss Necessary Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since strokes are so common in this country (and this world), it’s important that you’re aware of the signs and get treated as soon as possible. Available stroke treatments work better the sooner they’re done, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because many strokes aren’t painful, and the symptoms of stroke vary so much, it’s important to recognize symptoms of stroke,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, there’s a useful acronym to help people remember the signs — and that &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/fast-materials" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="acronym is FAST" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68701459e4b0ec4e1b973ccb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/fast-materials" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;acronym is FAST&lt;/a&gt;, Kim said.

Although the differences between liberal and conservative students were small, they were consistent and measurable. However, a follow-up study revealed a striking mismatch between reality and perception: students on campus believed the behavioral divide between liberals and conservatives was far larger than it actually was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research aimed to understand whether political differences extend beyond opinions and values to include behavior in everyday, nonpolitical activities. While political polarization is often described in terms of opposing beliefs, the study examined whether liberals and conservatives also live different kinds of lives—and whether others perceive those differences accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m really interested in everyday life,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.sanaztalaifar.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sanaz Talaifar&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at Imperial College London. “Kenneth Craik has a great quote about the importance of studying the seemingly mundane. He says, ‘Lives are lived day by day, one day at a time, from day to day, day after day, day in day out … lives as we experience and observe them are inherently quotidian.’ I was interested in whether even the mundane, ostensibly non-political stuff of everyday life is politically polarized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I also think that we, as researchers, live in really exciting times. The technological advancements that have transformed people’s lives have also transformed how we do research. People always have their smartphones with them, and we can use that fact to collect data about what they’re doing in everyday life with an unprecedented scope and granularity (with their consent, of course). I was really excited about using data collected from smartphones to study the everyday behavior of liberals and conservatives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted two related studies at the University of Texas at Austin. In the first study, they recruited over 1,200 undergraduates to track their daily behaviors over two weeks using a smartphone app. The app collected data from sensors (such as GPS and microphone) and activity logs (including calls and texts) alongside short daily surveys. Students also completed a one-time questionnaire reporting their political orientation and basic demographics. This combination of passive tracking and self-reports allowed the researchers to capture 61 different behaviors in four domains: social activity, physical movement, academic or work-related activity, and leisure time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political orientation was measured on a 7-point scale from “extremely liberal” to “extremely conservative.” The students’ behaviors were then statistically correlated with their political self-placement, with controls in place to account for other possible influences such as gender, ethnicity, personality traits, socioeconomic status, and whether students lived on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite attending the same university and living under similar daily constraints, liberal and conservative students showed subtle but consistent differences in their patterns of behavior. The differences were strongest in the leisure domain. Conservative students, for instance, were more likely to spend time in noisy social environments, attend religious spaces, and be present at fraternities or sororities. They also showed slightly higher rates of physical activity, including walking and commuting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberal students, on the other hand, tended to spend more time in transit and visited more varied locations, suggesting a more mobile lifestyle. They also spent more time at home and reported higher use of the internet and social media. In the work domain, conservatives were more likely to be studying or attending meetings, while liberals were more likely to report working and spending time with coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some of these differences also showed up at specific times of day or week—for example, liberals were more active in the mornings, while conservatives were more likely to rest during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew from prior research that liberals and conservatives have different cultural and consumer preferences,” Talaifar told PsyPost. “We’ve all heard the stereotypes about liberals drinking lattes and conservatives driving trucks. Maybe some of those differences seem obvious. But I don’t think I appreciated the extent to which everyday behaviors that seemingly have nothing to do with politics or cultural stereotypes could also be polarized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, I don’t think we would necessarily expect those differences when we’re looking at conservatives and liberals who otherwise have so much in common otherwise — they’re all on the same campus, in the same city, roughly the same age, pursuing the same education, and living the same kind of student lifestyle. Even under those conditions, you see that liberals and conservatives behave differently in everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These behavioral patterns were small in magnitude but statistically robust. On average, the differences were about the same size as those found between men and women or between different socioeconomic groups in the sample. Most of the associations remained significant even when controlling for potential confounds such as personality traits or religiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something we don’t talk about much in the paper is that behavioral differences in everyday life weren’t limited to liberals and conservatives,” Talaifar said. “We found behavioral differences between women and men, upper and lower class students, as well as students of color and white students. So lately I’ve been thinking about how everyday life is bifurcated along all kinds of identity lines, not just political identity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study looked at how students perceived these behavioral differences. A new group of 156 undergraduates was asked to estimate how often liberal or conservative students on their campus engaged in the same 61 behaviors. Their task was to indicate whether they believed liberals or conservatives were more likely to engage in each behavior, or whether there was no difference. The researchers then compared these perceptions to the actual behavioral data from Study 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of Study 2 showed a strong disconnect between perception and reality. Most students significantly overestimated how much liberal and conservative students differed in their daily behaviors. When asked to guess which group did a particular activity more, students were incorrect about three out of every four behaviors. Most of the inaccuracies involved imagining partisan differences that did not exist. For example, students frequently assumed conservatives were more likely to commute, even though the data showed no such difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that students were most accurate when judging leisure behaviors—the domain where real differences were most pronounced. But they were far less accurate in estimating partisan differences in social and work-related behaviors. This suggests that people may be more attuned to visible lifestyle cues, while underestimating—or misunderstanding—less observable daily patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these studies highlight a double layer of polarization: one that exists in behavior, and one that exists in perception. While political identity does shape some aspects of lifestyle, the belief that liberals and conservatives live in completely different worlds is an exaggeration. That misperception may itself contribute to political division. If people assume that those on the other side of the political spectrum live fundamentally different lives, they may be less inclined to interact, cooperate, or empathize with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Liberals and conservatives behave differently in everyday life, but not to the extent that people assume,” Talaifar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that lifestyle polarization, even when subtle, can reduce the chances of cross-partisan contact. People who live different kinds of lives—working at different times, visiting different places, socializing in different settings—may have fewer chances to encounter one another. But even more damaging may be the belief that these differences are vast and unbridgeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The behavioral differences were robust and mostly held when we accounted for demographic factors like socioeconomic status, gender, and ethnicity,” Talaifar noted. “But it’s important to remember that the behavioral differences were small overall. There were many behaviors liberals and conservatives engaged in to a similar degree, and other students on campus generally overestimated the degree to which liberals and conservatives behaved differently in everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now building on their findings by exploring how lifestyle polarization may relate to other important outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right now we’re looking at whether the behavioral differences we found can explain wellbeing differences between liberals and conservatives,” Talaifar explained. “Prior research generally finds that liberals are unhappier than conservatives, so we’re investigating whether their everyday behaviors can explain that. I’m also &lt;a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/6mk2a_v1" target="_blank"&gt;working on a project&lt;/a&gt; that maps the everyday behavioral patterns of individuals with authoritarian tendencies using data collected with smartphones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2026-13129-001.html" target="_blank"&gt;Lifestyle Polarization on a College Campus: Do Liberals and Conservatives Behave Differently in Everyday Life?&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sanaz Talaifar email the author, Diana Jordan, Samuel D.

"This is why we continue to monitor the safety of medicines on the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the few years since GLP-1s have &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/blogs/bioethics/on-the-increase-in-use-of-glp-1s" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;flooded the market&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/mcdonalds-ozempic" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;changed American food consumption&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/diet-industry-ozempic-meltdown" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;utterly upended the weight loss industry&lt;/a&gt;, a handful of studies have looked into some of their scarier side effects — and their results aren't exactly inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last summer, Harvard researchers &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/semaglutide-ozempic-linked-condition-blindness" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;revealed a troubling link&lt;/a&gt; between semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a condition that blocks blood flow to the eyes and can cause blindness. In that study, people with diabetes who take semaglutide were found to be four times more likely to develop NAION than the average person — and although there are &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/experts-criticize-ozempic-blindness-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;some complicating factors&lt;/a&gt;, that's nothing to scoff at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1070623" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;doctors at Washington University in St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; found that people who take GLP-1s have increased rates of kidney problems and pancreatitis — a disorder that the United Kingdom's medical regulator has, separately, &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/ozempic-glp-1-illnesses-deaths" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;begun investigating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/semaglutide-arthritis-study-success" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;tons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/ozempic-alcohol-drug-addiction" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/glp-1-ozempic-benefits-map" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;constellation of health benefits&lt;/a&gt; these drugs can have &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/semaglutide-opioid-overdose" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;outside of weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, there hasn't been as much research into their of adverse effects&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and what's already out there might not represent the full population of people who take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though women make up an estimated 65 percent of GLP-1 users in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.realchemistry.com/article/states-with-highest-rates-of-glp-1-use" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;per the healthcare market analysis group Real Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, there have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8950819/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;only been&lt;/a&gt; a few studies that &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/166/2/bqae165/7931638" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;take into account&lt;/a&gt; how &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39819958/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;different genders respond&lt;/a&gt; to the drugs.

"Women show unique side-effects to many pharmacotherapies, and still [in] most studies women are often underrepresented at various stages of testing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the Canadian neuroendocrinologist still believes that the "list of benefits for this drug, if taken as prescribed, is still significantly longer and more impactful than risks," doctors and patients alike need to be able to make that cost-benefit analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And without sufficient study into risks, that analysis is skewed in the favor of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/21/ozempic-wegovy-diabetes-weight-spending/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;high-grossing drug manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; — which is bad news for the people who may bear the brunt of these potentially serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on Ozempic: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/ozempic-inventor-generic-fee" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something Comically Bad Just Happened to the Inventor of Ozempic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 10:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFA4VVR1SXhzeDZLU3dINjdhSWdrZ25fMk9UMUtiVHVsRkZDWVB2cUEzTE95RnozUURCa3IzeGliTE0yRFpUSHZhaUhJR1Q1Q2lEZENSY1pDX3ZxQ3RvZWtlZVpRQmVJLUwtVVE</guid></item><item><title>10种可能在您不知情的情况下导致肾损伤的日常习惯-印度时报 | 10 Everyday habits that could lead to kidney damage without you knowing - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your kidneys are essential for filtering waste, balancing body fluids, and managing blood pressure—yet they’re often overlooked in daily health routines. Surprisingly, many common lifestyle habits may be silently damaging these vital organs over time. From overusing painkillers to eating too much salt or processed food, even seemingly harmless choices can strain your kidneys. Add in poor hydration, lack of sleep, or excessive protein, and the risks multiply. Fortunately, small, conscious changes can make a big difference. According to the National Kidney Foundation, here are &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;10 everyday habits that may contribute to kidney damage &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;and offer practical &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;tips to protect and support long-term kidney health &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;before problems become irreversible or harder to manage later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kidney damage can start with these daily habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overusing painkillers&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin are widely used to ease aches, inflammation, or fever. But frequent or high-dose use—especially without medical guidance—can reduce blood flow to the kidneys and potentially lead to long-term damage. This risk is even higher for people already living with kidney disease. To protect your kidneys, use NSAIDs sparingly and never exceed the recommended dosage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;'Awareness is the Key to Healthy Kidneys': Expert's Vital Message on World Kidney Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eating too much salt&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess sodium is a known contributor to high blood pressure, one of the leading causes of kidney damage. Most of this salt doesn’t come from the salt shaker but from processed and packaged foods. Over time, high sodium levels can strain kidney function. Try seasoning meals with herbs, lemon juice, or garlic to reduce your salt intake without sacrificing flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you prioritize drinking enough water daily?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Consuming too many processed foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study revealed that diets heavy in ultra-processed foods can increase the risk of chronic kidney disease by 24%. These foods are high in sodium, unhealthy fats, added sugars, and chemical additives—yet low in fiber and essential nutrients. Swap them out for whole foods like fresh vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains to support kidney and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Not drinking enough water&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water helps your kidneys remove toxins through urine. Dehydration, especially during intense activity or hot weather, can lead to kidney stones or impair how well your kidneys filter waste. While those with late-stage kidney disease may need to limit fluid intake, most people should aim for 6 to 8 glasses of water a day. Always consult your doctor to determine what’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skimping on sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your kidneys, like the rest of your body, follow a daily rhythm. Sleep regulates hormones that affect kidney function and fluid balance. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to higher risks of high blood pressure and kidney problems. Prioritize 7–8 hours of quality sleep each night to give your kidneys time to recover and regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eating too much protein&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is essential for health, but excessive consumption—especially from red meat—can put extra stress on your kidneys. Animal proteins produce waste products that kidneys must filter out. In people with pre-existing kidney conditions, this burden can accelerate damage. Opt for lean proteins like fish or plant-based alternatives, and talk to your healthcare provider about how much protein is appropriate for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overindulging in sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming too much sugar can lead to weight gain, obesity, and eventually diabetes—all of which increase your risk of kidney disease. Added sugars are found not just in sweets but in seemingly healthy foods like flavored yogurt, breakfast cereals, and sauces. Reading nutrition labels and cutting back on sugary drinks and snacks can help safeguard your kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Smoking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking doesn’t just harm your lungs and heart—it also affects your kidneys. Nicotine can impair blood flow and damage kidney tissue. Additionally, smokers are more likely to have protein in their urine, a marker of kidney damage. Quitting smoking can significantly reduce your risk and improve your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Drinking too much alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy alcohol consumption disrupts how kidneys regulate fluid and electrolytes in your body. It can also dehydrate you, increase blood pressure, and worsen liver health—making your kidneys work harder. Moderate drinking is generally considered one drink per day for women and two for men. Anything beyond that may raise your risk of kidney and liver complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Living a sedentary lifestyle&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of physical activity is linked to weight gain, poor circulation, and higher blood pressure—all of which can negatively impact kidney health. Regular exercise helps manage weight and cholesterol and improves heart and kidney function. Even light activities like walking, stretching, or yoga can benefit your kidneys when done consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key lifestyle habits that can prevent kidney damage naturally&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay well-hydrated: &lt;/strong&gt;Drinking enough water helps your kidneys flush out waste and prevent kidney stones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more whole foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and home-cooked meals instead of processed or salty foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit salt and sugar intake: &lt;/strong&gt;Reducing sodium and added sugars can help control blood pressure and lower your risk of diabetes—both major causes of kidney disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful of medications: &lt;/strong&gt;Avoid overusing NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) and always follow dosage instructions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritise quality sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;Your kidneys rely on a regular sleep-wake cycle to function efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay physically active: &lt;/strong&gt;Regular exercise helps regulate blood pressure, manage weight, and improve overall kidney function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor protein consumption: &lt;/strong&gt;While protein is important, too much—especially from animal sources—can burden your kidneys, especially if you already have kidney concerns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid smoking and limit alcohol: &lt;/strong&gt;Smoking reduces blood flow to your kidneys; excessive alcohol can dehydrate and strain them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get regular checkups: &lt;/strong&gt;Especially if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a family history of kidney issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-superfood-could-be-the-cheapest-way-to-eat-healthier-and-its-already-in-your-kitchen/articleshow/122363684.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;This superfood could be the cheapest way to eat healthier and it’s already in your kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 07:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>私人教练说，如果你经常走路，你应该经常做这三个练习- Fit&amp;Well | A personal trainer says these are the three exercises you should be doing regularly if you walk a lot - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3gFBVV95cUxPcTU1TVp5Q3M5VGg0bWxLelNqS2ZkZlRWd2FnWnJKMDNMeWl4NXZiUzUwTjdPcy1aa3E4X1BMejRyUE1WbGxyMzExWkV6SDZPTmQzclVWTE1YOHM4NVpOckhTVVpJUnRUODl2eHlNMWRzRy1ISU1zWXBHMi1TbldHdl9tVWFHcXB1YnFMZDNtbWxOWkFWYUhxV0dvLXRjeU12cjlTUXExblI4QW9taEZibGNxNEJPaDNBVmdKdmU1RXBvUGxKd3JZeUxLWjlNaEI4TG9aZ2VubV9qUnVHUEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking might seem like a simple way to work out but it’s one of the best things you can do for your body. If you’re new to walking it’s worth being aware of the muscles it engages and how you can keep them strong, supple and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking is one of the most underrated forms of movement,” says Alo Moves' head trainer for Los Angeles, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1626907&amp;amp;xcust=fitandwell_gb_7594978304975648596&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alomoves.com%2Finstructors%2Flouis-chandler&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitandwell.com%2Fexercise%2Fwalking%2Fa-personal-trainer-says-these-are-the-three-exercises-you-should-be-doing-regularly-if-you-walk-a-lot" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.alomoves.com/instructors/louis-chandler" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1626907&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alomoves.com%2Finstructors%2Flouis-chandler&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitandwell.com%2Fexercise%2Fwalking%2Fa-personal-trainer-says-these-are-the-three-exercises-you-should-be-doing-regularly-if-you-walk-a-lot" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="alomoves.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;Louis Chandler&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s low-impact, accessible and incredibly effective for maintaining overall mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also enhances body awareness by reinforcing good posture, stride mechanics and mindful movement, which are all essential for joint health and injury prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can be surprisingly effective at helping you build strength, tone and endurance in your muscles, despite being low-impact. And because many people can sustain walking longer than running, it can also mean burning more calories over time, especially if you’re just starting with fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over time, walking builds endurance and resiliency that support healthy aging both inside and outside the gym,” says Chandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a balance perspective, walking requires coordination and weight shifting from one side of the body to the other, which strengthens stabilizing muscles and helps prevent falls as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Chandler what we should all be doing to support our walking muscles, and he gave me his top three exercises to stretch and strengthen the lower body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pN6Lq5EMUY7gRFYJJKQTxQ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pN6Lq5EMUY7gRFYJJKQTxQ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll need a pair of dumbbells or kettlebells, but you can also use filled water bottles or a backpack in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-calf-stretch"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

Stretching the calves regularly also supports ankle mobility, which is key for stability during walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-romanian-deadlift"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Romanian deadlift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Alo Moves)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets&lt;/strong&gt;: 2-3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps&lt;/strong&gt;: 8-10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet hip-width apart with a slight bend in your knees holding dumbbells, or a kettlebell or barbell in front of your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your back flat and core engaged, hinge at the hips, pushing your hips back, to lower the weight, keeping it close to your legs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, then push your hips forward to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep the movement slow and controlled throughout, and avoid rounding your back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works: &lt;/strong&gt;“Romanian deadlifts [RDLs] are excellent for strengthening the hamstrings and glutes, which are the primary muscles that drive powerful, efficient steps,” says Chandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strengthening these muscles improves your walking speed and stamina, while helping to reduce fatigue during longer distances. Additionally, RDLs reinforce the hip hinge movement pattern, which is essential for protecting your lower back and promoting healthy posture as you move.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-weighted-march"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Weighted march&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Alo Moves)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;2-3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps: &lt;/strong&gt;10-12 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand holding weights by your sides and engage your core.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lift one knee to hip height while keeping your spine upright and shoulders back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your foot and repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continue alternating legs, marching in place with control and balance, engaging your hips and core.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works: &lt;/strong&gt;“Kettlebell marches are a dynamic exercise that improves core stability, balance and coordination,” says Chandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these elements are crucial for maintaining a strong, efficient walking gait. Because this movement mimics the natural gait cycle while adding resistance, you’re training your body to walk better under load. This helps build endurance and control, reducing fatigue and improving overall walking performance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your knees tend to cave in during squats or split squats, there could be an often-overlooked culprit: a weak gluteus medius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Gluteus_Medius" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Gluteus_Medius" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;gluteus medius&lt;/a&gt; is one of three big muscles in your buttocks, sitting at the side of your hip. It helps to stabilize your pelvis, hips and legs, especially during weight-bearing movements like squats, lunges and even walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it’s weak, your body compensates and may result in poor movement patterns that can cause your knees to cave in. Physical therapist and&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://squatuniversity.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://squatuniversity.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; Squat University&lt;/a&gt; founder Dr. Aaron Horschig highlighted this in a recent post on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the side of your hip lies a small muscle called your glute medius that helps stabilize your pelvis and leg. If it’s not working well your knees can cave, your pelvis can drop and the rest of your body can feel the effects,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horschig recommends doing a clamshell in a side plank position to both strengthen and activate this muscle. This variation, he explains, helps the gluteus medius stay contracted throughout the move, improving pelvic and hip stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking about other ways to build strength in this area so I spoke to clinical exercise physiologist and orthopedic surgeon &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.myobesityteam.com/writers/6835c45e8e89dba722d93ad5" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.myobesityteam.com/writers/6835c45e8e89dba722d93ad5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Jerome Enad&lt;/a&gt;. He explained more about the importance of the gluteus medius and recommended three exercises to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-does-a-strong-gluteus-medius-improve-squat-technique"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How does a strong gluteus medius improve squat technique?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gluteus medius helps maintain proper alignment of the pelvis, but weak or injured hips can cause issues with balance and coordination,” says Enad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Jjm7ekZzK9Tb2P5PR9jNUX" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Jjm7ekZzK9Tb2P5PR9jNUX slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A condition known as the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Trendelenburg_Gait" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Trendelenburg_Gait" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Trendlenburg gait&lt;/a&gt; can develop. This is when the weak gluteus medius can’t hold the pelvis level when standing on the weaker side, so it drops on the opposite side during walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like when you carry a heavy backpack on just one shoulder, causing you to be lopsided. Similarly, if a person with a weak gluteus medius is doing squats, the compensation that occurs while standing on both feet is a type of lean that may look like your knee is caving in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends trying these three moves to strengthen the gluteus medius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-single-leg-deadlift"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Single-leg deadlift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 10 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;From standing, shift your weight onto your right foot, bending your right knee slightly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lean forward, hinging at your hips while lifting your left leg behind you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push your hips forward to slowly return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do all your reps on one side, then switch sides.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it harder:&lt;/strong&gt; hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in one hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-clamshell"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Clamshell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie on your side with your knees bent at 90° and one knee on top of the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raise the top knee while keeping your feet together. Avoid moving your pelvis or tilting backward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower the knee back down with control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it harder: Place a short-loop resistance band around the knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-banded-lateral-walk"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

Both areas tested positive for the West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, no county residents have reported being infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cache Mosquito Abatement District has been informed of the virus' presence in the county, and the district said it will continue its abatement efforts, especially in the evenings when the mosquitos known to carry the virus are the most present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abatement district recommends Cache County residents do the following to limit the risk of acquiring West Nile virus: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellent containing DEET, permethrin, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus as directed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate standing water around your home&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear long sleeves and pants between dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain roof gutters, keeping them clear of debris.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean or drain swimming pools regularly. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure all window and door screens are intact and in good repair.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trim tall grass and weeds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is the most common disease carried by mosquitoes in the United States and can affect humans along with birds and horses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other animals can also be affected, they have reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is transferred from a mosquito through a bite to a receiver. Most people who get the virus have mild symptoms similar to those with the flu, the CDC reports. Health officials also report that many people also have no symptoms at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, one human case with the West Nile virus was found in Utah County, according to the county health department. The virus was found in Draper in 2024 but in mosquitoes only, according to Draper city government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

It’s possible these wastewater results simply reflect that person. Information from wastewater will be most useful when it is positive in areas where no one has been identified with measles. When that happens, we will be able to use the data to alert clinicians in those areas to make sure they are aware someone with measles may come in for care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Previously, 7 measles cases were confirmed in Utah; all unvaccinated patients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;
    
        &lt;p class="VideoEnhancement-title"&gt;All 3 confirmed measles cases in Utah were unvaccinated&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
        
    
    
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials were notified by WastewaterSCAN officials monitoring wastewater for infectious diseases, including measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person who has measles can spread the illness to others even before they have a rash. The risk of getting measles from wastewater is extremely low. Measles virus spreads through the air and close contact with an infected person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of measles cases in Utah is updated every day by 3 p.m. &lt;a class="Link" href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They suspect these improperly shaped proteins could &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14873675/creatine-Alzheimers-disease-improve-memory.html"&gt;interfere with how the brain works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Amyloids are big and ugly and easy to spot under a microscope, so they've gotten most of the attention,' lead researcher Dr Stephen Fried said. 'But our research shows they're just the tip of the iceberg.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and primarily affects people over the age of 65. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Until now, researchers believed that clumps of amyloid and tau proteins were the main culprits behind the devastating cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer's patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 7.2 million adults among that age bracket in the US are currently living with the condition, and over 100,000 die from it each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study was conducted on rats, Dr Keith Vossel, a professor of Neurology at UCLA, says more research is needed to understand whether the same misfolded proteins can cause Alzheimer's disease in humans.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's an incremental advance, but it definitely builds on our knowledge base about this disease,' he told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determining whether this change also happens in human brains, Dr Vossel said, 'would require autopsy based studies' or examining resected hippocampal tissue - 'that's really the only way to assess it directly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the moment it's a nice association,' he added, 'it just requires a lot more follow-up.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On examination, they found that over 200 proteins were misfolded in the cognitively impaired rats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that the findings could open the door to entirely new treatments and targets for Alzheimer's, which currently has no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association warns that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans may be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The disease is believed to be caused by the development of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, which damage and kill cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles form when amyloid proteins misfold and stick together, forming sticky clumps (plaques) and when tau proteins twist and get tied up (tangles). These toxic buildups block brain cells, or neurons, from sending signals properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to being in the wrong form, misfolded proteins are unable to carry out tasks necessary for a cell to function properly, which leads to damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A group of Johns Hopkins University researchers have found over 200 other misfolded proteins in rats that may also contribute to the cognitive decline caused by the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this can impair brain functioning and lead to memory and muscle decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it persists, this disruption can cause permanent damage in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the disease progresses, patients may lose the ability to speak, care for themselves or even respond to the world around them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To better understand what drives this damage at the molecular level, Dr Stephen Fried and his team studied 17 rats, all 2 years old and raised in the same conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They put the animals through a series of memory and problem-solving tasks, and found that seven showed clear signs of cognitive impairment, despite growing up in the same environment as the other 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This allowed the researchers to focus on what might be happening inside their brains, and helped lead to the discovery of more than 200 potentially damaging proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remaining 10 rats performed the same as 6-month-old rats did when they were given the same tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on their performance, the scientists then measured over 2,500 types of protein in all the rats' hippocampi - the part of the brain associated with spatial learning and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that over 200 proteins were misfolded in the cognitively impaired rats. Though, it remains unclear which proteins, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the same proteins maintained their shapes in the cognitively healthy rats who scored as well as their 6-month-old counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, the researchers concluded that more than 200 misfolded proteins are contributing to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We think there are a lot of proteins that can be misfolded, not form amyloids, and still be problematic,' Fried said of the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Fried and his team plan to study these phenomena under high-resolution microscopes to get a more detailed picture of their deformities at the molecular level. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A lot of us have experienced a loved one or a relative who has become less capable of doing those everyday tasks that require cognitive abilities,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Understanding what's physically going on in the brain could lead to better treatments and preventive measures.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published on July 11 in the Science Advances journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists may be one step closer to understanding why polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) tends to run in families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, presented July 1 at the 41st Annual Meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Paris, suggests that "disruptions" in the way genes are turned on and off may increase the likelihood of developing PCOS. These "epigenetic" changes alter gene activity without changing DNA's underlying code, but they may also be passed down through families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, this research hints at a potential avenue for preventing PCOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person was undergoing &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22457-ivf" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22457-ivf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in vitro fertilization (IVF)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, "these damaging [epigenetic] markers may be identified in embryos and changed before being implanted in a pregnant person, preventing PCOS from being passed onto future offspring," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sjpp.org/find-a-doctor/sheryl-ross-md/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sjpp.org/find-a-doctor/sheryl-ross-md/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Sherry Ross&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified OB/GYN at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, "further research needs to be done in human embryos to understand if this is a safe and viable intervention," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="understanding-pcos-inheritance-3"&gt;Understanding PCOS inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34805-pcos-symptoms-treatment-insulin-resistance.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34805-pcos-symptoms-treatment-insulin-resistance.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PCOS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a hormonal condition that affects 6% to 13% of reproductive-age women, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/polycystic-ovary-syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/polycystic-ovary-syndrome" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (WHO).

They found this concordance was twice as high among identical twins than fraternal twins, "suggesting that a large portion of the risk of developing PCOS is due to inherited genes," Chang told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's estimated &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/#inheritance" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/#inheritance" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;that 20% to 40% of people with PCOS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have a mother or sister with the condition. But the exact pattern of inheritance is unclear, Chang noted. On that front, the new research may shed some light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qianshu-Zhu" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qianshu-Zhu" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Qianshu Zhu&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of reproductive biology at the Institute of Reproductive Medicine at Chongqing Medical University in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, included about 230 women undergoing IVF, 133 of whom had PCOS and 95 of whom didn't. The researchers looked at unfertilized egg cells and pre-implantation embryos from these participations, looking for chemical tags, known as epigenetic markers, on the cells' DNA. These markers affect the activity of the genes they're attached to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the eggs and embryos of people without PCOS, those from participants with the condition showed "widespread disruptions" in many key genes, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1088643" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1088643" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to a statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Affected genes were involved in metabolic processes and activation of the early embryo's DNA. Sections of the genome called retrotransposons, which must be tightly regulated to keep DNA stable, were also affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also noted irregular patterns in well-known epigenetic markers that help control genes, including one called H3K27me3. In the statement, Zhu noted that "about half of the abnormal H3K27me3 signatures we saw in Day 3 embryos were already present in the oocyte [egg cells]. This tells us that an epigenetic signal is being passed from mother to embryo before implantation even begins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these mechanisms could enable new preventative interventions for PCOS. The authors suggested that embryos created through IVF could potentially be treated to tweak their epigenetics and thus lower the risk of PCOS being inherited. The findings could also be useful in aiding embryo selection processes in IVF, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhu emphasized, however, that the research is based on only lab-made embryos and cannot demonstrate how these epigenetic markers affect children. His team is now pursuing mouse studies to better understand the potential effects in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is exciting about this new research is it supports an actual genetic association between PCOS in families," Ross said, "and shines light for early diagnosis and interventions to prevent PCOS from being transmitted through families."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-sNa82pXzU48VEJHEt529dQ-TrEeATPmiE2DNAkDi8UOqOhimPo56Aap" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-sNa82pXzU48VEJHEt529dQ-TrEeATPmiE2DNAkDi8UOqOhimPo56Aap slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A 51-year-old man showed up at a hospital in Germany looking as though he was wasting away, with swelling and tenderness in his ankles and knees. Then, his heart stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors were able to resuscitate him. Then, they got to work trying to figure out what was wrong. The man told them that for three months he had been suffering from diarrhea, weight loss, joint pain, and fever. His case was reported in this week's issue of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2413719?logout=true"&gt;the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood tests didn't detect any infection, but imaging of his heart told a different story. Doctors saw "vegetation" on both his aortic valve and mitral valve. Vegetations are clumps or masses that often build up from an infection, generally containing a bundle of proteins, platelets, and infecting germs stuck together. While they cause damage where they are, if they fully dislodge, they threaten to move to other parts of the body, such as the brain or lungs, and cause dangerous blockages. In the man's case, the vegetation on his aortic valve appeared mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was quickly sent to emergency surgery to replace his valves. Once removed, the diseased valves were sent for testing to see what was in those dangerous masses. The result likely came as a surprise to the doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man had in his heart &lt;em&gt;Tropheryma whipplei&lt;/em&gt;, a very common environmental bacterium that dwells in soil. Only in exceedingly rare cases does it cause an infection—but when it does it's a systemic, chronic, and sometimes life-threatening one called Whipple's disease. The condition affects about one to three people in a million, most often middle-aged Caucasian men, like the patient in this case. Overall, 85 percent of Whipple's disease cases are in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Curious condition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how can such a common germ also cause such a rare infection? Researchers think it's due to genetic predisposition and a glitch in immune responses. Many people likely get infected with &lt;em&gt;T. whipplei&lt;/em&gt; as kids, and have either an asymptomatic or limited gastrointestinal infection. They then develop protective immune responses. But in the few people who develop Whipple's disease, this process seems to go awry. Researchers hypothesize that white blood cells called macrophages—which normally engulf and destroy invading pathogens—aren't able to finish the job. They engulf &lt;em&gt;T. whipplei&lt;/em&gt;, but don't neutralize the germ. When this happens, the immune system doesn't generate protective antibodies against the bacterium, and inflammation ratchets up. This, in turn, leads to the development of a systemic infection.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Last Tuesday, I watched my 84-year-old abuela teach my nephew how to play chess—every move calculated, every strategy passed down through generations of sharp minds. Her cognition was as precise as her opening gambit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;But just down the street, my neighbor struggles to remember his grandchildren's names at 78.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The difference? The habits they've cultivated over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;While genetics play a role in cognitive aging, our daily choices matter more than our DNA when it comes to staying mentally sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The brain we have in our 80s is largely the product of the habits we practice today. Some patterns can fast-track cognitive decline, while others build resilience that lasts decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Here are seven habits that research shows can undermine your mental sharpness—and what to do instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;1. Living in social isolation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;"Loneliness kills. It's as powerful as smoking or alcoholism," says Robert Waldinger, director of the &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/#:~:text=Those%20who%20kept%20warm%20relationships,mental%20deterioration%20as%20they%20aged."&gt;Harvard Study of Adult Development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The research is clear: people who maintained strong social connections throughout their lives showed significantly less cognitive decline as they aged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Think about it like this—your brain is like a muscle that needs regular workouts. Social interaction provides complex mental exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;When you're chatting with friends, your brain juggles multiple tasks: processing speech, reading facial expressions, remembering shared experiences, and formulating responses. It's like cognitive CrossFit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The study showed that those who kept warm relationships got to live longer and happier, and the loners often died earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Even more striking: people's level of satisfaction with their relationships at age 50 was a better predictor of physical health than their cholesterol levels were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Schedule regular coffee dates, join clubs based on your interests, or volunteer for causes you care about. The key is consistent, meaningful interaction with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;2. Avoiding mental challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;When we shy away from mental effort—puzzles that stump us, books that stretch us, conversations that challenge our perspective—we deny the brain the workout it needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;As we age, this mental "coasting" can lead to earlier cognitive decline. But here's the exciting part: your brain is far more adaptable than we once believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;"New brain cell growth can happen even late into adulthood," explains &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/learning-new-skill-can-slow-cognitive-aging-201604279502"&gt;Dr. Ipsit Vahia&lt;/a&gt; from Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. "The process of learning and acquiring new information and experiences, like through structured classes, can stimulate that process."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/were-only-human/aging-photographs-and-cognitive-quilts.html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; even found that older adults who took up complex skills—like digital photography or quilting—saw improvements in memory compared to peers who only engaged in passive activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;It’s not just about staying busy; it’s about choosing challenges that stretch your capabilities and create new neural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Take up a new hobby that challenges multiple cognitive systems. Learn a language, master a musical instrument, or enroll in classes that genuinely stretch your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;3. Chronic stress without management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Stress hormones like cortisol are like acid rain on your brain. Short bursts are natural and even beneficial, but &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-stress-can-shrink-your-brain"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that chronic stress literally shrinks brain tissue, particularly in areas responsible for memory and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The Harvard study found that people who developed healthy coping mechanisms for life's ups and downs aged better cognitively. Those who learned to manage stress effectively maintained sharper minds well into their later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop a stress management toolkit. This might include meditation, regular exercise, journaling, or talking with a therapist. The key is having multiple strategies you can deploy when life gets overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;4. Neglecting quality sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Sleep is when your brain takes out the trash—literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;During deep sleep, your brain's glymphatic system washes away toxic proteins that can accumulate and contribute to cognitive decline. Skimp on sleep, and you're essentially letting garbage pile up in your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Poor sleep habits in midlife are strongly linked to cognitive problems decades later. It's like compound interest, but in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Prioritize sleep hygiene. Create a consistent bedtime routine, keep your bedroom cool and dark, and avoid screens for at least an hour before bed. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;5. Skipping regular exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Here's what surprised me about exercise and the brain: it's not just about blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Regular physical activity literally creates new brain cells, particularly in the hippocampus, the brain's memory center. It's like installing extra RAM in your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Exercise also increases the production of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254621000971"&gt;brain-derived neurotrophic factor&lt;/a&gt; (BDNF), often called "Miracle-Gro for the brain." This protein helps existing neurons survive and encourages the growth of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; You don't need to run marathons. Walking briskly for 30 minutes most days of the week can significantly boost cognitive function. Dancing, swimming, or even gardening counts. The key is consistency, not intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;6. Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The Harvard research was unambiguous: those who lived longer and enjoyed sound health avoided smoking and alcohol in excess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Both habits accelerate brain aging by increasing inflammation and reducing blood flow to brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Smoking damages blood vessels throughout your body, including those in your brain. Even moderate drinking can shrink brain tissue over time, particularly in areas responsible for decision-making and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; If you smoke, quit. If you drink, do so in moderation—no more than one drink per day for women, two for men. Seek support if you need it; quitting these habits is easier with community backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;7. Mental passivity and routine rigidity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Your brain thrives on novelty and challenge. When you stick to the same routines day after day, year after year, you're essentially putting your mind on autopilot. This mental passivity can accelerate cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The study also debunked the idea that people's personalities "set like plaster" by age 30 and cannot be changed. Your &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886"&gt;brain remains plastic&lt;/a&gt; throughout your life, but only if you give it reasons to adapt and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Shake up your routines regularly. Take a different route to work, try a new restaurant, read books outside your usual genre, or engage in activities that require you to think in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;The compound effect of healthy habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;What makes the Harvard study so remarkable is its revelation that "the role of genetics and long-lived ancestors proved less important to longevity than the level of satisfaction with relationships in midlife." Our choices compound over decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Think of brain health like tending a garden. You can't plant seeds today and expect flowers tomorrow. But tend to your mental soil consistently—feed it with challenges, water it with social connection, give it the sunlight of new experiences—and you'll harvest cognitive vitality for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The beauty of neuroplasticity is that your brain remains changeable throughout your life. It's never too late to start building better habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;Your brain's future starts today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;As I write this, I'm reminded of my abuela's hands, still steady as she moves her chess pieces, her mind still sharp as she navigates complex strategies with the wisdom of eight decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Her secret wasn't just good genes—it was a lifetime of nourishing her brain with challenging activities, strong relationships, and the daily practice of staying curious about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Your 80-year-old self is watching. What habits will you choose to cultivate today?&lt;/p&gt;

The four participants given the highest dose saw the largest benefit: a 69% reduction in LDL, at maximum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the groups, "VERVE-102 was well-tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities observed," Verve's statement noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VERVE-102 uses a modified version of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the famous gene-editing system. The CRISPR systems developed originally introduce a "break" in both strands of a DNA molecule, and then, the cell's built-in repair system swoops in to repair the break. However, this comes with the risk of adding unwanted mutations to the DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/new-crispr-alternative-can-install-whole-genes-paving-the-way-to-treatment-for-many-genetic-disorders" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/new-crispr-alternative-can-install-whole-genes-paving-the-way-to-treatment-for-many-genetic-disorders"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New CRISPR alternative can 'install' whole genes, paving the way to treatment for many genetic disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KFLePRxjU7wn7pD9ew9xcd" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KFLePRxjU7wn7pD9ew9xcd slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/crispr-therapy-for-high-cholesterol-shows-promise-in-early-trial" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/crispr-therapy-for-high-cholesterol-shows-promise-in-early-trial"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new cholesterol-lowering therapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instead uses "base editing," which swaps out just one letter in DNA's code, thus sidestepping the danger of a double-stranded break. Like classic CRISPR, the base editor still includes a "guide" molecule to fix its aim at the correct gene, and from there, an enzyme tweaks just one letter in DNA's code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VERVE-102 targets a gene called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/pcsk9/#conditions" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/pcsk9/#conditions" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PCSK9&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which controls the number of LDL receptors on the surfaces of cells. The quantity of these receptors dictates how quickly LDL gets cleared from the blood. When PCSK9 is too active — as it is in the genetic disease FH — it breaks down LDL receptors before they can make it to the cell surface, thus causing LDL to accumulate in the bloodstream instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new therapy, given in a single intravenous infusion over two to four hours, is designed to turn off PCSK9, especially in the liver, where LDL receptors are abundant. Across the three dosing groups, there was a decrease in both PCSK9 activity and LDL levels in the 28 days following the treatment, with higher doses tied to greater reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the company is enrolling a fourth group of patients who will receive an even higher dose, and who are being recruited in the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, Australia and New Zealand. As of April, two people in the group had been treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verve expects to release data from this portion of the trial later this year, as well as start its next clinical trial, which will include more participants. The next trial will likely enroll U.S. participants, as the Food and Drug Administration granted the therapy &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ir.vervetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/verve-therapeutics-receives-us-fda-fast-track-designation-verve" target="_blank" data-url="https://ir.vervetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/verve-therapeutics-receives-us-fda-fast-track-designation-verve" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;"Fast Track Designation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" to help expedite its development and approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, in June, Verve was acquired by the drug company Lilly, which aims to continue the development of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VERVE-102 has the potential to be the first&lt;em&gt; in vivo&lt;/em&gt; [in the body] gene editing therapy for broad patient populations and could shift the treatment paradigm for cardiovascular disease from chronic care to one-and-done treatment," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gatewaylabs.lilly.com/meet-our-team/ruth-gimeno" target="_blank" data-url="https://gatewaylabs.lilly.com/meet-our-team/ruth-gimeno" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ruth Gimeno&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Lilly group vice president of diabetes and metabolic research and development, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ir.vervetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-acquire-verve-therapeutics-advance-one-time-treatments" target="_blank" data-url="https://ir.vervetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-acquire-verve-therapeutics-advance-one-time-treatments" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said in a statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger and longer clinical trials will be needed before VERVE-102 can earn approval and reach more patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-KFLePRxjU7wn7pD9ew9xcd-jD1sOLhTv9GVezPn6AqbeITxlF5ktzx4" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-KFLePRxjU7wn7pD9ew9xcd-jD1sOLhTv9GVezPn6AqbeITxlF5ktzx4 slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While taking daily doses of turmeric supplements, he was hospitalized due to liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A light bulb went off in my head,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/liver-damage-turmeric-supplement-woman-hospitalized-rcna217578"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, who first revealed her story, 'and I said, 'Oh, my gosh! I wonder if this is what's wrong with me?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went to the ER, where a blood test quickly revealed that her liver enzyme levels were 60 times higher than normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said she was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14854459/Doctor-warns-five-common-supplements-cause-deadly-heart-attacks-liver-failure.html"&gt;just 'one step' from liver failure&lt;/a&gt;, which would have led to needing an organ transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Katie Mohan, 57, from New Jersey, said she nearly lost her liver after taking turmeric supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The turmeric supplements she took were pills that contained about 2,250 milligrams (mg) of curcumin, which gives turmeric its color, per pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is about 11 times the daily dose recommended by the World Health Organization for an average woman weighing about 150lbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Turmeric, a golden-colored staple in curries, is generally safe to consume, particularly in foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has exploded in popularity in recent years particularly among arthritis patients, amid claims the supplement can help reduce inflammation and soothe joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors warn that it is possible for the supplement to cause liver damage, which may be because it can trigger an immune reaction in the organ.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Mohan's case, she was hospitalized for six days and received an IV drip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But her doctors said she was fortunate that the injuries were not much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nikolaos Pyrsopoulos and a hepatologist at NYU who treated her, said: 'It was very serious. Katie actually was one step before full liver damage, liver failure, requiring liver transplant.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was able to recover in part because the liver is one of the few organs in the body that retains the ability to completely regenerate itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows a stock image of a turmeric supplement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amid her recovery from the ordeal, Mohan said: 'I'll never put another supplement in my body again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Describing her symptoms, she said: 'I just did not feel well generally. I also noticed that despite drinking a lot of water every day, that my urine was darker.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 11million Americans now take turmeric regularly, estimates suggest, particularly those who suffer from arthritis,  amid claims it can help to ease joint pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But amid the surge in popularity, there has also been an uptick in liver transplants due to supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study found that between 1995 and 2020, the number of people who suffered liver failure due to a supplement had surged eight fold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Turmeric supplements have exploded in popularity online amid claims the substance can reduce inflammation, ease pain, improve memory and even fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 20:32:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根据一项新的研究，适合您性格类型的最佳锻炼- EatingWell | The Best Exercise for Your Personality Type, According to a New Study - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxORGw5UlRjckNqY1oyQTlIYWlqbDlkWTIzS29JQk5RVDBUbE10NzRnckJIc3ctem1Ud3pDVTMycE5MOGJsa0hIWjI5VzZ3RUc1R1ZkU2F5X2MyY3BUcjEzY3lnT2pZQjZLY0ZHOTBuWkhCcjhKTjhHT3RnMHFzck1EV2Z2amNlaDJobDZQYVVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making exercise a regular habit can be difficult for many people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that tailoring it to your personality might help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You’re more likely to make exercise a habit if you enjoy doing it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Establishing new habits is hard (to say the least). It takes mindset work and consistent practice to make any new habit stick. But there are a few tricks that can be employed to help make the process easier—like working out according to your personality type. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from the United Kingdom sought to determine whether certain personality types were more drawn to or enjoyed specific intensities of exercise. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers initially recruited 132 participants from the general public for this study; 86 of the 132 completed the entire protocol. Participants first completed an online questionnaire that included demographic information, the Perceived Stress Scale 10 items (PSS-10), and a modified version of the Big Five Inventory 10 items (BFI-10). The PSS-10 is designed to assess people’s perceived stress levels, and the BFI-10 is a shortened version of a longer assessment for determining personality traits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The big five personality traits assessed with the BFI-10 include extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and openness&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Emotional stability relates to neuroticism. For example, people who score high in emotional stability are considered low in neuroticism. They tend to be calm and resilient with more positive attitudes and moods. People who score low in emotional stability tend to have more neurotic traits, including anxiety, irritability and moodiness, and tend to have stronger reactions to stress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following the online assessments, participants were brought into an exercise lab for baseline fitness testing. This included body composition, which is a measured ratio of lean tissue to fat tissue, and strength tests that included push-ups, planks and jumping in place with hands on hips. Participants’ aerobic capacities were also tested on a stationary bike, first with a “lab low-intensity” ride, and then, after a 30-minute rest, a high-intensity ride on the same bike was used to measure VO2peak. VO2peak is the highest oxygen consumption measured during an exercise test. It basically measures how efficiently your body is at using oxygen during intense exercise. After each exercise session, participants were asked to rate their level of enjoyment from 1 to 7, 1 being not enjoyable and 7 being extremely enjoyable. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following the baseline tests, participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The control group was instructed to maintain their normal lifestyle and was given a plan of weekly 10-minute stretching exercises. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The intervention group was provided with a heart rate monitor and a home-based 8-week cycling and strength training program that included “rides” of three varying intensities—low, threshold and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Each ride would be completed once per week for a total of three rides per week. The overall intensities gradually increased over the 8-week intervention. They were also instructed to do one &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7949443/best-strength-training-exercises/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strength training workout&lt;/a&gt; a week, which included 3 sets of 8 repetitions of squats, lunges, push-ups, sit-ups, calf raises and glute bridges. Participants were asked to rate their level of perceived enjoyment of each exercise session over the entire intervention period.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Extraversion was predictive of having higher VO2peak, anaerobic threshold and peak power output. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conscientiousness predicted completing push-ups, longer plank times, more weekly hours of physical activity and lower body fat percentage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neuroticism predicted poorer heart rate recovery times (how quickly your heart rate comes back down to pre-exercise levels), regardless of fitness level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those who were part of an endurance club (like a running club) were more extraverted and conscientious. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regarding &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;exercise enjoyment&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Those who scored higher in neuroticism reported less enjoyment of the low-intensity lab session and threshold ride.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extraversion predicted enjoyment of the VO2peak test and the HIIT sessions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both openness and agreeableness predicted more enjoyment for the long, easy ride.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regarding program adherence and participation:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Intervention group participants who scored higher in neuroticism were less likely to record their heart rate data during the 8-week intervention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extraverted participants were less likely to attend post-intervention testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those scoring high in openness were more likely to attend post-intervention testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 8-week intervention revealed that:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Those who scored high in neuroticism were the only ones who noted a decrease in stress from the intervention. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All participants in the intervention group, regardless of personality traits, exhibited a significant increase in weekly hours of exercise, VO2peak, peak power output, number of push-ups and duration of planks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conscientious participants showed smaller improvements in peak power output. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those with extraversion traits had a greater increase in RERpeak (respiratory exchange ratio, a measure of intensity and effort during an exercise test).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There were a few limitations to this study. First, 70% of the participants were found to be open-minded, conscientious and emotionally stable, presenting some bias in the sample of participants. While this study included the Big Five personality traits, it did not consider subtraits or other personality factors, like grit or anxiety. Lastly, this study only included cycling and body weight exercises. This limits participants’ responses to just those exercises. So if you already know you hate cycling, chances are you’re not going to enjoy any of the variations in intensity either. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that certain personalities may enjoy certain intensities of exercise more than others. "We found some clear links between personality traits and the type of exercise the participants enjoyed most,” says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/67380-flaminia-ronca" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Flaminia Ronca, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study authors in a press release, “which I think is important because we could potentially use this knowledge to tailor physical activity recommendations to the individual—and hopefully help them to become and remain more active."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who scored high in either neuroticism or extraversion:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Enjoyed the higher-intensity workouts more than the lower-intensity ones. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers note that those with neurotic tendencies may tolerate a HIIT workout better than a long, vigorous workout because the latter may allow for more anxiety, worry and negative self-talk to creep in and affect performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who scored high in conscientiousness:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Engage in physical activity for the health benefits. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They’re also goal-oriented. So if they’ve set a goal to complete 6 months of training for a marathon, they’re likely to achieve it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research offers a glimpse into the what and why of topics, you probably don’t need a personality test and a study to tell you what types of physical activity you find enjoyable. But these results do provide you with possible reasons why you might not enjoy certain types of physical activity. And you can now use your personality as the scapegoat if someone tries pushing you to do an activity you don’t like. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few other things to consider when finding activities that you’ll enjoy. For example, do you like doing things as a team or group, or are you more of an individual player? If you like doing things as a team, consider group fitness classes. Choose the type and intensity based on your personality and fitness level. Group personal training is another option. Or you can join a community sports team or running or cycling club.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re more independent and aren’t into the group thing, consider activities you can do on your own or with a friend. You may also enjoy one-on-one personal training. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that personality traits may determine which types of physical activities will be most enjoyable. Ultimately, the best types of physical activity for you are ones you’ll enjoy and stick with. And while guidelines are important—like getting a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week—any amount of physical activity is better than none, and it all counts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Start where you’re at and what you’re comfortable with, and make intentional decisions to move more throughout the day, even if it’s in small spurts. Over time, as your body gets used to moving more, you may naturally increase the amount. And before you know it, you’ll be crushing those guidelines (in a good way).

&lt;p&gt;A man in New South Wales (NSW) caught the state's first known case of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), a rabies-like infection that can't be treated once symptoms appear. It was the fourth human case of the infection ever documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man, who was in his 50s and from northern NSW, was in critical condition and being treated at a hospital on July 2, when NSW Health issued a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20250702_01.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20250702_01.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about his case. The next day, the health department announced that the man had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We express our sincere condolences to the man's family and friends for their tragic loss," an NSW Health spokesperson said July 3, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/breaking-news/nsw-man-dies-after-contracting-australian-bat-lyssavirus/news-story/78bd376d2da8aac790162c77581b906b" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/breaking-news/nsw-man-dies-after-contracting-australian-bat-lyssavirus/news-story/78bd376d2da8aac790162c77581b906b" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Australian&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the rabies virus, ABLV belongs to a genus of viruses called &lt;em&gt;Lyssavirus&lt;/em&gt;. "All&lt;em&gt; Lyssavirus&lt;/em&gt; species have the potential to cause rabies disease in people, but rabies virus is by far the most common cause," the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-risk/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-risk/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes. After exposure but prior to symptoms setting in, ABLV can be treated in the same way as rabies — namely, with rapid wound care and the administration of antibodies and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with rabies, ABLV infections are considered very rare.

In the man's case, he had "been bitten by a bat several months ago and received treatment following the injury," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Keira-Glasgow-2162878531" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Keira-Glasgow-2162878531" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Keira Glasgow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a director in health protection at NSW Health, said in the statement.

But NSW Health warned that any bat could potentially carry the germ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public is advised to avoid touching or handling bats at all. "Only people who have been vaccinated against rabies and who are trained in handling bats should ever handle bats or flying foxes," the department cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, if a bat bites or scratches a person, they should take these steps: Wash the wound with soap within 15 minutes, apply an antiseptic that kills viruses, and seek immediate medical attention, the department advises. Antibodies against rabies and a rabies vaccine would then be given, which can prevent rabies and other &lt;em&gt;Lyssavirus&lt;/em&gt;-related illnesses if symptoms have not yet emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once symptoms of ABLV set in, though, "sadly there is no effective treatment," Glasgow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms of ABLV infection resemble those of rabies and include flu-like symptoms of headache, fever and fatigue. The infection then rapidly progresses to affect the central nervous system, triggering paralysis, delirium, convulsions and death, typically within a few weeks of symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies and ABLV infections have "shown a wide variability in the time it takes for symptoms to appear following exposure to an infected animal (from several days to several years)," NSW Health noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-eVT6sTC2FyYw4CfnP9tDK6-8TRCCBKXJrM8dsFTa7urzoOqDwcSPP4q" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-eVT6sTC2FyYw4CfnP9tDK6-8TRCCBKXJrM8dsFTa7urzoOqDwcSPP4q slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
