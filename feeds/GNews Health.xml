&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Americans born in 1990 face a 4× higher risk of rectal cancer (and 2× higher for colon cancer) than those born in 1950.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Early-onset GI cancers rose 14.8% between 2010 and 2019; pancreatic rates climbed 4.34% per year in 25–29-year-olds.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Obesity (BMI ≥30), Western diets, and fatty liver disease drive most of these cancers, which are sporadic, not inherited.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Younger patients often face delayed diagnoses, more aggressive treatment with marginal benefit, and greater “financial toxicity.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOSTON —&lt;/strong&gt; Americans born in 1990 have four times the risk of developing rectal cancer compared to those born in 1950, according to a sweeping analysis that reveals how dramatically cancer patterns have shifted across generations. This alarming trend extends beyond a single cancer type; gastrointestinal cancers among people under 50 have surged by nearly 15% in just one decade, transforming diseases once considered rare in young people into leading killers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Journal of Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and led by researchers from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, the review examined cancer trends across multiple databases and studies. Between 2010 and 2019, cases of early-onset gastrointestinal cancers jumped by 14.8%, with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/colorectal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; now ranking as the top cancer killer for men under 50 and second for women in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of these cancers aren’t caused by inherited genetic defects. Instead, researchers point to environmental factors tied to modern life: soaring &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/obesity-causing-cancer-young-adults-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; rates, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/colorectal-cancer-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diets dominated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/processed-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sedentary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sedentary lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;, and exposures that previous generations simply didn’t face. “The rising incidence demonstrates a birth cohort effect, implicating environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increases hit certain groups hardest. Hispanic patients represent more than 22% of young adults diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stomach-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stomach cancer&lt;/a&gt;, compared to just 7% of older patients. Black, Hispanic, and indigenous populations face disproportionately higher rates of early-onset colorectal cancer compared to their White counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-cancer-rates-are-rising-in-young-adults"&gt;Why Cancer Rates Are Rising in Young Adults&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer incidence among Americans under 50 jumped from 5.9 cases per 100,000 people in 2000 to 8.4 cases per 100,000 by 2017. Among adults aged 25–29, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/pancreatic-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; incidence climbed by 4.34% per year beginning in the mid-1990s. Stomach cancer rates rose by 1.6% per year among women under 50 between 2010 and 2019, while &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/esophageal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;esophageal cancer&lt;/a&gt; cases increased by 6.86% per year in 30–39-year-olds and showed a steady early-onset rise overall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These patterns mirror troubling trends worldwide, particularly in wealthy nations where Western lifestyles have taken hold. European countries reported significant increases in early-onset colorectal cancer from 2004 to 2016, with the steepest rises — 7.9%, 4.9%, and 1.6% per year — among people in their twenties, thirties, and forties, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several key factors appear to drive this health emergency. Obesity emerges as perhaps the strongest risk factor. Studies consistently show that people with a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/bmi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt; of 30 or higher face nearly double the risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer. Diet plays an equally critical role: a Western eating pattern high in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/red-meat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt;, processed foods, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sugary-drinks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugar-sweetened drinks&lt;/a&gt;, and refined grains, while low in fruits and vegetables, has been linked to higher cancer risk. Heavy alcohol use and smoking further compound these effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/liver-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; represents another major factor largely absent in past generations. This condition, which affects roughly 25% of adults globally and has exploded alongside rising obesity, significantly increases gastrointestinal cancer risk even in people who aren’t severely overweight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unique-challenges-young-cancer-patients-face"&gt;Unique Challenges Young Cancer Patients Face&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond rising numbers, young adults with gastrointestinal cancers encounter challenges that older patients typically avoid. Diagnosis often comes later because neither patients nor doctors initially suspect cancer in someone so young. This delay frequently means the disease has progressed to more advanced stages by the time it’s detected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/young-adults-cancer-psychological/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Younger patients&lt;/a&gt; tend to receive more aggressive treatment than their older counterparts, even though research suggests this intensive approach doesn’t necessarily improve survival outcomes. Studies show that those under 50 are significantly more likely to receive chemotherapy and radiation, but show only marginal survival improvements compared to older patients receiving less intensive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financial devastation often follows diagnosis. Researchers have documented that younger cancer patients experience what they term “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/financial-toxicity-in-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;financial toxicity&lt;/a&gt;” at much higher rates than older patients. This stems partly from being in peak earning years while facing massive medical bills, and partly from having young families to support during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quality of life impacts can be particularly severe for younger patients. Treatments like pelvic radiation for rectal cancer can affect fertility, sexual function, and bowel control. These concerns are especially relevant for people who may have decades of life ahead of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer disparities along racial and ethnic lines are stark and getting worse. Analysis of California cancer registry data showed that Black Americans had an early-onset colorectal cancer rate of 12.2 per 100,000 compared to 9.2 per 100,000 for White Americans. Five-year survival rates range from 57.6% for Black patients to 69.1% for non-Hispanic White patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-healthcare-is-responding-to-rising-cancer-rates"&gt;How Healthcare Is Responding to Rising Cancer Rates&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Healthcare systems are racing to adapt to this new reality. In 2021, the United States lowered the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening from 50 to 45, but many experts worry this reactive approach isn’t sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current treatment guidelines don’t differentiate between young and older patients, despite growing evidence that early-onset cancers may behave differently at the molecular level. Young patients often have more aggressive disease features and different genetic profiles, yet they receive essentially the same treatment protocols developed primarily based on studies of older patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some promising developments offer hope. Recent clinical trials have shown that certain intensive treatments may be safely scaled back without compromising outcomes. This is particularly important for younger patients facing decades of potential treatment-related side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research efforts are now focusing intensively on understanding why certain birth cohorts face higher risks and identifying critical windows during childhood or adolescence when environmental exposures have the most lasting impact. Scientists are also working to develop prevention strategies and screening methods tailored specifically for younger populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, these medical advances won’t address the root causes driving this epidemic. As long as obesity rates continue climbing, diets remain dominated by processed foods, and sedentary lifestyles persist, the cancer rates documented in this review are likely to worsen rather than improve. Without dramatic changes to the environmental factors driving these increases, an entire generation faces rectal and other gastrointestinal &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer risks&lt;/a&gt; that previous generations never had to confront.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: This article summarizes a narrative review of existing studies and registry data; it does not constitute medical advice. Readers should consult healthcare professionals for personalized guidance on cancer risk and screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study represents a narrative review rather than original research with participants. The authors systematically analyzed existing research literature, cancer databases, and registry data to examine trends in early-onset gastrointestinal cancers, defined as those diagnosed before age 50. They reviewed epidemiological data from multiple sources including the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database, various national cancer registries, and published studies from around the world. The review focused on colorectal, esophageal, stomach, and pancreatic cancers, examining patterns in incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics, genetic features, and treatment outcomes. Rather than conducting new experiments, the researchers synthesized findings from hundreds of existing studies to provide a complete overview of this emerging health issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review documented consistent increases in early-onset gastrointestinal cancer rates globally, with the United States seeing a 14.8% increase between 2010 and 2019. The most striking finding was a birth cohort effect, where Americans born in 1990 face twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer compared to those born in 1950. While 10–25% of early-onset cases involve inherited genetic mutations, the majority are sporadic and linked to environmental factors including obesity, Western dietary patterns, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The increases disproportionately affect Black, Hispanic, and indigenous populations, with significant racial disparities in both incidence and survival rates. Younger patients typically present with more advanced disease stages and receive more intensive treatment than older patients, though survival outcomes vary across different studies and cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a narrative review synthesizing existing literature rather than conducting original research, this paper’s limitations stem from the quality and scope of the studies it analyzed. The authors noted that different studies use varying definitions of “early-onset” cancer, ranging from under 40 to under 60 years old, making direct comparisons challenging. Some cancer registries don’t consistently distinguish between different tumor subtypes, which can affect trend analyses. The review also acknowledged that deeper genomic characterization through whole exome or genome sequencing of large patient cohorts is needed to better understand the molecular differences between early-onset and average-onset cancers. Additionally, many of the risk factor associations come from observational studies rather than controlled trials, limiting the ability to establish definitive causal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s easy to grab when running out the door (late for something yet again), sweet enough to feel like a treat, and work well in recipes from smoothies to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a60100613/super-moist-banana-bread-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana bread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;banana bread&lt;/a&gt;. So when my editor asked me to eat a banana every day for a week and document how it made me feel, I was excited to take on the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, I know the importance of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. Fruits, including bananas, provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber our bodies need. Despite this, I will admit that there are days when I don’t quite meet my own fruit quota. So if anything, I figured taking on this challenge would help me get closer to eating enough fruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how my week with bananas unfolded and what I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened when I ate a banana every day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of this experiment, I reflected on how often bananas naturally made an appearance in my diet. I realized that while I wasn’t eating them daily, I did enjoy them in several forms—blended into smoothies, sliced over yogurt, or spread with peanut butter as a quick snack. I figured eating one each day wouldn’t be difficult, and I was curious to see if I’d notice any tangible benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next several days, I made a point to eat a banana a day. And honestly, it was easy to do, thanks to not needing refrigeration. Running to my car, I grabbed a banana to hang onto for when hunger pangs hit, and I was so happy I had it on hand when I got hungry. One day for dessert, I sliced a banana over &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ICELANDIC-PROVISIONS-Caramel-Banana-Creamy/dp/B0D9PC6JVW/ref=sr_1_1_f3_0o_wf?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65545332%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Icelandic Provisions salted caramel and banana skyr;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Icelandic Provisions salted caramel and banana skyr&lt;/a&gt; (tastes like banana pudding). And another day, I leaned on a classic peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich at lunchtime (with a glass of milk, of course!). It was very little effort to add a banana to my days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the week went on, I noticed some pleasant changes. My energy levels felt steadier, especially during the busy mid-morning hours when I’d usually start searching for a quick pick-me-up. Bananas gave me a satisfying boost without the jitters or crash I sometimes get from sugary snacks. I felt more satisfied and less likely to reach for less healthy options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digestively, things seemed to move along more smoothly, too. While the difference wasn’t extreme, it was certainly positive. I didn’t feel bloated like I do on occasion, and my bowel movements were regular. Plus, having that daily banana seemed to curb my sweet tooth, so I wasn’t tempted by mid-afternoon sweets as much. Overall, it was a simple change that left me feeling good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of eating bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas might seem basic, but they’re nutritional powerhouses. Here are some of the scientifically backed benefits of eating bananas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contains potassium&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium is a critical nutrient that &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supports heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;supports heart health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and helps maintain proper blood pressure. One medium banana provides about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:375 milligrams of potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;375 milligrams of potassium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it a great way to meet your daily needs of about 2,600–3,400 milligrams. If you struggle with muscle cramps after workouts or occasional fatigue, adequate potassium intake might help ease those symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aids digestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are an excellent source of dietary fiber, with one medium banana providing about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:3 grams of fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 grams of fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber plays a significant role in supporting regular bowel movements and promoting healthy gut bacteria. What’s more, slightly underripe bananas offer a unique benefit: They’re a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11167165/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:source of prebiotic fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;source of prebiotic fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Prebiotic fiber feeds the “good” bacteria in your gut, which supports a healthy digestive system and can improve overall gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good source of vitamin B6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One medium banana contains about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1105314/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:0.4 milligrams of vitamin B6;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;0.4 milligrams of vitamin B6&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is roughly 25% of the daily recommended intake for adults. The benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a64819302/vitamin-b6-vs-b12/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin B6;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt; are vast, but it particularly helps &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4772032/#:~:text=Beyond%20its%20role%20as%20a,noradrenaline%20and%20the%20hormone%20melatonin." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, aiding the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine that regulate mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provides energy boost without the crash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are predominantly made up of carbohydrates, with about&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4772032/#:~:text=Beyond%20its%20role%20as%20a,noradrenaline%20and%20the%20hormone%20melatonin." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:27 grams per medium banana;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt; 27 grams per medium banana&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to their natural sugars and the fiber they contain, bananas provide a steady source of energy, making them ideal before a workout or as a pick-me-up snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contains antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas contain several antioxidants, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10465879/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;including vitamin C&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals in the body, reducing oxidative stress and potentially lowering the risk of certain chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great for Hydration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because bananas are about &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:75% water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;75% water&lt;/a&gt;, they contribute to your overall hydration. Combining their potassium content with this water content makes them a fantastic post-workout snack to help replenish lost electrolytes and fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Banana nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A medium-sized banana is considered a single serving. Here’s the breakdown of what you get in &lt;a href="https://snaped.fns.usda.gov/resources/nutrition-education-materials/seasonal-produce-guide/bananas#:~:text=Serving%20Size%3A%201%20medium%20banana,105" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one medium banana:;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one medium banana:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 105&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates: 27 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber: 3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugars: 14 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 1 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat: 0.3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you eat too many bananas?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While bananas are packed with nutrients, like any food, they’re best enjoyed in moderation. Eating too many bananas in a short timeframe may result in an overload of certain nutrients, such as potassium. Though this is rare, too much potassium (a condition called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hyperkalemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hyperkalemia&lt;/a&gt;) can lead to issues like heart irregularities if your kidneys can’t process the excess properly, or even dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, eating one to two bananas a day is perfectly safe. If you focus on a balanced diet with a variety of fruits, it prevents overdoing any one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is bananas’ carbohydrate and sugar content. If you’re monitoring your blood sugar closely, be mindful of your portion size and pair bananas with some protein or fat, like almond butter or yogurt, to help support healthy blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to eat more bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re ready to increase your banana intake, there are plenty of easy (and delicious) ways to do it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoothies&lt;/strong&gt;: Slice a banana and toss it into your blender with yogurt, milk, and your favorite fruits for a quick breakfast or snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On toast&lt;/strong&gt;: Pair banana slices with nut butter on whole grain toast for a filling, balanced meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desserts&lt;/strong&gt;: Freeze ripe bananas to make creamy “nice cream” as a healthier alternative to ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baking&lt;/strong&gt;: Use mashed bananas in recipes like banana bread or muffins for natural sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toppings&lt;/strong&gt;: Add sliced bananas to your cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt for some extra flavor and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating a banana every day for a week, I can confidently say that incorporating a banana into your daily routine comes with some impressive benefits. They’re convenient, affordable, and packed with essential nutrients like B6 and C that can boost energy, support digestion, and enhance overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, balance and variety are key. I enjoy a wide range of fruits every day, including bananas, to ensure a diverse mix of nutrients. For those who don’t eat fruit regularly but enjoy bananas, they’re a simple, delicious, and budget-friendly way to start adding more nutrition to your diet. This versatile fruit truly punches above its weight!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 13:22:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1La1FKeEo0Q0pGUDRqZ3lnZS16eEVHMXlQNjNVOWJlZHZQTG5QU1RCZjZOZ191QXlMZC1GR05vQ0FQMlNVVlMyOFFBc3hnXzBFMU42ZEtOeUU3MjJkQkZldllsSUlPTVRCbUNLSQ</guid></item><item><title>4个简单的食物规则，以保持健康和长寿，其次是研究饮食和衰老的长寿医生-商业内幕</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNLWgyckYyRWNyVHJaYnQzUTAtZ3VoaUh1dDdlQjdNbGFQU3ViVlJVWVhrdklUbGE4T0pfV0JWOFp3c2RGOUs0aHBDVm5PR2lhX2NXckJ2M0RDYXdlUnR3TDlaUlJTNXlGemJ2MThvOHdOQWpSdnNfemZxYVE3eU1wN1ltU01GLV9TRXJVd0hhX2xac1BVSU12bnV0aTF6aUlI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story" data-track-marfeel="post-body-content"&gt;
            
                &lt;p&gt;As an obesity doctor, a nutrition researcher, and a professor of medicine and aging, Kurt Hong has dedicated his life to understanding the link between our &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/essential-healthy-habits-for-your-twenties-thirties-longevity-advice-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;diets and longevity&lt;/a&gt; and helping patients avoid diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his career isn't entirely selfless, he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I always joke with my wife that I also do this for selfish reasons," Hong said, "I'm always looking for ways to stay young."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the 52-year-old father of three, age is just a number thanks to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oral-microbiome-clean-teeth-live-longer-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;lifestyle choices &lt;/a&gt;we can make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your body may tell you you're 52 years old, but you can behave or you can feel like a 35-year-old," he said. "And it can be the other way around as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, "A lot of the age-related chronic diseases are directly related to what you eat and your weight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong's approach to harnessing our diets to age well is simple and centered on the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mediterranean-diet-best-healthy-eating-longevity-rankings-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;.

            &lt;p&gt;"The other part of it is that by getting your fruits and vegetables, you also get a lot of the vitamins," Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of evidence suggests that people who eat more plants are likely to be healthier than those who don't. In a 2019 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, which followed more than 12,000 people for 29 years, those who reported eating about four to five servings of plants a day, and little to no processed or red meat, were 18 to 25% less likely to die prematurely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;than those who relied more on meat and other animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0b3b83d4-7a88-4928-8daa-e08989ca76d5" data-toc-id="0b3b83d4-7a88-4928-8daa-e08989ca76d5"&gt;Eat a lot of fish&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hong's main source of animal protein is fish, because it's rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and protein.

But while proper hydration is important for your health and avoiding heat-related illness, doctors say that going about it the wrong way could mess with your stomach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Issues specifically show up in the form of acid reflux, aka gastroesophageal reflux. It seems weird, but drinking too much water or having water at certain times of day raises the risk of uncomfortable reflux symptoms, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/ashkan-farhadi" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ashkan Farhadi" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/ashkan-farhadi" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ashkan Farhadi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reason behind this is a little complicated and taps into body mechanics. But if you’re prone to reflux, it’s important to be aware that your summer hydration habits could be making things worse. With that in mind, we tapped four gastroenterologists to explain how water can exacerbate symptoms of reflux, plus how to stay well hydrated without raising the risk of symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, it’s important to understand why reflux happens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gastroesophageal reflux is a condition that happens when contents of your stomach come back up into your esophagus, the long tube that connects your throat to your stomach, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/acid-reflux-ger-gerd-adults/definition-facts" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/acid-reflux-ger-gerd-adults/definition-facts" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(NIDDK). Many people experience this once in a while, and you can even have reflux without noticing any symptoms. People who do have symptoms may experience heartburn, regurgitation, nausea, pain while swallowing, a chronic cough or hoarseness, per the NIDDK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastroesophageal reflux usually happens when the lower esophageal sphincter, which serves as a lid that keeps stomach acid and other contents from flowing back into the esophagus, becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn’t, Farhadi explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking too much water can exacerbate acid reflux symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to guzzle a bunch of water at once in the summer, but pacing yourself may be easier on your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drinking large amounts of water can increase the volume of the stomach,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.vanderbilthealth.com/doctors/naik-rishi" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Rishi Naik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.vanderbilthealth.com/doctors/naik-rishi" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Rishi Naik&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “When the volume of the stomach increases, it increases pressure, which then leads to upward pressure through your lower esophageal sphincter.” That can increase reflux, causing uncomfortable symptoms in the process, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Guido Mieth via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Guido Mieth via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Pacing your water intake can be easier on your stomach, experts say.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This esophageal sphincter acts like a valve to protect your esophagus from reflux but, when there is too much pressure, this can lead to backup through the valve into the esophagus which can worsen acid reflux symptoms,” Naik said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Water isn’t acidic, pointed out &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/subhankar-chakraborty-md-phd-99969" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Subhankar Chakraborty" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/subhankar-chakraborty-md-phd-99969" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Subhankar Chakraborty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.

But those with acid reflux are in trouble,” Farhadi said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing matters, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While flooding your stomach with a lot of water at once raises the risk of reflux, so does drinking a lot of water after a meal, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ellen Stein" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68838183e4b036c6e702ec95" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ellen Stein&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can easily overwhelm the stomach size and this can cause a rise in the fluid level that can produce more reflux symptoms,” she said. “It’s the same as over-eating or overfilling your stomach. It’s always better to be satiated, but not overfilled.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with reflux tend to have more symptoms after meals, so drinking too much water at this point can add to the problem, Chakraborty said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how to navigate summer hydration without acid reflux symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a few things you can do to lower the risk of acid reflux symptoms, both in terms of drinking water and other health hacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“To help prevent reflux, it’s better to drink small amounts of water throughout the day instead of drinking a lot at once, especially during or right after meals,” Chakraborty said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Naik also suggests walking after meals. “This increases motility — your ability for your stomach to squeeze — and moves [stomach contents] further down into your gastrointestinal tract to prevent esophageal reflux,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stein recommends being realistic about your hydration needs, too. “Drinking enough fluids in the day is not as hard as it sounds if you keep up from the start of the day to the end,” she said. Her advice: Drink when you feel thirsty, and try to have a steady amount of water throughout the day vs. downing a lot at once. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I usually remind people to drink a little when they wake up, have a little with breakfast, have a mid-morning sip, sip something with lunch, something in the afternoon, something with dinner, and something in the early evening,” she said. (You can keep an eye on your urine color to see if you’re well-hydrated: It should be clear to pale yellow.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Kahn, now 33, noticed a few bats flying around but didn’t worry about them — until one flew up to her and got tangled between her camera and her face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UKMNUD4HD5GNJI5ZQ5XTON4MME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She screamed, and part of the bat went into her mouth. She doesn’t know which part or for how long, though she estimates it was for only a few seconds. “It seemed longer,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QJLXANC3WBBSHCE6ZI5BRRNY5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The bat flew away, leaving Kahn shaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ALEJDVW7RZGE5MN6XWLEDCU6MU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She didn’t think the animal had bitten her. Regardless, her father, who is a physician and was traveling with her, said she should go to a hospital within a day or so and begin &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2021/09/29/illinois-rabies-bat/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinations against rabies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DYNKLD4L6RCMFMDBE7QK5V4GPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Figuring she would be covered as long as she obtained insurance before going to the hospital, Kahn said, she found a policy online the day after the bat incident. She said she called the company before she bought its policy and was told that services related to an accident or “life-threatening” emergency would be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7XNPVV723JDEXDU552QSADZ4KE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn went the next day to a hospital in Flagstaff, Arizona, where she started rabies prevention treatment. Over the next two weeks, she received the rest of the rabies shots at clinics in Arizona and Massachusetts and at a hospital in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="VXUACWC77VBCLMBXLOLHMAJWFM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="VXUACWC77VBCLMBXLOLHMAJWFM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The medical procedure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WTN3BXQCRRDCDI5R4KON4CJM3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn received a total of four doses of the rabies vaccine. The doses are administered over the course of 14 days.

Experts &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/prevention-recommendations/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommend precautionary measures&lt;/a&gt; when a person has been potentially exposed to rabies, because once the neurological disease causes symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;it is fatal&lt;/a&gt;. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says postexposure rabies treatment has reduced the number of human fatalities to fewer than 10 per year in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Y44O6TEG3VCPVLI6TSE7GDLAFU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Y44O6TEG3VCPVLI6TSE7GDLAFU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The final bill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QZI7JDIKTZGIBHEJNME6VZG364" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to explanation-of-benefits statements, Kahn owed a total of $20,749 for her care at the four facilities. Most of the charges were from the hospital where she was first treated, Flagstaff Medical Center: $17,079, including $15,242 for the rabies and immunoglobulin shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="I6EVS3MAMBEBHGCTXBP7ZXE244" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="I6EVS3MAMBEBHGCTXBP7ZXE244" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The billing problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VLQVCFEDX5BAVFJU63LBL4FK54" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn’s policy did not pay for any of the services. “The required waiting period for this service has not been met,” said an explanation-of-benefits letter she received in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YADQ5ILIFGP5KKWMKODOYYIDQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn was stunned. “I thought it must have been a mistake,” she said. “I guess I was naive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WRS3GFIOOVB2NI7GM4JMXLXOMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Kahn was laid off from her job as a biomedical engineer last summer, she had the option to temporarily stay on her former employer’s insurance under a COBRA plan, at a cost of about $650 per month. But as a young, healthy person, she gambled that she could get by without insurance until she found another job. She figured that if she needed medical care, she could quickly buy a private policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJODOWLT3FCTZNMVZPJCUDNCL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, those who qualify for COBRA must be given &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/cciio/programs-and-initiatives/other-insurance-protections/cobra_qna" target="_blank"&gt;at least 60 days&lt;/a&gt; to sign up — and if they do, the coverage applies retroactively. Kahn, who was still within that period at the time of the incident, said recently that she did not realize she had that option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="55UT7MC56NDHJD4AUJNXTKJHMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The policy she purchased after the bat episode, which cost about $311 a month, was from a Florida company called Innovative Partners LP. Documents Kahn provided to KFF Health News say the policy has a 30-day waiting period, which “does not apply to benefits regarding an accident or loss of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZSRHIY3TUNCW5LHWJ6ESAUMRRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn said that after receiving notice that her claims were denied, she called the company to ask how she could appeal and was told that a doctor would have to file paperwork. She said she wrote a letter that was signed by a doctor at Flagstaff Medical Center and submitted it in March but was unable to reach doctors at the other facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PM7PVOU3PFCZJL3T7APWC5ER4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kahn said she was given conflicting answers about where to send the paperwork.

Such plans have been around for decades and &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/short-term-health-plan-surprise-billing-7k-colonoscopy-bill-of-the-month-march-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;aren’t required to meet&lt;/a&gt; ACA standards, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K4N5IQO27REWVNES4N6YP3PWCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But she said even if Kahn had bought comprehensive health insurance, it probably wouldn’t have covered treatment received so soon after she had purchased it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FDV7B7O7WZDCPM5YMCLDI52R3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;David Shlim, a travel medicine specialist in Wyoming who studies rabies, said Kahn made the right choice by promptly seeking treatment, even though she didn’t feel the bat bite her. The disease is deadly, and the fact that the bat went into her mouth meant she could have been infected from its saliva, he said: “You could hardly have a more direct exposure than that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CZ5FJ4XTXRGPXHCQTMJLIWMRIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Shlim, who recently co-wrote &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/travel-associated-infections-diseases/rabies.html" target="_blank"&gt;a federal advisory about rabies prevention&lt;/a&gt;, added that healthy bats don’t normally fly into people, as the one in this case did.

But “after all those years of being sedentary, 10 minutes was a good start and that got me going,” Jones said. “Since they took it slow, it made it so that we didn’t get discouraged. We didn’t hurt ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ESXIQLLVSNC6PGVLPAK5B7OHJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Since then, she has lost 30 pounds, Jones said.

&lt;p&gt;On a recent weekday evening, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashly-richards-1610aa44/"&gt;Ashly Richards&lt;/a&gt; helped her 13-year-old son, Case, with homework. He did math problems and some reading, underscoring how much he’s accomplished at his school for children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Richards has heard Trump administration officials suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNeIZkacWkk"&gt;food dyes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZofNzZ8UoPk"&gt;pediatric vaccines&lt;/a&gt; cause autism and ADHD. That stance, she said, unfairly blames parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s no evidence to support it,” said Richards, 44, a marketing director in Richmond, Virginia. “As a parent, it’s infuriating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their zeal to “Make America Healthy Again,” Trump administration officials are making statements that some advocacy and medical groups say depict patients and the doctors who treat them as partly responsible for whatever ails them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and agency leaders have attributed a panoply of chronic diseases and other medical issues — such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, diabetes, and obesity — to consumers and their lifestyle choices, according to a review of 15 hours of recorded interviews, social media statements, and federal reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said at a news conference on April 16 that &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/apr/24/RFK-jr-environmental-toxins-causing-autism/"&gt;autism is preventable&lt;/a&gt; and that rates are rising because of toxic substances in the environment, despite a lack of evidence there is any link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are kids who will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date,” he said. “Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of people on the spectrum do not have those severe challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statements are more than rhetoric. These attitudes, ranging from judgments about individual behaviors to criticism of the chronically poor, are shaping policies that affect millions of people. The sentiments have been a factor behind decisions to cut Medicaid, keep federal insurance programs from covering anti-obesity drugs, and impose new barriers to covid vaccines for healthy people, say public health leaders and doctors. GOP lawmakers and federal health officials, they say, hold a reproachful stance toward chronic illnesses and the estimated 129 million people in the U.S. affected by them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is at the heart of so much of our national problem with health,” said Robert Califf, who led the Food and Drug Administration during the Obama and Biden administrations. “It’s these two extreme views. It’s every health decision is up to the ‘rugged individual,’ versus the other extreme view that it’s all controlled by environment and social determinants of health. The truth is, it’s on a continuum.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Blame Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Self-reliance is a common theme among adherents of MAHA, an informal movement for which Kennedy has fashioned himself the figurehead that promotes medical freedom, skepticism of vaccines, and a focus on nontraditional medicine to treat disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking medication to manage diabetes? FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested on &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-f-kennedy-jrs-fda-commissioner-marty-makarty-suggests-diabetics-get-cooking-classes-over-insulin/"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in late May that it would be effective to “treat more diabetes with cooking classes” instead of “just throwing insulin at people.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their pancreases don’t produce it, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/insulin-medicines-treatments#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20type%201,another%20option%20for%20some%20people."&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, which also notes that many with Type 2 diabetes “need to take diabetes medicines as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking birth control pills? Casey Means, President Donald Trump’s nominee to be U.S. surgeon general, has said that’s a “disrespect of life” for short-term gain and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are prescribing them like candy,” she said last year on “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUH4Co2wE-I"&gt;The Tucker Carlson Show&lt;/a&gt;,” adding that birth control medications “are literally shutting down the hormones in the female body that create this cyclical, life-giving nature of women.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Have a child on ADHD meds? &lt;a href="https://calleymeans.com/"&gt;Calley Means&lt;/a&gt;, who is an adviser to Kennedy and is Casey Means’ brother, said on the same show that Adderall is prescribed as the standard of care when children get a little fidgety because they’re in sedentary environments with limited sunlight and eat too much ultraprocessed food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a society, he said, “we’re really committing mass child abuse in many ways, and we’re normalizing that and we’re not speaking out about that. And then we’re giving people stimulants developed by Nazi Germany.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calley Means was probably referring to Pervitin, a &lt;a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/the-nazi-death-machine-hitler-s-drugged-soldiers-a-354606.html"&gt;methamphetamine-based&lt;/a&gt; drug administered to Adolf Hitler’s forces in World War II. Adderall is a prescription drug containing amphetamine, a stimulant that’s &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/how-do-adderall-and-meth-methamphetamine-differ#differences"&gt;not the same&lt;/a&gt; as methamphetamine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services didn’t respond to messages seeking comment from Means.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some conservatives and MAHA adherents argue that people need to take more responsibility for their health. But comments that shift blame to patients and physicians risk perpetuating stigmas, fostering the spread of misinformation, and eroding trust in modern medicine, say medical groups, doctors, and patient advocacy groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statements assume consumers and patients have control over improving their health and preventing chronic disease when the reality is more complex, according to some public health leaders. Lower-income people, they say, often lack access to grocery stores and healthy food, may juggle too many jobs to have time to cook from scratch, and may live in dangerous areas where it’s harder to get outside and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.uschamberfoundation.org/surgeongeneral/680209"&gt;Jerome Adams&lt;/a&gt;, surgeon general during the previous Trump administration, told KFF Health News that he worries efforts to promote health will be undone by “the return of vaccine-preventable diseases, increasing mistrust in the health care system, and the tearing down of social supports which are critical for making healthy choices.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tough Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attitudes held by top Trump health officials have affected policy decisions, some doctors and public health leaders say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and other Trump administration health leaders have been especially outspoken, targeting issues they consider especially egregious in recent federal actions, research, or policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the Biden administration proposed &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-announces-medicare-advantage-and-medicare-part-d-prescription-drug"&gt;a rule&lt;/a&gt; in November that would let Medicare cover weight loss medications such as Wegovy and Zepbound. But Kennedy and other political appointees at HHS and its agencies have criticized the drugs and the people who take them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s very dark,” Calley Means &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUH4Co2wE-I"&gt;told Carlson&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the weight loss drugs. “I think it’s a stranglehold on the U.S. population, almost like solidifying this idea that there is a magic pill.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added: “Where is the urgency on saying ‘Hey parents, maybe we shouldn’t feed our kids toxic food?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, too, has criticized the medications and people who use them, saying in October on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertfkennedyjr/reel/DBWPFf4PmFV/"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; that drugmakers “are counting on selling it to Americans because we’re so stupid and so addicted to drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April, the Trump administration announced it would not finalize the Biden-era coverage rule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s impacting the kind of care and treatments patients will have,” said Andrea Love, a biomedical scientist and founder of ImmunoLogic, a science communication organization. “It sends the message that it’s your fault. It’s very much victim-blaming. It creates the idea that scientific progress is the devil, demonizes things that aren’t individually harming health, while avoiding addressing systemic issues that play a much larger role in health.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and HHS didn’t return messages seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data shows that the medications are effective. People who took the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/zepbound-explained-glp-1-weight-loss-drug-fda-approval#:~:text=The%20FDA%20approval%20of%20Zepbound,25%25%20of%20their%20body%20weight."&gt;highest dose of Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; in clinical trials lost an average of 48 pounds, and 1 in 3 on that dose lost more than 58 pounds, or 25% of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and other agency leaders also oppose many covid-era health restrictions and rules. Some physicians and public health leaders note these officials downplayed covid risks while criticizing vaccines developed during the previous Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has said that people who died from covid actually fell victim to chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, or asthma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s really what killed them,” Kennedy said on “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZofNzZ8UoPk"&gt;Dr. Phil Primetime&lt;/a&gt;” in April. “These were people who were so sick they were basically hanging from a cliff, and covid came along and stamped on their fingers and dropped them off. But they were already living lives that were burdened by sickness.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Covid was the underlying cause of death for more than &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800816"&gt;940,000 people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. from Aug. 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, according to a 2023 report in JAMA Network, an open-access journal on biomedical sciences published by the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Covid ranked first among deaths caused by infectious or respiratory diseases for youths under age 19, based on the report. Infants under a year old may be at higher risk of experiencing severe illness from covid compared with older children, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-in-babies-and-children/art-20484405"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;, and risks are also higher for infants under 6 months and those with underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/protecting-infants-and-children-from-covid-19-associated-hospitalization.html"&gt;Vaccination during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; can help protect infants after birth,” according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy announced in May that the federal government would no longer recommend covid vaccines for pregnant people and children who are healthy. Medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics opposed this decision and filed a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also helped promote beliefs that many childless adults on Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people, don’t work and thereby drain resources from the program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a May hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Kennedy said the program was in jeopardy because of “all the able-bodied people who are not working [or] looking for jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a view embraced by Republican lawmakers who portrayed adults enrolled in Medicaid as lazy or shirking work as they advanced a budget bill estimated to cut federal spending on the program by about $1 trillion over a decade, in part by imposing work requirements on many adult beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Thirty-five-year-olds sitting at home playing video games, they’re going to now have to go get a job,” said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The legislation, which Trump signed into law this month, will cause about 10 million more people to be without health insurance by 2034, &lt;a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61569"&gt;the Congressional Budget Office estimates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health leaders who criticized the legislation say the statements inaccurately maligned Medicaid enrollees, who by law cannot hold high-paying jobs and remain in the program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, nearly two-thirds of adults ages 19 to 64 covered by Medicaid in 2023 were working. For about 3 in 10, caregiving responsibilities, an illness or disability, or school attendance prevented them from working, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work-an-update/"&gt;according to KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s using anti-welfare tropes for something that is basic health care, not a cash benefit,” said Anthony Wright, executive director at Families USA, which supports the Affordable Care Act and expanded health coverage. He summarized the Republican message: “We’re going to make it harder to get the help you need by imposing a bunch of paperwork, and if you don’t get it, it’s your fault.”&lt;/p&gt;

There are plenty of ways to work this tip into your diet, from kimchi and sauerkraut to yogurt and kombucha. If you don't think of yourself as a person who enjoys the funky tang of condiments like miso or kraut, you could opt for a serving of kefir or mix your favorite fruit with ice and yogurt for a quick smoothie.

Don't Count Calories—But Eat More Plants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Stop counting calories," Bulsiewicz says. "Start counting plants. Enough with the dietary restrictions—let's live a life of abundance with as many different varieties of plants as possible."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We couldn't agree more with this plant-focused advice. There are so many health benefits to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating a plant-based diet&lt;/a&gt;, but an eating pattern made up of predominantly plants with occasional servings of meat or animal products can also be beneficial. That kind of plant-focused diet, which is less stringent than a plant-based one, could be especially good for your heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-diversify-your-plate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Diversify Your Plate &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sometimes the oldest advice is still the best. Eating lots of different kinds of foods—veggies, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats and heart protein—from meal to meal is a great way to make sure you're getting the nutrients you need to thrive as well as delicious, varied meals that won't get you stuck in a dinner rut. (That principle is just part of the reason we love &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290484/why-the-mediterranean-diet-is-so-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; so much.) A mix-and-match option like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290800/the-best-no-recipe-formula-for-making-easy-veggie-packed-sheet-pan-dinners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;sheet-pan dinner formula&lt;/a&gt; is a simple way to start mixing up your dinner-time routine, and those recipe ideas will ensure that you at least get some protein and veggies on your plate. You could also lean on easy, pile-it-on bowls to get in all those necessary nutrients. Recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7960938/salmon-rice-bowl/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Salmon Rice Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7965658/vegetarian-protein-bowl/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Vegetarian Protein Bowl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7965781/cilantro-lime-shrimp-bowl/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Cilantro-Lime Shrimp Bowl&lt;/a&gt; are customizable and low-effort, so you can eat diverse foods without adding tons of cooking time to your schedule.

Wear Blue Light-Blocking Glasses Before Bed &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You might be surprised to see this tip show up on a list focused on healthy eating, but research has shown that your exposure to blue light just before bed can have quite an impact on your health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Blue light stimulates your brain—yup, even when you're sleeping—so donning blue light-blocking glasses can help you wind down at the end of the day and get better sleep. If you need helpful lenses before bed to read, keep an eye out for blue light-blocking readers or even splurge for a blue light filter on your next pair of prescription eyeglasses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supporting your gut health doesn’t have to mean overhauling your entire routine. Simple, daily habits—like adding more plants to your plate, enjoying fermented foods and limiting nighttime blue light—can go a long way. The key is consistency and variety. Start small, listen to your body and build a gut-friendly lifestyle that works for you.

Analyzing a separate breast cancer database from the United States, including nearly 37,000 patients, they discovered that a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a greater than 40 percent increased risk of metastatic breast cancer in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in mice suggest that viruses might be behind the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="169587" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Influenza&lt;/a&gt; and SARS-CoV-2 infections triggered dormant breast cancer cells in mice to proliferate after only days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within two weeks, there was "a massive expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions" by more than 100-fold, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09332-0"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors, led by molecular geneticist Shi Chia from the University of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although species differences warrant caution in interpreting mouse data… collectively, these findings underscore the substantial metastatic risk COVID-19 posed to cancer survivors," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09332-0"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169598" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169598" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer-642x247.png" alt="Dormant Breast Cancer Cells" class="wp-image-169598 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer-642x247.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer-1024x394.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer-768x295.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer-600x231.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ViralInfectionCancer.png 1488w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169598" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Viruses increase IL-6 and contribute to the awakening and expansion of dormant mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells (DCC).

That's why the HPV vaccine has proved &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/young-american-deaths-from-cervical-cancer-fall-sharply-after-hpv-vaccine"&gt;so life-changing&lt;/a&gt; for millions. It prevents deadly, viral-associated diseases, like cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1936, scientists have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers2020752"&gt;searching&lt;/a&gt; for a virus that triggers breast cancer in a similar way, mostly in mice and human population studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-risk viruses have been detected in human breast cancer samples. EBV, for instance, is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13027-021-00366-3"&gt;five times higher&lt;/a&gt; in breast cancer tissue than in normal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the idea that viruses may predispose us to cancer is plausible, research in human cells is limited, and the mechanism underlying the disease spread remains undetermined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system's response to viruses could possibly play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After initial remission, a tiny number of breast cancer cells can remain dormant in lung, bone, and liver tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, inflammation can wake these cancer cells up – and viral respiratory infections, like the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="169587" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; and COVID-19, can cause inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current mouse experiments, the influenza A virus only reawakened dormant cancer cells in the lung if they triggered an increase in inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same was true of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="169587" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that the immune system's response to viruses breeds the perfect environment for cancer to proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What our data suggest is that if you are a cancer patient who has these dormant cells, you may end up living a normal life and dying with these dormant cells, instead of dying because those dormant cells awakened," &lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/cancer-center/covid-19-awaken-dormant-cancer-cells"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; DeGregori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But if you get a respiratory virus like influenza or COVID, your chance of dying from those dormant cells awakening is much greater."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that's true, then it will be vital to protect the millions of breast cancer survivors out there who may face an increased risk of relapse if they get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to see if vaccination against influenza or COVID-19 can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09332-0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

According to Market Research Future, that number is projected to rise to $2.6billion by 2034.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the number of Americans &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14905141/I-diagnosed-IBS-20-discovered-devastating-truth-decades-later.html"&gt;searching online for information&lt;/a&gt; on hemorrhoids increased five-fold &lt;span&gt;between 2004 and 2023, a DailyMail.com analysis of Google Trends found.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hemorrhoids can be caused by many things, including straining during bowel movements, constipation, heavy lifting, sitting for long periods of time and pregnancy, but experts are increasingly pointing to phone use in the bathroom as a major culprit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2021 survey revealed about three-quarters of Americans bring their phones with them into the bathroom.

Among 18- to 29-year-olds, this jumped to nearly all respondents &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 66 percent of respondents used smartphones while on the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority (93 percent) of those used a smartphone on the toilet at least one to two times per week or more, and more than half (55 percent) used it most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smartphone use on the toilet was associated with a 46 percent increased risk for hemorrhoids after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, exercise activity, and fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who used smartphones on the toilet spent significantly more time there than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than a third (37 percent) of them spent more than six minutes per bathroom visit on the toilet compared with seven percent of nonusers, and 35 percent said they believed they spent more time on the toilet because of their smartphone use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2021 study found 73 percent of people bring their phone with them into the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This number climbed further when it came to younger people aged 18 to 29, with 93 percent of this age group admitting to using their phones on the toilet, regardless of gender. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although there is no universally agreed 'safe' length of time to spend on the toilet, most gastroenterologists agree that if a bowel movement doesn't happen within five to 10 minutes, it's best to get up, move around and try again later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Going for a short walk or gently moving the body can help stimulate bowel motility naturally, without the need to strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

&lt;p data-start="245" data-end="521"&gt;We all know someone who seems to defy the rules of time. Maybe it’s your friend’s mom who looks like their older sister. Or that skincare YouTuber who’s pushing 50 but could easily pass for 30. While genetics certainly play a role, lifestyle habits often do the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="523" data-end="777"&gt;As someone who’s spent countless hours sampling vegan collagen snacks and decoding what kombucha brews say about your gut health, I’ve come to appreciate how much our daily rituals shape how we age—not just inside, but in our skin, our posture, our glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="779" data-end="909"&gt;So if you’re looking to maintain that youthful spark—whether you’re 28 or 58—here are 7 habits it might be time to say goodbye to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="If you want to look and feel younger in 60 days, say goodbye to these 7 habits" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfC9c6cD9hk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="916" data-end="966"&gt;1. &lt;strong data-start="923" data-end="966"&gt;Neglecting Your Sleep Like It’s a Trend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="968" data-end="1020"&gt;Sleep isn’t a luxury—it’s a regenerative powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1022" data-end="1213"&gt;Every night you cut short your rest, you’re essentially delaying your body’s natural repair cycle. That means slower collagen production, less skin hydration, and more pronounced fine lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1215" data-end="1381"&gt;I get it—those 2AM deep dives into K-drama fan theories or scrolling through ‘90s shoegaze vinyl on eBay can be irresistible. But your skin (and brain) pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1383" data-end="1641"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1383" data-end="1394"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="1394" data-end="1397"&gt;Commit to 7–9 hours of sleep and protect it like your favorite playlist. Dim the lights an hour before bed. Trade late-night screens for a relaxing wind-down routine—maybe a reishi hot cocoa, a journal entry, or some lo-fi beats and breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="1648" data-end="1701"&gt;2. &lt;strong data-start="1655" data-end="1701"&gt;Eating Like You’re Still in Your Dorm Room&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1703" data-end="1894"&gt;Let’s talk diet. If your daily intake still revolves around processed snacks, sugary drinks, and takeout fries—your skin and organs might be aging faster than your birth certificate suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1896" data-end="2083"&gt;These foods create chronic inflammation, spike insulin, and reduce your body’s natural ability to repair oxidative damage. Translation: more wrinkles, duller skin, and a tired appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2085" data-end="2248"&gt;As someone who’s reviewed more vegan snacks than I can count, I can confirm: there are nutrient-rich options out there that taste amazing and support glowing skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2250" data-end="2512"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2250" data-end="2261"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="2261" data-end="2264"&gt;Nourish your body with vibrant whole foods. Think rainbow salads, fermented goodies like kimchi, and omega-rich bites like walnuts and chia seeds. Antioxidants—especially from berries, leafy greens, and green tea—are your best friends in this game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="2519" data-end="2568"&gt;3. &lt;strong data-start="2526" data-end="2568"&gt;Treating Skincare Like an Afterthought&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2570" data-end="2715"&gt;No shame if your routine used to consist of a 3-in-1 body wash. But if you want to look fresh in your 40s and beyond, now’s the time to level up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2717" data-end="2873"&gt;UV exposure, pollution, and stress all speed up skin aging. A minimalist but consistent skincare routine can go a long way in preserving your youthful glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2875" data-end="3097"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2875" data-end="2886"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="2886" data-end="2889"&gt;Start with a good cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF. (Yes, SPF—even on cloudy days, even if you’re just inside working by a window.) Bonus points for a gentle exfoliant and a serum with vitamin C or niacinamide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3099" data-end="3199"&gt;And no, your skincare doesn’t need to cost as much as a front-row concert ticket—just be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="3206" data-end="3258"&gt;4. &lt;strong data-start="3213" data-end="3258"&gt;Dismissing Hydration Like It’s a Buzzword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3260" data-end="3432"&gt;Dehydration isn’t just about feeling thirsty. It’s also about what happens to your skin, organs, and metabolism when you’re not giving your body enough water to do its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3434" data-end="3517"&gt;Dry, flaky skin? Sunken eyes? Lackluster energy? All signs you might need more H2O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3519" data-end="3756"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3519" data-end="3530"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="3530" data-end="3533"&gt;Start your morning with a tall glass of water (bonus: add lemon and sea salt for electrolytes). Sip throughout the day—not just when you’re parched. Herbal teas and water-rich fruits like cucumbers and watermelon also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3758" data-end="3871"&gt;And maybe, just maybe, trade one of those extra iced lattes for a refreshing green juice or a hibiscus cold brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="3878" data-end="3925"&gt;5. &lt;strong data-start="3885" data-end="3925"&gt;Stressing Like It’s a Badge of Honor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3927" data-end="4186"&gt;We live in a culture that glamorizes the hustle—but chronic stress literally breaks down your body’s youth-preserving mechanisms. It increases cortisol, which accelerates collagen loss, dehydrates the skin, and even shrinks your brain over time (not kidding).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4188" data-end="4377"&gt;As someone who’s juggled deadlines, creative blocks, and the chaos of launching a podcast about vegan food trends—I know how tempting it is to normalize the pressure. But peace is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4379" data-end="4630"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4379" data-end="4390"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="4390" data-end="4393"&gt;Make space for joy and decompression. Meditate, go for walks, listen to music that fills you up (might I suggest the latest Men I Trust release?), or try journaling. Protect your nervous system like it’s the last kombucha scoby on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="4637" data-end="4696"&gt;6. &lt;strong data-start="4644" data-end="4696"&gt;Forgetting to Move Your Body (Beyond the Scroll)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4698" data-end="4919"&gt;Movement isn't just about aesthetics—it’s about circulation, posture, and mood. A sedentary lifestyle slows your metabolism, reduces lymphatic drainage (read: puffiness), and contributes to that sluggish, “older” feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4921" data-end="5035"&gt;You don’t need to become a CrossFit warrior to reap the benefits. Just find movement that sparks something in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5037" data-end="5251"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5037" data-end="5048"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="5048" data-end="5051"&gt;Dance. Stretch. Bike to your local farmers market. Take the stairs. Join a beginner K-pop dance class just for the fun of it (yes, you can). The key is to get your blood flowing and your body aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5253" data-end="5352"&gt;When you move regularly, it shows—especially in the bounce in your step and the light in your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5359" data-end="5425"&gt;7. &lt;strong data-start="5366" data-end="5425"&gt;Holding On to Negativity Like It’s Your Favorite Hoodie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5427" data-end="5523"&gt;This might sound woo-woo, but hear me out: your mental and emotional state affects how you look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5525" data-end="5727"&gt;People who hold onto resentment, complain constantly, or stay locked in pessimism often carry it in their face, their energy, and even their body language. It’s like a shadow dulling your natural shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5729" data-end="5829"&gt;Ever notice how people who radiate joy seem to glow, regardless of their age? That’s no coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5831" data-end="6055"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5831" data-end="5842"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="5842" data-end="5845"&gt;Practice gratitude—even if it’s just one thing a day. Release what doesn’t serve you. Surround yourself with people who uplift you. Laugh more. Forgive quicker. Let go of the old stories that wrinkle your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6062" data-end="6101"&gt;Final Thoughts: Glow Is a Lifestyle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6103" data-end="6279"&gt;Staying youthful isn’t about Botox or miracle serums—it’s about the choices we make every day. From what we eat to how we rest to how we treat ourselves when no one’s watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6281" data-end="6442"&gt;I’ll leave you with this: Aging is a privilege. But showing up for yourself in a way that lets you age with vitality and style? That’s a flex worth striving for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6444" data-end="6619"&gt;So go ahead—ditch the habits that drag you down. Drink your water, take that dance class, eat your fermented tofu snack, and wear sunscreen like it’s part of your personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6621" data-end="6653"&gt;Your future self will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wisdom comes with age. But flexibility? It feels like we lose a little limberness every year — and that can come with some (*ahem*) stiff consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just that you can’t do the splits or touch your toes like you used to. Having tighter muscles can affect your ability to navigate day-to-day life, something you may have already started to feel if you have a job that requires a lot of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there’s one easy thing you can do to combat this: stretch your hip flexors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all types of stretches are good for your body, focusing on your hip flexors is especially important to maintain mobility as you get older. Tight hip flexors can cause lower back pain and muscle fatigue and stretching them can improve balance and resolve other issues, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7922112/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916072" data-affiliate="true"&gt;a 2021 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fyzical.com/fort-myers-fl/About/Staff" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916072" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Gavin Hamer&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist and the national director of clinical education at &lt;a href="https://www.fyzical.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916072" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Fyzical Therapy &amp;amp; Balance Centers&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost that “stretching will positively affect the joints, ligaments, and muscles around the hip.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flexible muscles are less likely to become strained, and mobile joints are kept healthy by improving circulation and lubrication,” Hamer added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, flexible hips lead to “greater stride length and more effective reactions to balance challenges,” according to Hamer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do We Lose Flexibility? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New HIV vaccines have shown promise in studies with lab animals and human volunteers, pointing to a potential way of preventing the lifelong viral disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experimental vaccines are built upon mRNA technology and several triggered potent immune responses in these early tests, while also causing few side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists described the new vaccines in a pair of studies published Wednesday (July 30) in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adw0721" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adw0721" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first study tested&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a few vaccines in rabbits and monkeys, and the promising results of that work led to further development of the shots and the subsequent human trial.

Globally, an estimated 1.3 million people acquired HIV in 2024, including about 120,000 children. An HIV vaccine could be transformative if, in just a few doses, it could raise the immune system's ability to block the virus from taking hold in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/nearly-3-million-extra-deaths-by-2030-could-result-from-hiv-funding-cuts-study-suggests" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/nearly-3-million-extra-deaths-by-2030-could-result-from-hiv-funding-cuts-study-suggests"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nearly 3 million extra deaths by 2030 could result from HIV funding cuts, study suggests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rP5BeubJnNYcto5sG28SQ6" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rP5BeubJnNYcto5sG28SQ6 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, preventive medications for HIV must be taken on an ongoing basis — either &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/using-hiv-medication-to-reduce-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/using-hiv-medication-to-reduce-risk/pre-exposure-prophylaxis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;daily, every other month or twice yearly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This can pose a particular challenge in areas with limited health care resources and infrastructure. Many scientists think a vaccine will be the key to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/we-could-end-the-aids-epidemic-in-less-than-a-decade-heres-how" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/we-could-end-the-aids-epidemic-in-less-than-a-decade-heres-how"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic worldwide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, because such a tool could efficiently stymie new infections and curb further spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But crafting an HIV vaccine is very challenging. The virus expertly evades the immune system by donning disguises, and it mutates rapidly, constantly switching up its look. Ideally, HIV vaccines will trigger the production of elusive "broadly neutralizing antibodies" — proteins that target relatively immutable bits of the virus that look similar across many strains and can block infections, thus offering wide-ranging protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are exploring different strategies to trigger that protection. On that front, the researchers behind the new studies turned to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/coronavirus/nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-scientists-who-paved-the-way-for-covid-19-mrna-vaccines" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/coronavirus/nobel-prize-in-medicine-goes-to-scientists-who-paved-the-way-for-covid-19-mrna-vaccines"&gt;&lt;u&gt;messenger RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (mRNA), a molecule that serves as instructions for cells to make proteins. They designed their experimental vaccines to carry directions for a complex of proteins found on the surface of HIV. Called the "envelope trimer," this complex enables the virus to grab the surface of human immune cells and invade those cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once injected into the body, the vaccines prompt cells to build one of two versions of the envelope trimer: one that exits the cell and floats away, and another that stays bound to the surface of the cell. The free-floating version has been targeted in prior HIV vaccines studies, but previously hasn't produced adequate neutralizing antibodies, the study authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They think this is because, on the surface of a real HIV particle, the base of the trimer is embedded inside the virus and thus hidden from view. They anticipated that the latter version of the trimer — the one that stays stuck to the cell — would trigger better neutralizing responses that take aim at other parts of the complex, rather than the base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That turned out to be the case in both the animal study and the early clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05217641" target="_blank" data-url="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05217641" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;For the human trial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers recruited 108 healthy people ages 18 to 55, split them into three groups, and gave each group one of three mRNA vaccines. One vaccine encoded a free-floating trimer, while the latter two encoded different bound versions of the structure. Each participant received three doses of their assigned vaccine: one at the initial visit, another two months later, and a final dose six months after the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in the animal tests, the bound trimers elicited stronger signs of protection than the free-floating trimer did. The bound-trimer vaccines produced neutralizing antibodies in 80% of those vaccinated, while the free-floating-trimer vaccine triggered the same response in only 4% of the recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/in-a-1st-hiv-vaccine-triggers-rare-and-elusive-antibodies-in-human-patients" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/hiv/in-a-1st-hiv-vaccine-triggers-rare-and-elusive-antibodies-in-human-patients"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a 1st, HIV vaccine triggers rare and elusive antibodies in humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bound-trimer vaccines also "generated strong memory responses, meaning the body would be better prepared to fight off HIV even long after vaccination," Cheetham noted. This would be thanks to antibody-producing memory B cells, which persist for a long time to help mount quick immune responses against germs they've encountered in the past, either through infection or vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human trial was primarily designed to look at the safety of the vaccines, and they were "well tolerated overall." They triggered mostly mild and transient side effects, such as fatigue, achiness, headache, chills, nausea and injection-site pain. However, hives, also called urticaria, were seen in seven participants, which the authors noted was "a far higher frequency than reported with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines." Several of the affected individuals experienced the skin reaction for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While most adverse reactions were mild and treatable, several people experienced a skin reaction," Cheetham said. "If these side effects can be reduced in next-generation versions and the results hold up in larger real-world studies in the community, mRNA vaccines could be a transformative tool in the fight against HIV."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial had several other limitations. First, it was open-label, meaning the researchers and vaccine recipients knew which shots were being given, which can potentially bias the results. In addition, the vaccines were not specifically designed to make broadly neutralizing antibodies that can handle many strains but rather neutralizing antibodies that can tackle only select strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the trial results provide insight into the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines that code for HIV envelope trimers, the researchers noted. It should inform future efforts to refine these vaccines so they trigger more broadly protective antibody responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-rP5BeubJnNYcto5sG28SQ6-MriGtBfrG1608Ug1An2fNVxmBZvGiS1r" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-rP5BeubJnNYcto5sG28SQ6-MriGtBfrG1608Ug1An2fNVxmBZvGiS1r slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At this appointment, she also got Dysport, which is similar to Botox, for the first time.  Both injectables are formulated from the toxin that causes botulism to paralyze the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately after her appointment, Wolaver claims she developed a migraine. The next day, she went to the hospital when she “couldn't function or string sentences together,” Wolaver, who hails from Good Hope, said, according to&lt;em&gt; Daily Mail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Wolaver / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Amanda Wolaver says her health struggle began after getting injections to combat wrinkles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEOPLE has reached out to Abbievie, the manufacturer of Botox, and Galderma, the manufacturer of Dysport, for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CT scan showed “nothing to do with the injection,” but her condition worsened, she said. Strong smells bothered her; She got dizzy quickly and relied heavily on her husband, Josh, 39, to care for their three children: Landen, 16, Braxton, 11, and Havyn, 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn't be the mother I wanted for my three children,” said Wolaver, who struggled to walk, drive, and even move — leading her to think she was “slowly dying.” Doctors suspected multiple sclerosis or an autoimmune disorder. She had spinal taps and even a heart monitor implanted to diagnose the cause of her illness. It was only after she spent some time in an online forum that she learned what a possible source of her illness. After spending approximately $30,000 on tests, Wolaver learned she’d been having mini-strokes caused by iatrogenic &lt;a href="https://people.com/pesto-botulism-outbreak-6-people-sick-8710857" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:botulism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;botulism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iatrogenic means an illness that comes from a medical procedure. Botulism is a rare but serious illness that’s generally caused by food tainted by the toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. Botox is formulated from this same toxin, but as the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/botox/about/pac-20384658" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; says, is purified and meets medical control standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botulism can occur after Botox “when the toxin circulates in the blood and produces effects remotely from the injection site,” the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00507.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. Centers for Disease Control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; explained after a 2024 outbreak of botulism from Botox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Wolaver / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Amanda Wolaver says she thought she was "slowly dying" until she paid out-of-pocket for tests that said she had botulism.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of botulism may start within a few hours, and include trouble swallowing or speaking, nausea, trouble breathing, and blurred vision, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/prevention/home-canned-foods.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. “Recovery may take months and typically involves extended rehabilitation therapy,” the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/botulism/symptoms-causes/syc-20370262" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; says. While antitoxins may help, they “can't reverse damage that's already been done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding out she’d had botulism, she said, “knocked me back. To be told I had suffered from multiple small strokes in my brain made me think that this would eventually kill me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to speed her recovery along, she’s changed her diet and even had her implants removed, hoping it’ll detoxify her body.

        &lt;p class="nih-pretitle"&gt;Wednesday, July 30, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;Beta-HPV can directly cause skin cancer in immunocompromised people&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;NIH case study finds virus drives creation of cancer cells in context of defective T cells.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have shown for the first time that a type of human papillomavirus (HPV) commonly found on the skin can directly cause a form of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) when certain immune cells malfunction. cSCC is one of the most common cancers in the United States and worldwide. Previously, scientists believed HPV merely facilitated the accumulation of DNA mutations caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, usually the primary driver of cSCC. The findings were published today in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This discovery could completely change how we think about the development, and consequently the treatment, of cSCC in people who have a health condition that compromises immune function,” said Andrea Lisco, M.D., Ph.D., of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). “It suggests that there may be more people out there with aggressive forms of cSCC who have an underlying immune defect and could benefit from treatments targeting the immune system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of HPV, each tending to infect cells in a particular tissue and part of the body. The types of HPV found mostly on the skin—beta-HPV—are considered benign members of the skin &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Microbiome"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt; that typically do not integrate into the DNA of skin cells. This contrasts with the alpha types of HPV, known to integrate into the DNA of mucous membrane cells and directly cause cancer of the genitals, anus, head and neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIH researchers made their discovery in a 34-year-old woman who came to the NIH Clinical Center for evaluation and treatment of recurrent cSCC on her forehead. She had undergone multiple surgeries and a round of immunotherapy to try to remove or kill the tumor, but it repeatedly grew back. Her local doctors thought this was due to an inherited inability to repair DNA damaged by UV radiation plus an impairment in immune cells called T cells. The tumor was one of many progressively worsening HPV-related diseases the woman was experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a sophisticated genetic analysis, the NIH researchers discovered that a beta-HPV had integrated into the cellular DNA of the woman’s well-established tumor and was extensively producing viral proteins there&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;This contradicted the prevailing theory that beta-HPV only facilitates the establishment of cSCC without integrating into cellular DNA and plays no role in maintaining the cancer&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Further genetic analysis of the woman’s cells showed they were fully capable of repairing DNA damage from UV radiation, suggesting the virus alone had caused cSCC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how beta-HPV could take the unusual steps of integrating into the woman’s skin-cell DNA and multiplying there unchecked, the investigators studied the woman’s inherited immune disorder. They found that her genetic mutations greatly hampered T cells from activating in response to skin-cell infection by beta-HPV. This suggested that the immune disorder itself was responsible for the woman’s worsening HPV-related diseases, including the beta-HPV cSCC on her forehead, and that treating this disorder might cure all of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, NIH investigators developed a personalized plan to give the woman a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/stem-cell-transplant"&gt;stem cell transplant&lt;/a&gt; to replace her defective T cells with healthy ones. The process required extreme care because she was immunocompromised even before treatment began. The transplant proceeded without complications. Afterward, all her HPV-related diseases including the recurrent, aggressive cSCC resolved and have not recurred during the more than three years since the transplant. This confirms that the woman’s inherited disorder had prevented her T cells from keeping beta-HPV in check, allowing the virus to directly cause and sustain cSCC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This discovery and successful outcome would not have been possible without the combined expertise of virologists, immunologists, oncologists and transplant specialists, all working under the same roof of the &lt;a href="https://www.cc.nih.gov/"&gt;NIH Clinical Center&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, their finding suggests that other people with defective T-cell responses may also be susceptible to cancer caused directly by beta-HPV.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s long been thought to play a role in the development of skin cancer, but wasn’t believed to be a direct cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00deca" class="body-graf"&gt;Skin cancer is caused by DNA damage in skin cells. The most common source of that damage is ultraviolet radiation from the sun. HPV can help UV-damaged DNA build up in cells and turn cancerous. However, in the new case report, doctors found that the virus itself could cause cancerous lesions to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f7e615" class="body-graf"&gt;The discovery was made in a 34-year-old woman with a weakened immune system; experts said it’s highly unlikely that HPV could play the same role in causing skin cancer in a person with a healthy immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a009e9" class="body-graf"&gt;“The virus replicated in a somewhat uncontrolled manner and ended up integrating into the skin cells and once they did that, they became cancerous,” said Dr. Andrea Lisco, section chief of the  mucosal and cutaneous viral immunopathogenesis unit at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the NIH. Lisco was the woman’s doctor and also the senior author of the case report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acb1a6" class="body-graf"&gt;The woman had 43 spots of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma — the second-most common type of skin cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-groundbreaking-treatment-advanced-melanoma-rcna138005" target="_blank"&gt;after melanoma&lt;/a&gt; —  on her face, hands and legs. She had surgery to remove the cancers and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/jimmy-carter-drug-immunotherapy-melanoma-rcna153166" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, but the cancer returned. When Lisco and his team biopsied several of her new tumors, they found that the woman’s skin cancer was being driven by something they hadn’t seen before: a group of HPVs called beta HPV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f214c4" class="body-graf"&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2019.00355/full" target="_blank"&gt;90% of people&lt;/a&gt; carry a strain of beta HPV. Usually, the virus lives on the skin and doesn’t integrate into the DNA of skin cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1dcb85" class="body-graf"&gt;“We shake hands and we pick up those viruses, but if our immune systems are under control, we are fine,” Lisco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-45d028" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s a different group of HPV strains — alpha HPVs — that are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/hpv-can-cause-cancer-many-people-dont-realize-rcna79597" target="_blank"&gt;linked to a range of cancers&lt;/a&gt;. Alpha HPVs live on mucus membranes and can integrate into DNA, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-hpv-increasing-women-vaccine-safe-rcna196439" target="_blank"&gt;causing cancers of the cervix&lt;/a&gt;, anus, head and neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-325ff8" class="body-graf"&gt;The woman in the case report had a genetic condition that weakened her T-cells (a type of immune cell), leaving her immunocompromised. This allowed the beta HPV living on her skin to behave more like alpha HPV, integrating its DNA into her skin cells and replicating undisturbed, turning the cells cancerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-451f9c" class="body-graf"&gt;“You don’t know how much you can directly apply the information from one patient to the wide variety of patients,” said Dr. Anthony Oro, professor of dermatology at Stanford Medicine, who wasn’t involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-01cc80" class="body-graf"&gt;However, “it suggests that, in the event that the T-cell arm of the immune system is not doing its job, beta-type HPV viruses could contribute to skin cancer, and maybe other kinds of cancers as well,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8a450" class="body-graf"&gt;The patient needed a stem cell transplant, which replaced her defective T-cells with T-cells that could prevent the HPV from replicating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-853c5f" class="body-graf"&gt;“We needed to give this patient a whole new immune system,” Lisco said. It worked. Three years post-transplant, the woman’s skin cancer has not returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-976fd6" class="body-graf"&gt;“It gives us good information about how the interplay of the HPV and the immune system works,” said Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist and Mohs surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who also wasn’t involved with the woman’s case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ae22f" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors have known for a long time that some beta HPVs cause changes on the skin, such as warts on the hands and feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-638f59" class="body-graf"&gt;“HPV can integrate and cause changes in the cell cycle, especially in people with suppressed immune systems,” Rossi said. “What was novel about this is that they found out it was a beta HPV that integrated into the DNA.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_small__gIJ9M" id="anchor-f77068"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1800"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1240px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-360w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-360w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-320w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-320w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 758px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg" alt="Squamous cell carcinoma"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lip in a 50-year-old woman. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;BSIP / Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-69a14b" class="body-graf"&gt;Other researchers have speculated this was a possibility based on studies in mice, but the new report shows that it can occur in humans. How many people could be at risk is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-810d51" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is just one patient, and they have this unique situation of an immunological condition that enables the beta HPV to replicate unchecked,” Oro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-826dd5" class="body-graf"&gt;Other biopsies of squamous skin cancers have not detected HPV, meaning not all cases are  caused by the viruses. Lisco said that the original notion — that HPV passively contributes to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma by helping UV radiation damage skin cells, but doesn’t actively help cancer grow — is still the likely explanation for many people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-24b12c" class="body-graf"&gt;For them, “protection from UV would be the prevention,” Lisco said — wearing sunscreen and covering up your skin from the sun — adding that immunocompromised people should be monitored more closely. People with weakened immune systems are as much as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11430974/" target="_blank"&gt;100 times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop squamous cell carcinoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2f7cf" class="body-graf"&gt;The Gardasil HPV vaccine protects against nine strains of alpha HPV and has been shown to lower rates of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/hpv-vaccine-benefits-exceed-expectations-may-lead-elimination-cervical-cancer-n1022206" target="_blank"&gt;cervical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hpv-vaccine-linked-lower-rates-head-neck-cancer-males-study-finds-rcna153759" target="_blank"&gt;head and neck cancers&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear how much cross-protection, if any, the vaccine provides against other strains of HPV, including beta HPV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b35e8" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even if this strain is not in the vaccine, there is some theory that there is cross-talk between HPV strains,” Rossi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-49faf6" class="body-graf"&gt;Most people will get HPV in their lifetimes. Scientists have so far identified about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-11-human-papillomavirus.html#:~:text=licensed%20in%202014.-,Human%20Papillomavirus%20(HPV),about%2066%25%20of%20cervical%20cancers." target="_blank"&gt;200 unique&lt;/a&gt; strains of the virus. Alpha-HPV, with its well-established links to cancer, has thus far been the primary subject of research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-09a975" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This suggests that this other side of the family might also be important in situations where our immune system is not doing its job,” Oro said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 21:01:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQRjN5SzhHMDdvTkFBSHloektKbTNaTFFPbFowalBqS1JsUUtJeDZzak5sX3ZLT0pHT2p4cHFlZEtDV3RnMXpqN2RWSXVhWGN5UE9lVDM5YmsxR2pKYjlCMEUwSXFoOEtjT0ttVWE2ZmNGWjNwbnNWTk1NVjRmcE5xNEdNVWp2QlRNLW42MHhFSjJpYmRjR1E0bXhlSC3SAVZBVV95cUxPaGdDVHNndjhsTmFDUHNZSmJYeHRPT1hLTUlDaWM0NVlHOTVYT0JxVXVGWkNUZEFUbzZBbXFKeVRVNk13SFM1dVRhSGR2NDlXYmxtNVd3UQ</guid></item><item><title>加拿大麻疹病例超过美国，艾伯塔省官员推动紧急状态-纽约时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxNRUhJR0ZyazFucDlhampmZEpBNmpOVlpFOVFlYW42TTJiY1JRU3U4VVNhQ211UVZuZEsxMFFhQW81MTctU1lfdUZIU01wcElzbWxqZUN0SUM0OTV3MHlzaTBha200ejV3bEtPTjdDVnhKUjFrMERJd3NfQnByc3NES2F6RzdWa0hjWUpJWA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 20:25:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNRUhJR0ZyazFucDlhampmZEpBNmpOVlpFOVFlYW42TTJiY1JRU3U4VVNhQ211UVZuZEsxMFFhQW81MTctU1lfdUZIU01wcElzbWxqZUN0SUM0OTV3MHlzaTBha200ejV3bEtPTjdDVnhKUjFrMERJd3NfQnByc3NES2F6RzdWa0hjWUpJWA</guid></item><item><title>3年以上未确诊的痴呆症-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE1JVFNZMkxvTkVVTGNGeW9FS2lsWTBPUHJ0VElmbXRKb0pzamdGMTVEakk2Nm1LbDFzVmplQnozMWJOWWZCTUpwQ3drcVhRd3oyYk9MOUI4bzk1Um05TVRtSlNwUWdGaFdyVlhRTw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How long does it typically take to diagnose dementia?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: On average, 3.5 years from first symptom recognition—4.1 years for early-onset cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What factors delay diagnosis?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: Younger age, frontotemporal dementia, systemic healthcare issues, and stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does timely diagnosis matter?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: Early diagnosis improves access to treatments and prolongs quality of life during early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A global analysis has revealed that people with dementia wait an average of 3.5 years after symptom onset before receiving a diagnosis. The delay is even longer—about 4.1 years—for early-onset dementia, with younger patients and those with frontotemporal dementia facing the greatest lags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors include misinterpreting symptoms as normal aging, limited access to specialists, stigma, and healthcare system bottlenecks. Researchers call for urgent reforms to improve clinician training, public awareness, and diagnostic infrastructure worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Delays:&lt;/strong&gt; Dementia diagnosis takes an average of 3.5 years after symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Younger Patients at Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Early-onset and younger individuals face longer delays, averaging 4.1 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barriers to Diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; Stigma, lack of awareness, specialist shortages, and systemic issues all contribute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with dementia are diagnosed an average of 3.5 years after symptoms are first noticed, or even longer (4.1 years) for those with early-onset dementia, finds a new study led by UCL researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of global evidence examining time to diagnosis in dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112029"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman looking through a photo album with her caregiver." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/dementia-diagnosis-wait-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They found that younger age at onset and having frontotemporal dementia were both linked to longer time to diagnosis. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reviewed data from 13 previously published studies which took place in Europe, US, Australia and China, reporting data on 30,257 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team was investigating the average interval between symptom onset (rated by patients or family carers using interviews or medical records) to the final diagnosis of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Vasiliki Orgeta (UCL Division of Psychiatry) said: “Timely diagnosis of dementia remains a major global challenge, shaped by a complex set of factors, and specific healthcare strategies are urgently needed to improve it. Other studies estimate that only 50-65% of cases are ever diagnosed in high-income countries, with many countries having even lower diagnostic rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Timely diagnosis can improve access to treatments and for some people prolong the time living with mild dementia before symptoms worsen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a pooled meta-analysis of 10 of the included studies, the researchers found that it typically takes 3.5 years from the first alert of symptoms to a patient receiving a diagnosis of dementia, or 4.1 years for those with early-onset dementia, with some groups more likely to experience longer delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that younger age at onset and having frontotemporal dementia were both linked to longer time to diagnosis. While data on racial disparities was limited, one of the studies reviewed found that black patients tended to experience a longer delay before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Orgeta said: “Our work highlights the need for a clear conceptual framework on time to diagnosis in dementia, developed in collaboration with people with dementia, their carers, and supporters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Phuong Leung (UCL Division of Psychiatry) said: “Symptoms of dementia are often mistaken for normal ageing, while fear, stigma, and low public awareness can discourage people from seeking help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Rafael Del-Pino-Casado, of the University of Jaén, Spain, said: “Within healthcare systems, inconsistent referral pathways, limited access to specialists, and under-resourced memory clinics can create further delays. For some, language differences or a lack of culturally appropriate assessment tools can make access to timely diagnosis even harder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Orgeta added: “To speed up dementia diagnosis, we need action on multiple fronts. Public awareness campaigns can help improve understanding of early symptoms and reduce stigma, encouraging people to seek help sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clinician training is critical to improve early recognition and referral, along with access to early intervention and individualised support so that people with dementia and their families can get the help they need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#107d3e776275716675635065737c3e71733e657b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mark Greaves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mark Greaves – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.70129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Time to Diagnosis in Dementia: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Vasiliki Orgeta et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to Diagnosis in Dementia: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timely dementia diagnosis is a global priority, reflected in most national and regional policies and plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there are currently no robust estimates of the average time to diagnosis (TTD) and factors influencing diagnostic intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article presents the first systematic review of quantitative studies on TTD in dementia and the factors associated with its duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We systematically searched EMBASE, Psych INFO, MEDLINE, and CINAHL databases for relevant studies published up to December 2024. We defined TTD as the interval between symptom onset (rated by family carers or patients using interviews or medical records) to final diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of bias was assessed using the Reporting studies on time to diagnosis tool. We included 13 studies reporting data on 30,257 participants, with age at onset ranging between 54 and 93 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta-analysis pooling 10 studies showed that average mean TTD across all types of dementia was 3.5 years [confidence interval (CI): 2.7–4.3; moderate quality evidence].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyses of six studies showed that TTD in young onset dementia was 4.1 years (CI: 3.4–4.9; moderate quality evidence). Although the factors influencing TTD were inconsistent, a younger age at onset and having frontotemporal dementia were consistently associated with a longer interval to diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TTD in dementia remains long, and specific healthcare strategies are urgently needed to improve it. Increasing the evidence base and developing interventions to reduce TTD should be a future research priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist services are likely to be key in improving TTD in young-onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 20:16:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1JVFNZMkxvTkVVTGNGeW9FS2lsWTBPUHJ0VElmbXRKb0pzamdGMTVEakk2Nm1LbDFzVmplQnozMWJOWWZCTUpwQ3drcVhRd3oyYk9MOUI4bzk1Um05TVRtSlNwUWdGaFdyVlhRTw</guid></item><item><title>在马萨诸塞州东南部城镇的蚊子中发现的潜在致命的EEE病毒。-波士顿25新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNa0VwUV9VRFdEQkZMa3JybGhIX3dwY3pVdGRUMzE2V3RtNllaQzFfUnYxQUplVHpDMWdoLURIU0hZNkxyQ1ZpQ2dBaHNBX2xfSnNEWncwMUZkU0p3MEZfYm45T3c5NDJaSmc4MkZUZnNUUS1ueUZhbndUNDJmZHlycnh5R1ozbUU0cW9oVWltSW1YeS03bmtDd2Z5cEpSRmNIV2JhSFhrb2xQaHFYVlI4eFdWMmxoaTdM0gHMAUFVX3lxTFAzREZaazBtWExBMllFa2VuRlVzdVRjdnJrcFlmbXdaWFFWSnFZN3psd1drRXRwV2hGNU5fSGpSQlh2TXNkeXRSSTNvSnZaZHhoYWEtR0FIcHRoMkF3SEdKZEdLRGpoUXhIbjZ5dFEzcUNjUmlsMS0wWExuTkZFSmdJUmxmam1QbXN4NUI1RGhuUm55MlBVWDB3RmlsRkdHcTU0VklQN0t4NXhwYlBSUDlGQVpGYV9VMXh5NTRqSzQxZGpBbUxSYVB1cmZGVw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="default__ArticleBody-sc-tl066j-1 jPcFTl article-body-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;BRIDGEWATER, Mass. — The Eastern equine encephalitis virus has been detected in mosquitoes in Bridgewater, town officials said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;The news out of Bridgewater comes one week after state officials announced &lt;a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/eee-virus-detected-mosquitoes-mass-first-time-this-year/6BKEJCPKYZER5IY4QNRNQIFV3Y/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/eee-virus-detected-mosquitoes-mass-first-time-this-year/6BKEJCPKYZER5IY4QNRNQIFV3Y/"&gt;EEE was detected in mosquitoes in Massachusetts for the first time this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;State public health officials notified Bridgewater town officials that a mosquito collected on July 22 tested positive for EEE, Town Manager Justin Casanova-Davis said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;No human or animal cases of EEE have been detected in Massachusetts so far this year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more" class="taboola-read-more"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Bridgewater and most of southeastern Massachusetts are currently classified by the state as low risk for EEE and West Nile Virus, Casanova-Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="redesign-embedded-container"&gt;&lt;div class="redesign-embedded-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="embedded-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="ImageMetadata__MetadataParagraph-sc-1htor29-0 jibCgM image-metadata"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mosquitoes carrying deadly EEE virus &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Town officials are working closely with state public health officials to monitor the situation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;EEE is a rare but serious and potentially fatal disease that can affect people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;EEE is generally spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.

Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening, after 6 p.m. or early morning. Otherwise, take extra care to use repellent and protective clothing. Mosquitoes can be active during daylight hours when the temperatures are cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clothing can help reduce mosquito bites.&lt;/b&gt; Although it may be difficult to do when it is hot, wearing long sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Apply insect repellent when you go outdoors&lt;/b&gt;. Use a repellent with DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023) or oil of lemon eucalyptus [p-methane 3, 8-diol (PMD)] according to the instructions on the product label. DEET products should not be used on infants younger than 2 months of age and should be used in concentrations of 30 percent or less on older children. Oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children younger than 3 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mosquito-proof your Home and drain standing water.&lt;/b&gt; Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by either draining or getting rid of items that hold water. Check rain gutters and drains. Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools, and change water in birdbaths frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install or repair screens.&lt;/b&gt; Some mosquitoes like to come indoors. Keep them outside by having tightly fitted screens on all windows and doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protect your animals. &lt;/b&gt;Animal owners should reduce potential mosquito breeding sites on their property by eliminating standing water from containers such as buckets, tires, and wading pools – especially after heavy rains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Water troughs provide excellent mosquito breeding habitats and should be flushed out at least once a week during the summer months to reduce mosquitoes near paddock areas. Horse owners should keep horses in indoor stalls at night to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes. Owners should also speak with their veterinarian about mosquito repellents approved for use in animals and vaccinations to prevent WNV and EEE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;If an animal is suspected of having West Nile Virus or EEE, owners are required to report to the Department of Agricultural Resources, Division of Animal Health by calling 617-626-1795, and to the Department of Public Health by calling 617- 983-6800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;More information, including all West Nile Virus- and EEE-positive results can be found at this &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/mosquito-borne-disease-prevention" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/mosquito-borne-disease-prevention"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; or by calling the DPH Division of Epidemiology at 617-983-6800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study reveals that fragmented sleep causes cellular damage to the brain's blood vessels, providing further evidence to suggest that sleep disruption predisposes the brain to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awaf161/8189044?login=true" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Brain&lt;/i&gt;, is the first to offer cellular and molecular evidence that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sleep+disruption/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sleep disruption&lt;/a&gt; directly causes damage to brain &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; and blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that individuals who had more fragmented sleep, such as sleeping restlessly and waking up a lot at night, had a change in their balance of pericytes—a brain blood vessel cell that plays an important role in regulating brain blood flow and the entry and exit of substances between the blood and the brain," said Andrew Lim, principal investigator of the study and a sleep neurologist and scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This in turn was associated with a more rapid decline in cognitive function in the decade leading up to their death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers applied wearable smartwatch-like sensors to the research subjects—more than 600 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;—to measure their sleep and used new gene sequencing technologies to measure levels of pericytes in the brain. The research participants subsequently passed away and donated their brains for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that in some individuals, sleep disruption can precede the onset of cognitive impairment by years, with emerging evidence suggesting a bidirectional link between sleep disruption and Alzheimer's disease," adds Lim, who is also an associate professor in the department of medicine in the University of Toronto's Temerty Faculty of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"However, we didn't have sufficient evidence behind the mechanisms underlying these links, until now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study's findings suggest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep fragmentation may be an important factor leading to brain blood vessel injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pericytes may be particularly important in mediating these effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting sleep fragmentation may be a means of improving brain vascular health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting pericytes may be a mechanism of preventing the deleterious effects of sleep fragmentation on brain &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+flow/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This study raises the possibility that changes in pericytes may be a mechanism linking sleep fragmentation with small vessel disease and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;," says Lim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If confirmed in clinical trials of sleep interventions with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pericyte/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pericyte&lt;/a&gt; biomarker outcomes, Lim adds, "it would highlight that sleep interventions may be an effective means to alter human small vessel biology and cognitive decline, and also raise the possibility that aggressive treatment of other risk factors for cerebral small vessel disease may help prevent the deleterious impact of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sleep+fragmentation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sleep fragmentation&lt;/a&gt; on small vessel biology."&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human
Services announced Wednesday North Carolina’s first reported case of West Nile
virus in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Officials said the case was found in a Durham County
resident. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Officials have not released the name of the person who
tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;/a&gt; the
West Nile virus is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the
continental United States. The virus is commonly spread to people by the bite
of an infected mosquito. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The CDC said there is no vaccine to prevent or
medicines to treat West Nile in people. The best way to&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/prevention/index.html"&gt; reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt; is to protect
yourself from mosquito bites. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·        
Use insect repellent &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·        
Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants &lt;/p&gt;

Individuals with long COVID were significantly more likely to report DGBIs, along with worsened anxiety, depression, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is this study important?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: It is the first direct, population-level comparison of gut-brain disorder rates before and after the pandemic using consistent diagnostic methods, shedding light on COVID-19’s long-term impact on digestive and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A major international study confirms that disorders of gut-brain interaction have increased significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic. Using consistent diagnostic tools across 2017 and 2023 populations, researchers found notable surges in IBS and functional dyspepsia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those suffering from long COVID were especially vulnerable, with more severe gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms. The findings underscore an urgent need for improved care strategies addressing the gut-brain connection in a post-COVID world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Pandemic Surge:&lt;/strong&gt; DGBIs rose from 38.3% to 42.6% since 2017.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IBS &amp;amp; Dyspepsia Climb:&lt;/strong&gt; IBS increased by 28%; functional dyspepsia by nearly 44%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long COVID Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients with long COVID show significantly higher rates and severity of DGBIs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American Gastroenterological Association&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new international study confirmed a significant post-pandemic rise in disorders of gut-brain interaction, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia, according to the paper published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on prior research, investigators used Rome Foundation diagnostic tools to analyze nationally representative samples from both 2017 and 2023 — offering the first direct, population-level comparison of disorders of gut-brain interaction prevalence before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overall disorders of gut-brain interaction rose from 38.3% to 42.6%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IBS jumped 28%, from 4.7% to 6%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functional dyspepsia rose by nearly 44%, from 8.3% to 11.9%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals with long COVID were significantly more likely to have a disorder of gut-brain interaction and reported worse anxiety, depression, and quality of life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first population-level study to directly compare rates of disorders affecting gut-brain interaction before and after the pandemic, using a consistent methodology. It adds weight to growing calls for updated care models and more research into the gut-brain axis in the post-COVID era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this COVID-19 and gut-brain axis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f998949c9195b99e988a8d8b96d7968b9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annie Mehl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://gastro.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Gastroenterological Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Annie Mehl – American Gastroenterological Association&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/74/Suppl_1/A19.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Prevalence and Burden of Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction (DGBI) before versus after the COVID-19 Pandemic&lt;/a&gt;” by Imran AZIZ et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prevalence and Burden of Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction (DGBI) before versus after the COVID-19 Pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background &amp;amp; Aims&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-1"&gt;COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of developing Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction (DGBI). However, the extent of this effect on a population level, and how directly it is related to COVID-19 illness, is poorly understood. We performed a two-country survey to address this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;A population-based Internet survey with pre-defined demographic quotas was conducted across the UK and USA in 2017 (pre-pandemic, n=4050) and repeated in 2023 (post-pandemic, n=4002). The surveys included the Rome IV diagnostic questionnaire, and questions about non-gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, anxiety and depression, quality of life, and healthcare utilization. The 2023 survey also included questions regarding COVID-19 infection and illness history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;The overall DGBI prevalence, i.e., meeting diagnostic criteria for at least one DGBI, has significantly increased from the pre- to post- pandemic era (38.3% vs. 42.6%, OR 1.20, 95% C.I 1.09-1.31), with similar findings independently noted in the UK and USA. The rise in DGBI was observed within the esophageal (8.8% vs. 10.1%, OR 1.16), gastroduodenal (11.9% vs. 16.4%, OR 1.45), and bowel domains (30.1% vs. 32.5%, OR 1.12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;The two most widely investigated DGBI showed large post-pandemic prevalence increases, with functional dyspepsia rising from 8.3% to 11.9% (OR 1.48) and irritable bowel syndrome from 4.7% to 6.0% (OR 1.31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;Individuals with DGBI in the post-pandemic era, in particular those with long-COVID, reported reduced quality of life and higher mood disturbances, somatic symptom reporting and healthcare use than individuals with DGBI in the pre-pandemic era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-4"&gt;In multivariable analysis, COVID-related factors associated with having DGBI in the post-pandemic era included increasing number of COVID-19 infections (OR 1.31), experiencing abdominal pain (OR 2.06) or diarrhea (OR 1.33) during COVID-19 infection, suffering with long-COVID (OR 1.65), and not being vaccinated (OR 1.35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-5"&gt;The population prevalence and burden of DGBI have increased following the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare services and research funding bodies need to adapt to this post-COVID surge in DGBI and address how to best manage this patient group.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 19:25:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTFBnNmRGQ3IzNFB0Xy1WZzlFMjV1ZEdDdUZtU1dYSFFGOGZPNzNhMDhQMTBTLXdNX2hzMkZNd1hqT2oyODB0bGgwMWplVU81UHNxVE91cnpuOTJFdXdhRlBGdG1iUlJkdw</guid></item><item><title>44岁的妈妈揭示了她解雇的1个宫颈癌标志- TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQdFpnbEY1VWEwSUt1WHEtdTV6bVU3U2hJU2xPR1ZTVkRxZ3lVQ1hENVRkMUtXOEZCandLc1Q2MlB0S2VZbENoX0lELVgyT3N4UmVQWmdrVmRRX0RLVWxFVlMwLW9WUHNxWXhTMk9tNHVHVjJrTlRqdDBmN3ZYZWdldVZyd21hbjZjVl9NU2xLcjl0ZnM10gFUQVVfeXFMUHpPSTZoMWk2SkN6RkNLbEEzZ2taMXRmUDFzLUtJT3Bmdjd1RHhnVTZwNkFZQ1pNZVhkTE8yNVpGV0tIRXFSZWtJNFFQc0FCOE9sajUw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54549f" class="body-graf"&gt;In early 2024, Melissa Sanders experienced an almost three-month long period.

But she faced an unexpected complication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e65b91" class="body-graf"&gt;“They stopped my biopsy within two minutes of starting it,” she says. “I had cancerous skin falling off my cervix, just falling off, and there was ooze.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a7c20" class="body-graf"&gt;The doctor could tell Sanders had a mass by feeling it, and an MRI and PET scan revealed that she had Stage 3 cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f7b3d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors recommended chemotherapy and radiation to treat it. For about six months, she underwent treatment. Undergoing grueling therapies took a toll on her health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d33d2" class="body-graf"&gt;“My son pretty much had to carry (me) around at my last radiation,” Sanders says. “I was really, really weak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff7b71" class="body-graf"&gt;In September 2024, she finished treatment. While she gradually feels better, Sanders still notices she struggles with weakness and ongoing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2bae2d" class="body-graf"&gt;“I can’t stand … as long as I was able to before,” she says. “My legs are weak, my hips. That’s just from my waist down. It’s like I've got to gain all my muscles back.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9fa96e" class="body-graf"&gt;She’s in physical therapy to try to improve her strength. Every three months, she has bloodwork done, and she undergoes scans to make sure she’s still cancer free. Since last year, her scans have been clear. While she did not undergo any surgery, her cancer treatments have put her in menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd7157" class="body-graf"&gt;“My doctor said I won’t have a period for the rest of my life,” she says. “I will have hot flashes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-50651f" class="body-heading"&gt;Cervical Cancer &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-04e6ba" class="body-graf"&gt;Cervical cancer is usually caused by an infection with the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/martina-navratilovas-hpv-turned-cancer-happen-rcna64433" target="_blank"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; (HPV), which infects about 80% of people at some point in their lives, &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/prevention-screening/manage-your-risk/hpv.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to MD Anderson Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;. While many people clear the virus from their system, some are not able to, and the virus lingers. About 12 types of HPV are considered high risk and can lead to cervical cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-36a782" class="body-graf"&gt;“One of my colleagues called it the common cold for the vagina,” Dr. Sudha Amarnath, a radiology oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-dd1c7a"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1944"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-04-a1583a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-04-a1583a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-04-a1583a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-04-a1583a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-04-a1583a.jpg" alt="Melissa Sanders works as a flagger and felt that she had a difficult time standing because of the pain she experienced from cervical cancer."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Melissa Sanders works as a flagger and felt that she had a difficult time standing because of the pain she experienced from cervical cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Melissa Sanders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fa1f6" class="body-graf"&gt;While Pap smears and HPV screening can often detect precancerous cells or high-risk HPV infections, many women, like Sanders, do not realize they need to undergo regular screening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a3a1e8" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is something that we see really frequently. A lot of women stop taking care of themselves once they stop having children because they’re so focused on their kids and other people in their lives,” Amarnath says. “We’ve all been exposed to HPV, and so making sure that it’s not causing any precancerous and cancer changes … in our cervix is really important.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90b541" class="body-graf"&gt;A Pap smear — where doctors take a sample of cervical cells from outside and inside the cervix — is one of the best ways to screen for cervical cancer. They are recommended every three years between the ages of 21-65, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/screening" target="_blank"&gt;per the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d37c2a" class="body-graf"&gt;“The goal is to find any changes in those cells ... so you can remove them before they turn into cancer,” Amarnath says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ec871" class="body-graf"&gt;Signs of cervical cancer include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b56f1" class="body-graf"&gt;For early-stage cervical cancer, doctors can sometimes remove the affected part of the cervix. But if the tumor is too big or located too deep within the body, doctors might use chemotherapy and radiation instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6016ee" class="body-graf"&gt;The good news about cervical cancer is that it can be avoided. &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/cancer-vaccine-hpv-rcna195393" target="_blank"&gt;The HPV vaccine is 97% effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing HPV-related cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-316d6f" class="body-graf"&gt;“We’d like to scream it from a rooftop — everyone should get the HPV vaccine,” Amarnath says. “It protects against several … strains of high-risk HPV, so it can protect against cervical cancer, vaginal cancer, anal cancer, head and neck cancers for both boys and girls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3f4c36" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Don't Ignore It’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ef00d1" class="body-graf"&gt;When Sanders started treatment for cervical cancer, she had to stop watching her granddaughter, Gracelynn, because Gracelynn’s mom wanted Sanders to have enough time to rest and recover. Not seeing her granddaughter felt tough because it dramatically changed Sanders' daily schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a83c6b" class="body-graf"&gt;“She was with me every day,” she says. “I had her all the time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1ca77e" class="body-graf"&gt;During her treatment, Sanders spent a month away from home. Being away from her family and grappling with a cancer diagnosis felt isolating and depressing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2ec2c" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was sad,” she says. “I wanted everything to be normal.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33daf8" class="body-graf"&gt;Since treatment, Sanders started prioritizing her health so she can see Gracelynn grow up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-073868" class="body-graf"&gt;“I got to put me first,” she says. “I try to do everything healthier. I just walked 3 miles the other day with my daughter and grandbaby.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-388ee1" class="body-graf"&gt;Sanders says she hopes that others learn from her experience and do not neglect their cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-849f7b" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“A lot of people have that mindset that life is too busy. But it really isn’t,” she says. “It’s very important to keep up with your Pap smears, mammograms. Don’t ignore it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 19:18:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQdFpnbEY1VWEwSUt1WHEtdTV6bVU3U2hJU2xPR1ZTVkRxZ3lVQ1hENVRkMUtXOEZCandLc1Q2MlB0S2VZbENoX0lELVgyT3N4UmVQWmdrVmRRX0RLVWxFVlMwLW9WUHNxWXhTMk9tNHVHVjJrTlRqdDBmN3ZYZWdldVZyd21hbjZjVl9NU2xLcjl0ZnM10gFUQVVfeXFMUHpPSTZoMWk2SkN6RkNLbEEzZ2taMXRmUDFzLUtJT3Bmdjd1RHhnVTZwNkFZQ1pNZVhkTE8yNVpGV0tIRXFSZWtJNFFQc0FCOE9sajUw</guid></item><item><title>科学家用孔雀羽毛制造该死的激光束- Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxQMHhzVk1xTF9TN1lFM014Zk1NTTZpdWZ6U3d0cjNnUmM0TmNfeTJaOGxiaS1OLVJKWUJkSHdnWk4wa1Y3MUV4bWk1aG9Bb2g5ZVlTWVdUSTg4aW9vdVJXTjhiQUlyZ01nWDNBcnFCa3hxZS1NWDV0V2RpYjBNU25CWXA3LS15RWhoajFrX3ZWczZyT2dNWC0tLXdGd0hHdXl1Vnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Peacock feathers are greatly admired for their bright iridescent colors, but it turns out they can also emit laser light when dyed multiple times, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-04039-8"&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Scientific Reports. Per the authors, it's the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/peacock-feathers-can-be-lasers"&gt;first example&lt;/a&gt; of a biolaser cavity within the animal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/rainbow-weevil-could-hold-the-secret-to-generating-natures-colors-in-the-lab/"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, the bright iridescent colors in things like peacock feathers and butterfly wings don't come from any pigment molecules but from how they are structured. The scales of chitin (a polysaccharide common to insects) in butterfly wings, for example, are arranged like roof tiles. Essentially, they form a &lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5783709/the-colorful-story-of-diffraction-grating"&gt;diffraction grating&lt;/a&gt;, except photonic crystals only produce certain colors, or wavelengths, of light, while a diffraction grating will produce the entire spectrum, much like a prism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of peacock feathers, it's the regular, periodic nanostructures of the &lt;a class="mw-redirect" title="Barbule" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbule"&gt;barbules&lt;/a&gt;—fiber-like components composed of ordered melanin rods coated in keratin—that produce the iridescent colors. Different colors correspond to different spacing of the barbules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are naturally occurring examples of what physicists call &lt;a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/shiny-things-an-ode-to-photonic-crystals/"&gt;photonic crystals&lt;/a&gt;. Also known as photonic bandgap materials, photonic crystals are "tunable," which means they are precisely ordered in such a way as to block certain wavelengths of light while letting others through. Alter the structure by changing the size of the tiles, and the crystals become sensitive to a different wavelength. (In fact, the rainbow weevil &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/rainbow-weevil-could-hold-the-secret-to-generating-natures-colors-in-the-lab/"&gt;can control&lt;/a&gt; both the size of its scales and how much chitin is used to fine-tune those colors as needed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better (from an applications standpoint), the perception of color doesn't depend on the viewing angle. And the scales are not just for aesthetics; they help shield the insect from the elements. There are several types of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19547304"&gt;manmade photonic crystals&lt;/a&gt;, but gaining a better and more detailed understanding of how these structures grow in nature could help scientists design new materials with similar qualities, such as iridescent windows, self-cleaning surfaces for cars and buildings, or even waterproof textiles. Paper currency could incorporate encrypted iridescent patterns to foil counterfeiters.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, humans can inhale more than 70,000 microplastic particles each day in an indoor environment – far more than previously thought. Worse still, most of them are small enough to penetrate &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-just-how-far-plastic-can-reach-into-your-lungs"&gt;deep into our lungs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/7000-microplastics-studies-show-we-have-one-really-big-problem"&gt;defining environmental issues&lt;/a&gt; of our time, clogging up everything from our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tiny-crustaceans-fragment-insidious-microplastics-into-even-smaller-nanoplastics"&gt;waterways&lt;/a&gt; to our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-can-block-blood-flow-in-the-brain-study-in-mice-shows"&gt;bloodstreams&lt;/a&gt;. Tiny particles of the stuff enter our bodies not just through what we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-food-packaging-is-shedding-microplastics-into-every-meal-study-reveals"&gt;eat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-persist-in-drinking-water-despite-treatment-plant-advances"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt; but through the very &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-are-now-spiralling-around-the-globe-in-the-air-we-breathe"&gt;air we breathe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-inhale-a-credit-card-of-plastic-every-week-heres-where-it-goes?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;You Inhale a Credit Card of Plastic Every Week. Here's Where It Goes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, scientists from the Université de Toulouse in France quantified just how much plastic dust we may be inhaling every day. The team took 16 indoor air samples from their own apartments and cars, then analyzed them using a technique called Raman spectroscopy to measure the concentration of microplastics floating around in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169420" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169420" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2-642x355.jpg" alt="Humans Breathe in More Than 70,000 Microplastic Particles Every Day, New Study Suggests" class="wp-image-169420 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2-642x355.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2-750x415.jpg 750w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2-768x425.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2-600x332.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2.jpg 1095w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169420" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers calculated how many microplastic particles of different sizes humans inhale each day while in an indoor environment.

The median concentration for apartment air samples were 528 microplastic particles per cubic meter, and a whopping 2,238 particles per cubic meter in cars. Of those particles, 94 percent were less than 10 micrometers wide, which is small enough to work their way deep into lung tissue when inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this and other research, the team estimated that adults inhale roughly 71,000 microplastic particles from these environments every single day, with 68,000 of them being sub-10 micrometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The concentration we found is 100-fold higher than previous extrapolated estimates," the &lt;a href="http://plos.io/4m2xRFM"&gt;authors say&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People spend an average of 90 percent of their time indoors, including homes, workplaces, shops, transportation, etc., and all the while they are exposed to microplastic pollution through inhalation without even thinking about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly what those microplastics get up to once they're in our bodies remains uncertain, but scientists suspect it's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-expert-explains-the-real-dangers-of-microplastics-to-human-health"&gt;nothing good&lt;/a&gt;.

              &lt;p&gt;There really might be something to the idea of summertime sadness, at least for boys. A study finds that men born in the summer are more vulnerable to developing depression than men born at other times of the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Kwantlen Polytechnic University in British Columbia, Canada, conducted the study, an international survey of adults. They found that men, but not women, were more likely to experience depression symptoms later in life if their birth occurred in the summer compared to other seasons. The findings suggest that mothers are exposed to important environmental risk factors that vary throughout the calendar year, the authors say, including levels of sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study author Mika Mokkonen was inspired to look into this topic by the kind of question you’d get making small talk at a party.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The initial spark of the idea for this research arose when someone asked me if I believed in horoscopes. It got me wondering if there could potentially be a biological basis for them, in terms of how a person’s birthday could be associated with physiological or mental features,” he told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long known that seasonality can affect our current mental health—the clearest example being &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder"&gt;seasonal affective disorder&lt;/a&gt;, a type of depression that typically emerges during the winter months (summer SAD does exist, though). But there’s only been limited research looking at a possible link between birth timing and mental health, according to Mokkonen.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Mokkonen and his team conducted an online survey of 303 adults. Participants provided basic demographic information like age and answered two questionnaires commonly used to assess a person’s level of anxiety and depression. After controlling for factors like age and income, the researchers found that summer-born men (specifically people whose biological sex was male) were noticeably more likely to report depression symptoms than men born anytime else. The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmen.0000296"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in the journal PLOS Mental Health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These sorts of studies can only show a correlation between any two things (seasonality at birth and depression in this case) and not decidedly prove that being born in the summer can shape men’s mental health. The researchers also admit they only collected survey responses over a brief two-month period in early 2024, meaning they might not have been able to capture people’s “variations in depression and anxiety scores.” And while some of the participants did come from different countries, a substantial proportion were college students. It’s fair to say this is far from a thorough or complete study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So clearly more research is needed to replicate and expand on this preliminary finding. There’s also the unanswered and likely complex question of why being born in the summer could be specifically worse for men but not women.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Seasonality has long played a role in affecting the survival of most species, Mokkonen noted. And while people today are generally more sheltered from the harshest elements of the outside world than our hunter-gatherer ancestors were, the changing aspects of the seasons might still be enough to subtly influence us as we’re developing in the womb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I would say it is possibly related to the environmental conditions of the mother during pregnancy,” Mokkonen said. “Consider conditions like temperature and sunlight—how do those conditions vary across the year?”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to continue investigating how other maternal factors, including the mother’s diet and circulating hormone levels, can affect the later health of their children. Mokkonen also points out that regardless of the season they were born in, a majority of the people in their study reported having at least some symptoms of anxiety (66%) and depression (84%). In other words, while the seasons may hold some sway over us, some things are unfortunately common across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New measurements of fine microplastic particles suspended in the air in homes and cars suggest that humans may be inhaling far greater amounts of lung-penetrating microplastics than previously thought. Nadiia Yakovenko and colleagues at the Université de Toulouse, France, present these findings in the open-access journal &lt;a href="http://plos.io/44QxPdr" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS One&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Prior research has detected tiny fragments of plastic known as microplastics suspended in the air across a wide variety of outdoor and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/indoor+environments/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;indoor environments&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. The ubiquity of these airborne pollutants has raised concerns about their potential health effects, as small-sized inhaled &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/microplastic/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;microplastic&lt;/a&gt; particles may penetrate the lungs and could pose risks of oxidative stress, immune-system effects, and organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, prior research on airborne microplastics has mostly focused on larger particles ranging from 20 to 200 micrometers in diameter, which are less likely to penetrate the lungs than particles of 10 micrometers across or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help improve understanding of the risk of microplastic inhalation, Yakovenko and colleagues collected air samples from their own apartments, as well as from their own cars in realistic driving conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A technique called Raman spectroscopy enabled them to measure concentrations of microplastics, including those from 1 to 10 micrometers across, in 16 air samples.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that the median concentration of detected microplastics in the apartment air samples was 528 particles per cubic meter, and in the cars, 2,238 particles per cubic meter; 94% of the detected particles were smaller than 10 micrometers. (While car levels were higher than apartment levels, the difference was not statistically significant because of high variability of microplastic concentration in both environments.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The researchers then combined their results with previously published data on exposure to indoor microplastics, estimating that adults inhale about 3,200 microplastic particles per day in the range of 10 to 300 micrometers across, and 68,000 particles of 1 to 10 micrometers per day—100 times more than prior estimates for small-diameter exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/health+risks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health risks&lt;/a&gt; due to inhalation of lung-penetrating microplastics may be higher than previously thought. Further research will be needed to confirm and expand on these results.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors add, "We found that over 90% of the microplastic particles in indoor air across both homes and cars were smaller than 10 µm, small enough to be inhaled deep into the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was also the first study to measure microplastics in the car cabin environment, and overall, we detected indoor concentrations up to 100 times higher than previous extrapolated estimates, revealing indoor air as a major and previously underestimated exposure route of fine particulate microplastic inhalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everywhere we look, we find microplastics, even in the air we breathe inside our homes and cars. The biggest concern is how small these particles are completely invisible to the naked eye. We inhale thousands of them every day without even realizing it. Deep inside our lungs, microplastics release toxic additives that reach our blood and cause multiple diseases."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although metformin has been the go-to medication to manage type 2 diabetes for more than 60 years, researchers still do not have a complete picture of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Baylor College of Medicine and international collaborators have discovered a previously unrecognized new player mediating the clinically relevant effects of metformin: the brain. By uncovering a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+pathway/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain pathway&lt;/a&gt; involved in metformin's anti-diabetic action, researchers have discovered new possibilities for treating diabetes more effectively and precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu3700" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; appears in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's been widely accepted that metformin lowers &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood glucose&lt;/a&gt; primarily by reducing glucose output in the liver. Other studies have found that it acts through the gut," said corresponding author Dr. Makoto Fukuda, associate professor of pediatrics—nutrition at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We looked into the brain as it is widely recognized as a key regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. We investigated whether and how the brain contributes to the anti-diabetic effects of metformin."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team focused on a small protein called Rap1, found in a specific part of the brain known as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). The researchers discovered that metformin's ability to lower blood sugar at clinically relevant doses depends on turning off Rap1 in this brain region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this, Fukuda and his colleagues used genetically modified mice that lacked Rap1 in their VMH. These mice were fed a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high-fat+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-fat diet&lt;/a&gt; to mimic type 2 diabetes. When given low doses of metformin, the drug failed to lower their blood sugar. However, other diabetes medications like insulin and GLP-1 agonists still worked.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;To further show that the brain is a key player, the researchers injected tiny amounts of metformin directly into the brains of diabetic mice. The result was a significant drop in blood sugar, even with doses thousands of times smaller than what's typically given by mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also investigated which cells in the VMH were involved in mediating metformin's effects," Fukuda said. "We found that SF1 neurons are activated when metformin is introduced into the brain, suggesting they're directly involved in the drug's action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain slices, the scientists recorded the electrical activity of these neurons. Metformin made most of them more active, but only if Rap1 was present. In mice lacking Rap1 in these neurons, metformin had no effect, showing that Rap1 is essential for metformin to "switch on" these &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt; and lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This discovery changes how we think about metformin," Fukuda said. "It's not just working in the liver or the gut, it's also acting in the brain. We found that while the liver and intestines need high concentrations of the drug to respond, the brain reacts to much lower levels."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although few anti-diabetic drugs act on the brain, this study shows that widely used metformin has been doing so all along. "These findings open the door to developing new diabetes treatments that directly target this pathway in the brain," Fukuda said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metformin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; is known for other health benefits, such as slowing brain aging. We plan to investigate whether this same brain Rap1 signaling is responsible for other well-documented effects of the drug on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;

You are lifting stress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Paloma's twin brother Gabriel also asked her: "Did you explicitly tell her this will not treat her cancer?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Scotson said: "She knew it wasn't treating her cancer in a direct way. I was treating her whole body and her wellbeing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;When asked by Gabriel if she had left it "deliberately vague", she replied: "I never said I was treating her cancer and she wasn't certain that she had cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The inquest continues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 17:35:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBTaFRfbVJycmtmYkdjczBwSFZfZjd4UnV2RnFndGs2M2JMbmtPRnJHY1F3WnBxcy1aTE5QSTJXOGU4QnBGU3RWTFFLcTlmN1dTdndvVUxWV0tEUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5sSkZtOU1MQVVZcEJrdlBZM2cyYlY5aGxQZ042N2ZZOUFkajdOR1dTSy1EbHFtd2NUYXh2Z3FKRUFPUjhFUk1mb1EyWE1FVENoLS1mM09nSlJRS0paeTZR</guid></item><item><title>传染病更新2025年7月30日-每日科斯</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQek1YWVpLb1hiOW5wdkFJSjJaRGdCekJlbXlEVk9aaFhjSHAwaEtzVXcwVU5JRTNHeFVETkVTaHRhNEdjTlgtNDY3V1ZmSWhZVHZNdzBvMG5xSTlQc1VRLThQQjQyakN5YzRTb25YVjRxdnNvdGlVUGFsRHowQWhudE52UVptdUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Our periodic reminder that there are many bird flus out there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/china-reports-more-h9n2-activity" target="_blank"&gt;China reports more H9N2 human cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[same link] Multidrug resistant Salmonella is spreading in poultry.  Make sure to sterilize those cutting boards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/cambodian-boy-icu-h5n1-avian-flu-infection" target="_blank"&gt;Cambodia's thirteenth H5N1 case of this year is in ICU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/h5n1-avian-flu-hospitalizes-cambodian-man" target="_blank"&gt;And so is the fourteenth case, reported just yesterday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World health organizations say the risk to the general population is low, but it is low to moderate for those with occupational exposure [ya think?]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 16 new human cases since April noted in the risk assessment, all were previously reported, including 9 from Cambodia. Of 14 poultry outbreaks included during the period, 9 occurred in the vicinity of human cases. The other human cases were in Bangladesh, India, China, Mexico, and Vietnam. Three different H5N1 clades were involved: 2.3.2.1a from India and Bangladesh, 2.3.2.1e from Cambodia, and 2.3.4.4b from China and Mexico. &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The report didn't note the clade for Vietnam's case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside ongoing circulation in poultry and wild birds, some of the new detections in animals included H5N1 in captive serval cats in Bangladesh, domestic cats on a poultry farm in Belgium, milk from a single sheep in the United Kingdom, poultry breeder birds at a farm in Brazil, and harbor seals and sea otters in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is not lost. A study in ferrets suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/ferret-study-suggests-seasonal-flu-immunity-may-protect-against-severe" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Seasonal flu immunity may protect against severe disease from H5N1&lt;/a&gt;.  Current seasonal flus are H1N1 and H3N2, with the former offering the most cross immunity. Flu B immunity offered no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/africa-cdc-warns-exponential-mpox-spread-guinea" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Mpox is spreading exponentially in Guinea.&lt;/a&gt; Other countries also see worrisome rises, and vaccine supplies are dwindling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delivery of all earlier mpox vaccine deliveries has now been completed, following allocation planning, Boum said, emphasizing that the region has no more doses to distribute. Though 800,000 doses are available from mpox vaccine manufacturer Bavarian Nordic, the region and its partners, including UNICEF, have no funding to buy and deploy them, partly due to cutbacks in global health spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa CDC has estimated that 3.4 million doses are needed to meet the current demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-restaurants-and-retailers-not-serve-or-sell-and-consumers-not-eat-certain-frozen-raw-1" target="_blank"&gt;Norovirus contamination in oysters from Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/us-covid-levels-continue-slight-upward-trend" target="_blank"&gt;Covid detections trend slightly upward.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/about-polio/polio-this-week/" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine-derived polio cases and environmental samples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/malaria/new-findings-support-ivermectin-malaria-control" target="_blank"&gt;Ivermectin can contribute to malaria control&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a novel approach.  Apparently when people take monthly doses of ivermectin, mosquitoes that bite them die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatricians is &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/aap-calls-end-nonmedical-vaccine-exemptions-school-attendance" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Calling for an end to non-medical vaccine exemptions for school attendance&lt;/a&gt;.  Good luck with that in red states.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Given the precarious state of public health agencies under the Orange Menace, it is my hope that the information &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; can be infectious, spread widely to all your contacts, in the hope of promoting self-defense from disease. Knowledge is the best inoculation against misinformation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by a recurrent or persistent sadness and a loss of interest in activities that were previously deemed pleasurable, sometimes accompanied by changes in sleep, appetite and perceived energy levels. One of the most debilitating types of depression is major depressive disorder (MDD), which entails a pervasive low mood for a prolonged time, which in turn adversely impacts people's ability to engage in daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; is estimated to be experienced by approximately 3.5% of people worldwide, understanding its neurophysiological underpinnings and its characteristic brain signatures is of utmost importance. Past studies have linked depression, particularly MDD, to structural changes in a brain region known as the medial temporal lobe, which has been implicated in the formation and retrieval of memories, as well as in emotional processing and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Aachen University and Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH recently carried out a study aimed at exploring the link between the structure of a specific part of the MTL, namely the parahippocampal cortex (PHC), and MDD. Their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03435-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, suggests that the thickness of the PHC is an indicator of both MDD and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neuroticism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neuroticism&lt;/a&gt;, a psychological trait marked by a pronounced tendency to feel &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/negative+emotions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;negative emotions&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., anxiety, guilt, anger, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The PHC is a highly interconnected region within the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medial+temporal+lobe/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medial temporal lobe&lt;/a&gt; (MTL) and is essential in memory, emotion and cognition," wrote Dominik Nießen, Ravichandran Rajkumar and their colleagues in their paper. "According to the cognitive model of depression, dysfunctions in these processes constitute the pathophysiological foundation of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/major+depressive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;major depressive disorder&lt;/a&gt; (MDD). Research suggests that human personality, and neuroticism in particular, play an important role in the development and disease progression of MDD."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, recent neuroscience studies found that the brains of people diagnosed with depression and those scoring higher on recognized tests of neuroticism often share some similarities, some of which relate to the PHC. The PHC is a part of the MTL found to support various cognitive functions, including spatial processing, as well as the encoding and retrieval of emotional memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key objective of the recent study by Nießen, Rajkumar and their colleagues was to further investigate how the overall structure of the PHC varies in individuals diagnosed with MDD or exhibiting higher levels of neuroticism. To do this, they scanned the brains of several individuals, some of whom were diagnosed with MDD, using a neuroimaging technique known as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In a matched sample of 86 adults (43 MDD patients, 43 control participants, mean age 31.4 years, range 18–61 years, 40 female), PHC thickness was measured using structural MRI at an ultra-high field strength of 7 T and compared to the level of neuroticism as measured by the NEO-FFI scale," explained Nießen, Rajkumar and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers subsequently analyzed the brain scans collected from the study participants in conjunction with their mental health information and ratings on neuroticism tests. Overall, their findings suggest the PHC of people diagnosed with MDD and rating higher on neuroticism scales is thinner than that of individuals with low neuroticism ratings and no reported mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"MDD patients exhibited significantly lower left hemispheric PHC thickness compared to healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;fdr&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.119)," wrote the authors. "Additionally, linear regression analysis revealed a significant association between neuroticism and PHC thickness within both hemispheres (L: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;fdr&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, β = −0.414; R: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;fdr&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008, β = −0.512), with highly neurotic individuals displaying reduced cortical thickness. These findings suggest that, in combination with neuroticism, PHC thickness could serve as a potential biomarker of depression."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent work by Nießen, Rajkumar and their colleagues identifies a new potential biomarker that could contribute to the diagnosis and understanding of persistent cases of depression. In the future, this team's findings could inspire other &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+researchers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical researchers&lt;/a&gt; and neuroscientists to closely examine the possible role of the PHC in depression and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results underscore the importance of multimodal assessments in MDD, potentially contributing to the foundation of individualized clinical decision-making and paving the way towards precision psychiatry," wrote the authors.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of these tests are still in early development.

These would set the underpinnings of the heart-age test. (Most of the metrics used in the calculator are standard, but some are more specialized, such as an &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr" target="_blank"&gt;eGFR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr" target="_blank"&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;which tests kidney function.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CGKRYN5NIBG4RHFYXQSBAF37NQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Then, since they were interested in the state of heart health in America, they checked the heart ages of more than 14,000 men and women enrolled in the government’s huge and ongoing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-atp-questions" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C6JZ6TEOYBFLRPH7SCX5R3ZVZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But even many people in their 30s had relatively old hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="F62HJZNXCRBT3HBPCIGJNW2ZWM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="F62HJZNXCRBT3HBPCIGJNW2ZWM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What to do about an aging heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3XMMD6OE5BHKJASNNMBS5Q3QLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What does it mean if the calculator says your heart is older than you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SOF3KIGAGVHSTEOZNQJZI2XFJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“First, it’s important to have context,” Khan said. “A year’s difference from your chronological age is probably not meaningful.

His group has developed its own free, online &lt;a href="https://fitnessage.miahealth.no/en" target="_blank"&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt;, based on exercise and endurance, that estimates your fitness age in comparison with your chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3NEELNEIZNGS7IYOOM5OTWBO4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The key point about all of these biological-age calculators, whether they focus on fitness or organs, such as hearts, is that they can serve as a wake-up call, Gulati said. If the numbers indicate your heart might be aging too rapidly, that’s a message that you probably need to be paying some more attention to your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OJT443WZGJAVJJEQYW34NUDABE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I do think” the heart-age calculator “is a bit gimmicky,” Gulati said. “But if it helps to motivate a patient to make changes, I’m here for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJCSBX3EJZEXHDPDBGOTAQKI3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a fitness question?

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is treated with antibiotics including azithromycin, fluoroquinolones (like levofloxacin or moxifloxacin), and sometimes doxycycline or rifampin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-b39120e0-6d41-11f0-a915-e3a1fd4ab79e" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; reports that cases of Legionnaires' disease have been increasing since the early 2000s and hit a peak in 2018 with 9,933 confirmed cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to reporting discrepancies and various databases, data on the number of legionnaires' cases and deaths is fragmented and varies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, according to the CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDS), from 2000 through 2019, a total of 82,352 confirmed Legionnaires’ disease cases were reported from 52 US jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 10 people who become sick will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The odds of death are higher when the disease is contracted in a hospital setting, with at least one in four dying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most reliable way to determine if your water is contaminated with Legionella is to have it tested by a qualified laboratory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Home testing kits are also available, which involve collecting water samples and sending them to a lab for analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, one person died and several were hospitalized due to an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at a senior living facility in Vermont. It originated from the care home's water system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In general, the CDC reports that cases of Legionnaires' disease have been increasing since the early 2000s, with a peak in 2018 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Legionella can colonize and grow within complex communities of microorganisms called biofilms that form on surfaces within water systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once there, the bacteria seeps into the water and becomes aerosolized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plumbing systems, especially those associated with warm water, such as hot water tanks and distribution pipes, can also serve as reservoirs for Legionella bacteria to multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From there it can contaminate water in pipes. Stagnant or low-flow areas in pipes also foster Legionella growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-7b200640-6d46-11f0-a65b-29defdbea910" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14954791/Legionnaires-disease-death-Michigan-cases.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;WHAT IS LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia that causes lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is caused by a bacterium, known as Legionella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 500 people in the UK and 6,100 in the US suffer every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition can cause life-threatening complications, including respiratory failure, kidney failure and septic shock, which occurs when blood flow to the vital organs is blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most sufferers become ill by inhaling tiny water droplets from infected sources, such as shower heads, hot tubs, swimming pools or ventilation systems in buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone can become infected, however, at-risk people include the elderly, smokers and those with suppressed immune systems, such as chemotherapy patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms usually develop between two and 10 days after exposure to the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle Pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Fever and chills &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People may then experience:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough, which may bring up blood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breathlessness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Confusion &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment is antibiotics, usually in hospital, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prevention involves meticulous cleaning and disinfection of water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People can reduce their risk by not smoking as this damages the lungs and makes individuals more susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Source: Mayo Clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 16:17:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPZE1jeVFNc3QtdDZpSmIxMmJfUXJZVVlScndEYnB6V0NHR0gxRU9kMl9MWGF4WWF2dUpFZ3FVcUtWaUtna1B0UHhCWXJmTnFCV2o0d2ZpbEQyQ2x1QUhEd3lubjBxclUwUklsMzhULVBVNXRsUWFCVWhpSDZJb3k5T0tYUFFmQjZva1BwWGs1T2k0aGdTcmRfazdBRjBoY2PSAaQBQVVfeXFMTm1PRjJyU1dHVnFSUnE1QXBkRE1QbEtZQVNxbHBhd3ZkeVJpYjZia1psNkpCRzl2NzQwSUJ4OFNoV3B5WTVpckYySDRHVGJWUTVpSi1DUUJYTjlwZFdTbmE4czJyaGwyc1hCYXkycUlpSGdpcHczNkhfZ0J3NjVJNVpLb3A4UF8yUGJxRjdxNjZvZEdQS3NSbFhUVHdwcUhGZ0V0ZUk</guid></item><item><title>为什么随着年龄的增长保护您的听力非常重要–以及专家的建议- theguardian.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQV0lJVHk2VVc1YUY1eF9qSndQZEhHRUVBSFJabENjUnoxT1BMWC1POHlTa2lqamlyRnhWN096dHB4OW1kWk5LOHppdGVOQ2FXMndMQjhfNEt5a29tVTVRak1xNW5LQ285clQtVTl5X3NJaV9oRGdVX0ROZDlKbUxIRjlnYlhTNnFEMGI0Z0pkb05sYjVreW93aDFaUzFNUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2832869" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; examined the potential link between hearing loss and dementia, suggesting that treating hearing loss can help the brain. Although the possible connection is still being untangled, study co-author and audiologist &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/nicholas-s-reed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nicholas Reed&lt;/a&gt; advises prioritizing hearing health regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are already more than enough established benefits related to hearing care,” says Reed, a faculty member of the NYU Langone &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Optimal Aging Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/series/the-joys-of-aging","type":"Series","title":"The joys of ageing"},{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"science/ageing","type":"Keyword","title":"Ageing"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/sarah-sloat","type":"Contributor","title":"Sarah Sloat"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/jul/30/hearing-loss-clarity-cognitive-decline-isolation","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;What’s especially important about supporting hearing health is the effect it has on keeping people engaged in the world, Reed explains. Here’s what experts recommend in order to support your hearing as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-hearing-loss-occur" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How does hearing loss occur?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hearing loss can result from a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;wide range&lt;/a&gt; of genetic and environmental factors, such as chronic diseases and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7541613/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;. Some also experience age-related hearing loss, called &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/age-related-hearing-loss" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;presbycusis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hearing loss is “not about volume”, Reed explains. Instead, it’s a clarity issue. We lose our hearing at different frequencies at different rates, which can make sounds garbled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4dea5699-6992-4b84-88a5-d2ad1826eaab" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I thought I was a bad listener.

Other conditions can seem more pressing, and hearing loss becomes a low priority. There can be “downstream effects” in a healthcare context because hearing loss can hinder patient-provider communication, says Reed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-relationship-between-hearing-loss-and-dementia" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is the relationship between hearing loss and dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Early research suggests that hearing loss is associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3869227/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increased cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21320988/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an increased risk of new cases of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, although further studies are needed to understand this connection. Researchers have not, however, found a cause-and-effect relationship between hearing loss and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Reed and his colleagues wanted to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2832869" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;calculate the number of cases of dementia&lt;/a&gt; there could be in a population if a potential risk factor, in this case hearing loss, was eliminated. They used a sample of nearly 3,000 adults aged 66 to 90 and found 32% of the dementia risk in the sample group was potentially associated with audiometric hearing loss (hearing loss measured through testing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the authors, these results suggest that treating hearing loss may delay the onset of dementia in some older adults. However, this research cannot establish whether hearing loss causes dementia, explains co-author Jason Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One potential reason hearing loss is associated with cognitive changes is that it can lead to more social isolation, which may strain the brain and affect memory, says Reed. Another theory is that because auditory signals stimulate the brain, the lack of stimulation caused by hearing loss can lead to accelerated &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9649369/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;brain atrophy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"05596153-ddcc-440b-b05d-469b83a67176","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="05596153-ddcc-440b-b05d-469b83a67176" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If hearing problems are linked to an increased risk of dementia, are there ways to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/1/afaf004/7965371?login=false" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reduce that risk?&lt;/a&gt; An influential 2020 Lancet &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; recommended the use of hearing aids and protecting ears from excessive noise exposure.

But certain &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/hearing-and-hearing-loss/hearing-loss-common-problem-older-adults" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as age-related changes to the inner ear and auditory nerve, as well as genetics, are beyond our control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We can still mitigate the likelihood of damage from other causes. For example, we can manage conditions associated with hearing loss, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41440-021-00789-w" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/diabetes-complications/diabetes-and-hearing-loss.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. We can also limit exposure to sources of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240020481" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;damaging noise&lt;/a&gt;, like construction equipment, lawn mowers, motorcycles and loud music. Small actions, like protecting your hearing at a loud concert with over-ear headphones, which Reed prefers to earplugs, can have a big impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-18" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Establishing a baseline can help you identify changes over time, and indicate if and when new habits might be useful. The longer you live with impaired hearing, the harder it is to adjust to tools like hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-possible-to-reverse-hearing-loss" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is it possible to reverse hearing loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several treatments and devices can help alleviate hearing loss, but their effectiveness depends on the individual. If you suspect you have hearing issues, it’s best to have your hearing checked and discuss options with your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hearing aids can be purchased &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/hearing-aids-and-personal-sound-amplification-products-what-know" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;over-the-counter&lt;/a&gt; or with a prescription. Reed says learning how to wear them takes &lt;a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-to-adjust-to-hearing-aids/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;time and practice&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a critical public health need to &lt;a href="https://mostpolicyinitiative.org/science-note/hearing-aids-and-medicaid/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;expand coverage&lt;/a&gt; for these tools, says Smith, because it’s well-established that hearing aids can improve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While studies haven’t proven that hearing aids will delay dementia, scientists are intrigued by their potential to support brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The idea is that, in theory, if a person uses hearing aids, communication becomes easier and you lower the burden of cognitive load,” says Reed. “You’re stimulating the brain with more auditory signals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Staying engaged in social networks is key to maintaining mental and physical wellbeing, says Reed. In a 2025 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2833601" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Reed and colleagues found that, among people with hearing loss, participants who received hearing aids and were counseled on their use experienced less loneliness and social isolation. They also had more varied types of connections, such as friends, family and acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Similarly, assistive &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/assistive-devices-people-hearing-voice-speech-or-language-disorders" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt; may help. These range widely in function and design, but generally amplify sound, reduce background noise, and improve communication. For example, &lt;a href="https://mn.gov/deaf-hard-of-hearing/assistive-technology/apps/#:~:text=Some%20examples%20of%20speech%2Dto%2Dtext%20apps:%20*%20Ava,(iOS%2C%20Android%2C%20Windows)%20*%20Otter.ai%20(iOS%2C%20Android)" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt; that convert speech to text can assist with phone calls, and personal amplifiers can enhance hearing in conversations. People with mild to moderate hearing loss may find some relief in settings like crowded restaurants through items like the Apple AirPods Pro 2, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/26/apple-airpods-pro-2-hearing-aids-use-australia-tga" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;feature a built-in hearing aid&lt;/a&gt;, says Reed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In some instances, what can help a person manage hearing loss best is how they are supported by their community. There’s a need for more equitable environments that support people with sensory health needs, says Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some communication tips can go really far,” says Reed. “Good communication is looking someone in the face. It’s speaking slowly. It’s about rephrasing and adding context.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>theguardian.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQV0lJVHk2VVc1YUY1eF9qSndQZEhHRUVBSFJabENjUnoxT1BMWC1POHlTa2lqamlyRnhWN096dHB4OW1kWk5LOHppdGVOQ2FXMndMQjhfNEt5a29tVTVRak1xNW5LQ285clQtVTl5X3NJaV9oRGdVX0ROZDlKbUxIRjlnYlhTNnFEMGI0Z0pkb05sYjVreW93aDFaUzFNUQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
