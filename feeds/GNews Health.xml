He called on the journal to “immediately retract” the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I see no reason for retraction,” Dr Christine Laine, editor in chief of the Annals of Internal Medicine and a professor of medicine at Thomas Jefferson University, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The journal plans to respond to criticism the article has received on its website, Laine said, but it does not intend to respond directly to Kennedy’s piece, which was not submitted to the journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lead author of the study, Anders Peter Hviid, head of the epidemiology research department at the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, defended the work in a response post to TrialSite. He wrote that none of the critiques put forward by Kennedy were substantive and he categorically denied any deceit as implied by the secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I am used to controversy around vaccine safety studies – especially those that relate to autism, but I have not been targeted by a political figurehead in this way before,” Hviid said in an emailed response to Reuters. “I have confidence in our work and in our ability to reply to the critiques of our study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy had a number of criticisms, including the lack of a control group, that the study deliberately excluded different groups of children to avoid showing a link between aluminum and childhood health conditions – including those with the highest levels of exposure – and that it did not include the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hviid responded to the criticisms on TrialSite. He said some of the points were related to study design choices that were reasonable to discuss but refuted others, including that the study was designed not to find a link. In fact, he said, its design was based on a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36180331/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study led by Matthew Daley&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, which did show a link, and which Kennedy cited in his article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was no control group because in Denmark only 2% of children were unvaccinated, which was too small for meaningful comparison, Hviid added. The data was available for researchers to analyze, but individual-level data was not released under Danish law, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other prominent vaccine skeptics including those at the antivaccine organization Kennedy previously ran, Children’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Defense, have similarly criticized the study on the Annals of Internal Medicine site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;TrialSite staff defended the study for its scale, data transparency and funding while acknowledging the limitations of its design, a view seconded by some outside scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Laine said that while some of the issues Kennedy raised in his article may underscore acceptable limitations of the study, “they do not invalidate what they found, and there’s no evidence of scientific misconduct”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the department had “no further comment than what the secretary said”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 12:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQYllINkJWN2FTaXRtOWtSNTBuZ0ViRWRUYnp0MVhXbnhINVZ6bUhPUUlZTWRkM0xMWFJ0SV9xdnNjQXZWelFBY2FHbjM4ZkRkdlhBcFREc3d0V3l2RWw5UzltVzJ0eDI1OTBBbVJ1WTRWajlpTGZFeHdkZkJBYU9KMGNBTWQ1UElrMWNTaERtQktiNmxZ</guid></item><item><title>医生警告这11种日常食物可能会破坏您的肠道健康- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE5KRy00a3djcUMxNmdpeWxBTWY4S0UwZFZvbTQ5WHdxOXpHM0NoM0FRUHVjeHk5ZEp3R3RBX1d5dXZzMUhtLVk1RW44SXpCVGxOX1lqXzE1bU5jbW1yZ0U4eFpLQ20tVVhUQTZlaFBudGJQOG8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;11 Surprising Foods That Cause Diarrhea&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;milan2099 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watery stools, a.k.a. diarrhea, are annoying at best and terribly unpleasant at worst. While most bouts are caused by a virus or bacteria, per the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/diarrhea/symptoms-causes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH), and aren't typically a cause for concern, there are also many common foods that can cause diarrhea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If you suspect that food, rather than an illness, is causing your diarrhea (or other bothersome digestive woes), there's an easy way to identify the culprit. “The best way to investigate which foods are making your symptoms worse is to keep a food diary,” said gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://shilparavella.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shilpa Ravella, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shilpa Ravella, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;. Simply write down everything you eat each day, how you feel after eating, and if and when you have any unpleasant trips to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: Gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://shilparavella.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shilpa Ravella, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shilpa Ravella, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.metrohealth.org/physician/bhavesh-shah-029348" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bhavesh Shah, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bhavesh Shah, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist and Director of Advanced Endoscopy at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland; &lt;a href="https://celiacdiseasecenter.columbia.edu/about-the-center/celiac-disease-center-team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anne Roland Lee, Ed.D, R.D.N., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anne Roland Lee, Ed.D, R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of nutritional medicine in the celiac disease center at Columbia University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help streamline the process, we narrowed down the most likely foods that cause diarrhea. Ahead, GI doctors share the most common culprits to watch out for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sugar Substitutes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet sodas and sugar-free snacks and chewing gum may help satisfy your sweet tooth, but many contain sugar substitutes that can also act as a laxative. “Sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and sorbitol can contribute to diarrhea and bloating based on how your body metabolizes them in the gut,” said gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://www.metrohealth.org/physician/bhavesh-shah-029348" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bhavesh Shah, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bhavesh Shah, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the Director of Advanced Endoscopy at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland. Recent research in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(23)02607-X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:iScience;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;iScience&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;also found that artificial sweeteners can alter the composition of the gut microbiome, disrupting the balance of healthy bacteria and further contributing to issues like diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Sammyvision - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coffee&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your morning cup promptly followed by a rush to the bathroom? That’s pretty normal. In fact, up to 29% of people report feeling the urge to go after sipping a cup of coffee, according to the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-does-coffee-make-you-poop" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. “Coffee can cause diarrhea in some people,” Dr. Ravella said. “The caffeine can stimulate the gut to contract more quickly than it normally does, so food moves through faster and isn’t absorbed as well.” The acidity of coffee can also worsen the symptoms of some digestive disorders, such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20496948/6-weird-signs-you-have-acid-reflux/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acid reflux;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acid reflux&lt;/a&gt;. Other caffeinated foods and drinks, including tea and energy drinks, could have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;fotograzia - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a few too many during a night out (or in!), you may wake up with an upset stomach the next morning. “This is often a symptom that accompanies a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/life/a22789047/hangover-cures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hangover;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hangover&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Shah said. “Alcohol is an irritant. Your gut may not agree with drinking a large amount.” Booze also speeds up digestion and pulls water into your digestive tract, per the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/diarrhea-after-drinking-alcohol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;—hence the liquid stools when you’re hungover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;marina200707 / 500px - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dairy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/documents/NICHD_MM_Lactose_FS_rev.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;, up to 50 million American adults may be lactose intolerant and could benefit from limiting their consumption of dairy or cutting it out altogether. If your stomach goes rogue when you eat milk, cheese, or yogurt, you may be one of them. “Common symptoms, which begin about 30 minutes to two hours after consuming foods containing lactose, may be diarrhea, nausea, cramps, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20472936/best-remedies-for-gas-and-bloating/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gas, and bloating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gas, and bloating&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Image Source - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wheat, Rye, and Barley&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gluten—a mix of proteins found in wheat, rye, and barley—can cause diarrhea and bloating for up to 15% of people, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/nutrition/go-with-your-gut-4-facts-about-gluten-intolerance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Northwestern Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Northwestern Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping track of any GI symptoms you experience after eating bread, pasta, and grains or cutting out these foods to see if your symptoms disappear will help you find out if you're one of them. “If you think you have gluten intolerance, it’s important to see a gastroenterologist to make sure you don’t have celiac disease,” Dr. Ravella added. For people with this disorder, gluten can do serious damage by causing the body to attack the lining of the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;apomares - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Condiments and Salad Dressings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Store-bought condiments, dressings, and sauces might contain traces of gluten in the form of ingredients like malt vinegar or wheat starch to help thicken the texture and add flavor, said &lt;a href="https://celiacdiseasecenter.columbia.edu/about-the-center/celiac-disease-center-team/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anne Roland Lee, Ed.D, R.D.N., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anne Roland Lee, Ed.D, R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of nutritional medicine in the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University. Try preparing your own dressings and sauces at home if you have a gluten intolerance, or carefully read the ingredient labels at the store to avoid any hidden triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Jeff Greenberg - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;High-FODMAP Foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. They’re a group of carbs and sugar alcohols that can be tough to digest, especially for people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Dr. Ravella said, leading to gas, bloating, and diarrhea. A &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a19756314/fodmap-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low-FODMAP diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; may help improve symptoms, but should be monitored by a dietitian, as it requires you to cut out certain foods rich in vital nutrients. According to &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/fodmap-diet-what-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, High-FODMAP foods include dairy, wheat, beans, lentils, artichokes, asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, onions, garlic, apples, cherries, and peaches, while foods low in FODMAPs include eggs, meat, rice, quinoa, potatoes, eggplant, tomatoes, cucumbers, grapes, pineapple, and berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Thanasis - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;High-Fiber Foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber gets your digestive system moving, which is a good thing—but sometimes it’s a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; effective, Dr. Shah warned. Fiber binds with water, which can help prevent constipation but may also have a laxative effect if you consume too much at once. Plus, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/fiber-and-lactose" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UCSF Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UCSF Health&lt;/a&gt;, eating a lot of insoluble fiber (the type found in nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and whole grains) can speed up digestion, leading to watery stool.

"You've got to make sure that the infant and the child get enough of the nutrients that they need to grow and develop properly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Younger children have a high requirement for energy micronutrients, and as a result "animal-sourced foods are a good option because they provide all of those nutrients", Fewtrell says. "If you just give them plants, they're very high in fibre. It fills them up, and then there's a risk that they may not then be able to consume enough nutrients because the nutrient density can be very low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Fewtrell has co-authored &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/5/723" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have found &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522007341?via%3Dihub" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vegan and vegetarian&lt;/a&gt; children who don't supplement are at risk of being deficient in Vitamin B12, iodine and iron.

                There's a growing consensus among researchers on how many daily steps are needed to improve health.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;From pricey wearable devices to your phone, it has never been easier to track your daily physical activity, or lack of it. And if you're like many Americans — and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8595506/" target="_blank"&gt;spend 9-plus hours&lt;/a&gt; sitting everyday — chances are you could probably stand to&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213518585/so-much-sitting-looking-at-screens-can-we-combat-our-sedentary-lives" target="_blank"&gt; take a few more steps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But just how many should you aim for if you want to live a longer and healthier life? New research suggests 7,000 is a good target.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have made big strides in the science of step-taking over the past decade, gathering tons of data.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And no surprise, they find the more you move, the less likely you are to die from cardiovascular disease and other ailments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, they've also concluded that the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/29/727943418/do-you-really-need-10-000-steps-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;widely-cited target&lt;/a&gt; of 10,000 steps is not rooted in solid science — it grew out of a Japanese promotional campaign.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, a number of studies have now landed on a new number to keep in our heads as we trudge through the day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;7,000 steps tends to be the range where there seems to be diminishing return on investment for increasing more steps," says &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/melody-ding.html" target="_blank"&gt;Melody Ding&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ding is the latest researcher to dive into the evidence, as part of an effort to update the physical activity guidelines in her country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her team reviewed data collected from more than 160,000 adults around the world on the link between step count and a variety of health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among their findings: Taking 7,000 steps per day was associated with nearly a 50% lower risk of dying compared to the bare minimum of 2,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study,&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00164-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet Public Health&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; also showed the chance of developing cancer fell by 25%, type 2 diabetes 14%, cardiovascular disease 25%, symptoms of depression 22% and dementia 38%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, Ding says there were still &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; improvements for those who exceeded 7,000 steps, but overall they saw "diminishing returns on investment," meaning the added health benefits across the population become smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It definitely doesn't do harm if you go beyond 7,000," she says, "So for anyone who's already doing 10,000 and more, there is no point of going back, but for the folks who are finding it harder to get there, 7,000 could be a really realistic target."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research underscores that, on the lower end, even a modest jump in steps can have a major impact on your well-being.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, simply jumping from 2,000 to 4,000 steps in a day was accompanied by nearly a 36% lower risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The work from Ding's team reflects a growing consensus in the scientific literature that around 7,000 steps could be a reasonable target for the public. (There is some variation in the exact number depending on the study.) &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/public-health-sciences/about/directory/amanda-paluch" target="_blank"&gt;Amanda Paluch&lt;/a&gt;, who has &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2783711" target="_blank"&gt;published two meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt; on step count and health, has found a similar range as this latest study, though her work suggests the step targets may also vary with age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We were seeing that older adults did not seem to need as many steps compared to younger adults," says Paluch, a physical activity epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Specifically, Paluch's &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; the decreased risk of dying appeared to plateau between 6,000 to 8,000 steps for people in their 60s and older, versus 8,000 to 10,000 for younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says this latest study is one of the first to consider a broader array of health outcomes than just mortality and cardiovascular disease, but cautions some of the results, such as those related to cancer, depression and dementia, are still somewhat "preliminary" because they're based on only a few studies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers have also tried to pin down whether speed makes a difference. Here, the new &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; study could not make any definitive conclusions, in part because there are various ways to measure intensity and differences could simply reflect better overall fitness and physical function.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;We actually don't see an association once we consider the total number of steps," says Paluch, who has also looked at this question. "So, essentially, the total number of steps, regardless of how fast you're walking, seems to have a benefit," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The federal government's current &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/PAG_Advisory_Committee_Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;physical activity guidelines&lt;/a&gt; don't actually recommend a daily step target. Instead, they focus on time, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/php/guidelines-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommending 150 to 300 &lt;/a&gt;minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week for adults, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes of vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://medicine.duke.edu/profile/william-erle-kraus" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. William Kraus&lt;/a&gt;, who worked on those guidelines, would love to see steps included the next time they are updated.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Because they're objective measures that anyone can get off their phone, right?" says Kraus, a cardiologist whose lab studies exercise and health at Duke University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says ultimately both approaches to measuring physical activity reflect the same thing  — the amount of energy being burned up through movement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What you're seeing is the more energy expenditure that you consume with physical activity, the greater benefit you get," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And because the point is to get physical activity – and expend energy – it doesn't have to be just steps. Kraus says you can translate one mile of walking into one fifth of a mile swimming, or five miles cycling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Melody Ding at the University of Sydney says she likes to think of movement in the same way as diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Just like we need a balanced, healthy diet, it's important for us to have balanced physical activity, training throughout the week as well," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In other words, get those steps, but also make time for mobility and strength training. All of it adds up.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;If you are counting steps, Kraus emphasizes that the evidence pointing to roughly 7,000 steps a day should not discount the value of doing &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; steps, even if the upsides that have been studied so far become incremental above that number.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Everybody wants to know how little I need to do. That is the wrong question," he says, "Anything is better than nothing, more is better than less."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What's more, the calculations appear to change when you factor in how much time people spend sitting.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He cites &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27475271/" target="_blank"&gt;evidence that suggests&lt;/a&gt; people need to aim higher than 7,000 or even 10,000 if they spend eight hours in a chair.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you can get 13,000 steps, you can get rid of all the negative risks that are associated with sitting, " he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked—the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																					&lt;p&gt;The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including "Frankenstein bunnies," "demon rabbits" and "zombie rabbits." But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+papillomavirus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; that causes &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cervical+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she said that it's not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/rabbit/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt; but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don't harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits' immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

This study suggests a depletion of a natural element, and how restoring that balance could potentially impact all the major hallmarks of the disease — the plaques, the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh4731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;tangles&lt;/a&gt;, and cognitive function itself,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parulekar said that these findings could potentially lead to new ways to both treat and detect Alzheimer’s disease, but in very different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of it like starting a healthy diet and exercise plan. If you start early, it can prevent heart disease. But even if you’ve already had a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151444" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, starting that same healthy plan can still help you. It won’t undo the past damage, but it will make your body stronger and help slow down future problems. Similarly, lithium seems to make the brain healthier and more resilient. So, it could be used as a treatment to protect the brain cells that are still healthy and slow down the progression of the disease in people who already have it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke to &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/g.-peter-gliebus/2730213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Peter Gliebus&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a neurologist, and director of cognitive and behavioral neurology at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, a part of Baptist Health South Florida, about this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gliebus, who was not involved in the recent study, said his first reaction to its findings is one of cautious optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s findings indicate that lithium exhibits a substantial impact on brain health and may mitigate the early molecular alterations associated with Alzheimer’s disease,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study underscores the potential of lithium replacement therapy as a preventive or therapeutic intervention. This discovery holds a promise as it presents novel avenues for addressing the disease at its earliest stages, potentially slowing or even halting its progression,” Gliebus explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“These findings have the potential to contribute to the early detection and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in the future,” he continued. The study shows lithium deficiency as an early indicator of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, potentially serving as a biomarker for early detection. Measuring lithium levels in the brain could enable the identification of individuals at higher risk of developing the disease.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, the therapeutic application of lithium orotate, which circumvents plaque sequestration, demonstrates promise in reversing or preventing pathological alterations in animal models,” Gliebus added. “If these findings are validated in human studies, lithium replacement therapy could emerge as a viable treatment option, particularly for individuals experiencing early cognitive decline or at elevated risk for Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 06:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPNkhxTUtXYl9TZ2l0QVRmSG0tWUxTdU5ISW04dDY4N1pDeFZydXdGbWJLdk5EZGpra29JbzNoUEJyRWVGcjV3MFFYUVBvS20tZEJvVG10UWhoSmZXYW5CcEVZM0wzMUxIb3Z3N0pHdEhQVEhadk0yalJ2T2lUeGpVTjhrT0l1RW1OZUtlRG0xRFNVTTFPLXFmZHp3bXN5bVI5OFliRA</guid></item><item><title>在科罗拉多州，有“角”的兔子被称为“弗兰肯斯坦兔子”。’原因如下-美联社新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPZzRWcjctUkJSMnFzalZUOGN2ZHI3LTVjYmtyVWg3WDZCd1ZlcDEzOXZjRkROdWMtcktaSl9NN21OYjhOeDNneEN4UlU2UmROaG9lWVYwZnZjWG4zLWJzTlloSnI4Q0VERXFaYy0tQVZVSGxNUlNCUUZtTF9IYXVUeUxod3pPOHg4TG9FblVfczljM3J1MHFLQmVwaGNDSmlZUS1KWlpZcmRzdGJMU2lBbkpFazN3Snhid3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 02:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPZzRWcjctUkJSMnFzalZUOGN2ZHI3LTVjYmtyVWg3WDZCd1ZlcDEzOXZjRkROdWMtcktaSl9NN21OYjhOeDNneEN4UlU2UmROaG9lWVYwZnZjWG4zLWJzTlloSnI4Q0VERXFaYy0tQVZVSGxNUlNCUUZtTF9IYXVUeUxod3pPOHg4TG9FblVfczljM3J1MHFLQmVwaGNDSmlZUS1KWlpZcmRzdGJMU2lBbkpFazN3Snhid3c</guid></item><item><title>1800万美国人遵循的肮脏习惯与惊人的精神分裂症激增有关-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQcGFrZHdrZS1Lb0V5WUhkX3JJQkk3eExQalhsNUthTEV4UHFicFVkamVtamNESmZkX2J1aU9HeERvdm9GSVRvVmVBZ2JIS0w1OUtCdHVZdmxFYjRtOEhfS2tfSEl5UGVfdjBhNk1WX0c0YXhSLWVkdG9waW42LWhnTWF1MzRZNVFxZnNnRTFqZlhWMUN6NUkwaUh3Njd1Vy1Xajh0ODFGdDYxS1VG0gGyAUFVX3lxTE95LWdtQ0tPa3BnR1FpRWhYcWJ1d0RSNFJqb3pNWVU3SERfdXV0dXcyNVpSVUUzX1Fya0IyTm1wcTBFWnZhUWpSajJGZHFyQnBrV2FwUWhEX1hOeGlNVUg2aTZLSTk1Z1dkYXkweUxzTWhSNG1HOTlhV2VBY3MyLUhJWmYyd2l4U0YtMllyWjhVUEtTRXFfX0JCQmFpcWZaaWdBUzUwM0toUkpVUnlFVGRGbmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 18 million Americans who use cannabis daily have drastically increased their odds of developing schizophrenia, a serious mental disorder that can lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The grim findings come from a new report by the Canadian Medical Association Journal which revealed that patients needing hospitalization because of cannabis-related health problems were 14 times more likely to develop schizophrenia within three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These symptoms could range from severe &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13482157/People-ancient-viruses-DNA-prone-depression-study-reveals.html"&gt;psychiatric symptoms&lt;/a&gt;

That's roughly one in every 200 users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, up to 76 percent of those who do experience these symptoms for more than 24 hours end up needing emergency care - sending their chances of developing schizophrenia skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schizophrenia is treated with a combination of antipsychotic medications, therapy, and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antipsychotic drugs, like risperidone and olanzapine can help manage symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions by balancing brain chemicals. Therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help patients cope with symptoms and improve their daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Approximately 18 millions Americans report using cannabis products on a daily basis (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for regular cannabis users who haven't developed mental health problems, study authors said there is one definitive way to reduce their risk: stop using cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreover, the report warned that continuing to use cannabis after an initial episode of psychosis led to an increased risk that the symptoms would return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using cannabis, especially high-potency products with more than 20 percent THC, can cause some people to experience severe nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rapid heart rate, chest pains that mimic a heart attack, or fainting can also occur and require an urgent trip to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overdosing on THC, particularly from consuming edibles or using vapes, can lead to extreme confusion, agitation, or a loss of coordination, all of which can increase the risk of a serious accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among users with pre-existing mental health conditions, cannabis-related health problems can include worsening symptoms of anxiety or depression, such as severe mood swings or suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cannabis’ status in the US has been complex for years, with recreational use legal in 24 states and Washington DC, and medical use allowed in 38 states as of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it remains a Schedule I drug federally, classified as highly dangerous with no accepted medical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Biden administration proposed moving cannabis to Schedule III in May 2024, recognizing its potential as a medical treatment, but a January 2025 hearing was canceled, leaving the decision to the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 01:42:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQcGFrZHdrZS1Lb0V5WUhkX3JJQkk3eExQalhsNUthTEV4UHFicFVkamVtamNESmZkX2J1aU9HeERvdm9GSVRvVmVBZ2JIS0w1OUtCdHVZdmxFYjRtOEhfS2tfSEl5UGVfdjBhNk1WX0c0YXhSLWVkdG9waW42LWhnTWF1MzRZNVFxZnNnRTFqZlhWMUN6NUkwaUh3Njd1Vy1Xajh0ODFGdDYxS1VG0gGyAUFVX3lxTE95LWdtQ0tPa3BnR1FpRWhYcWJ1d0RSNFJqb3pNWVU3SERfdXV0dXcyNVpSVUUzX1Fya0IyTm1wcTBFWnZhUWpSajJGZHFyQnBrV2FwUWhEX1hOeGlNVUg2aTZLSTk1Z1dkYXkweUxzTWhSNG1HOTlhV2VBY3MyLUhJWmYyd2l4U0YtMllyWjhVUEtTRXFfX0JCQmFpcWZaaWdBUzUwM0toUkpVUnlFVGRGbmc</guid></item><item><title>官员：鳕鱼角游泳运动员感染了可能导致“食肉”疾病的罕见细菌- Boston.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxOeFloOHFVekwxVzdzMDhseWZxMFhfYzZiS0hOSi1DdUtZLU1ZeXdwNXFEajNRYzVKR283WmRyaG0yVGNPTTdvbTdsc3kzR05vbmtQdWhlZHAtR1Bya2VXbTlVbXdrWU9CaVI3UjdMZTRBUi04eHQ2c3hDaEhkdEhIRU5DVHpDYV9TMHk3WWFaNnFGbG1Qazl3WjhvU1pFaGh4R1ZvQjhDY2xwTDVocmJrZnczekdYcVBiQ1RyUmVWay1lN3g0d0lQQnZ6ZS1ITWRSd1ZQS3p3Rl_SAeABQVVfeXFMTUY3dUJxNldPQkpQbHBHaGR3SDdra0lVUEVSdzFEYzJhMXk5WU8tdGRpNVFSZXdkQnRHVy1RSm03ZjBYSGc5WXliUXBJUEt5cF8wYmlFWHBwTlVOYlk3bkVUT2ZsRzlKREVxTEJSWXhCYkdJYnFsVkg2elhraTFxWVRoNVpSWXdibWk2WnNnT05xWDlpUTNUSDQ4U2hGUFVJX3czaDd0OWxxNGNxOEptUGdPRTZEMkdMM3kzTEpMYXl3OXZVZFZveWJaX0FheGZzZ2c1LXlGZmZscHp5cWpEdUY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="content-well content-well--article" role="main"&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts public health officials issued a warning Wednesday about the presence of a rare and potentially dangerous bacteria in the state’s coastal waters after a swimmer contracted an uncommon infection on &lt;a href="http://Boston.com/tag/cape-cod"&gt;Cape Cod&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vibrio vulnificus infection, from Vibrio bacteria, was identified last week in an “older individual” who went swimming with an exposed wound at Old Silver Beach in Falmouth, Falmouth and Barnstable County health officials &lt;a href="https://www.falmouthma.gov/1579/Vibrio-vulnificus"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old Silver Beach remains open, the Cape officials said, noting that the infections from the bacteria remain “extremely uncommon.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cape Cod’s beaches are an important part of our economy, culture, and community,” Scott McGann, health agent for the Town of Falmouth, said in a statement. “By taking a few simple precautions, residents and visitors, and particularly anyone who is vulnerable or immunocompromised, can continue to enjoy them safely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no way to monitor bathing water for Vibrio bacteria, according to Falmouth officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-health-alerts-public-to-rare-vibrio-vulnificus-bacteria-in-coastal-waters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;state health officials&lt;/a&gt;, there have been seven confirmed cases of Vibrio vulnificus in Massachusetts in the last several years, including four who were likely exposed in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections from the bacteria are more common in warmer waters along the Gulf Coast, according to public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, most infections from Vibrio bacteria result from people consuming shellfish containing the bacteria, state health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone exposed to the bacteria can get an infection, but immunocompromised people or those with a chronic illness, young children, and pregnant people are at greater risk from developing severe disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vibrio bacteria normally live in warm, salt or brackish waters along the Atlantic coast,” Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said in a statement. “Heat waves and above-average water surface temperatures create favorable conditions for Vibrio bacteria to grow, making May through October generally the peak season for these bacteria. People with open wounds who spend time in the water, or those who consume contaminated shellfish, can develop an infection when the bacteria enter the body. Sometimes these infections can spread through the bloodstream and cause severe, even life-threatening illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Vibrio infections can lead to the “flesh-eating” disease called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/group-a-strep/about/necrotizing-fasciitis.html"&gt;necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, which results in the death of the flesh around the infected wound, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control. Symptoms of a Vibrio infection include fever, chills, vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who have an open wound that has been exposed to warm, coastal waters are advised to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection for seven days and are advised to seek medical attention if they develop fever, chills, dangerously low blood pressure, blistering skin lesions or any redness, pain, swelling, warmth, discoloration, or discharge at the site of the wound,” state health officials said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent wound infections from Vibrio bacteria, health officials advise staying out of coastal waters or using a waterproof bandage over any open wounds. People with open wounds should also avoid handling raw seafood, and any wounds should be washed with soap and water after coming into contact with coastal water or raw shellfish, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’re really seriously considering not doing COVID vaccines this year,” said Laura Kittross, public health program manager for the Berkshire Regional Planning Commission, which coordinates with 18 Western Massachusetts municipalities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy’s open skepticism of vaccines and his recent decisions that include changing guidelines on who should get COVID vaccines have state officials and public health professionals questioning whether they can continue to rely on what used to be a smooth-running system. In response, Massachusetts officials are exploring creating an alternate vaccine policy, which could include an unprecedented collaboration with neighboring states to replicate some of the work federal health agencies&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;typically perform. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“At this moment we can’t always look to the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] for the guidance we received previously,” Dr. Robbie Goldstein, the state’s commissioner of the Department of Public Health, said during a DPH-hosted panel Wednesday that focused on vaccination. “This is a little bit of building the plane while we fly it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The discussion was eagerly awaited by health providers throughout Massachusetts who say keeping up with vaccine recommendations is difficult enough without conflicting messages from Washington. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Pediatricians are overwhelmed and really looking for guidance,” said Dr. Everett Lamm, cochair of the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Immunization Initiative. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Typically, a CDC advisory panel every June&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;recommends vaccines for seasonal spikes in flu, RSV, and, more recently, COVID. Under Kennedy, that process has been haphazard. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/09/business/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-fires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/09/business/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-fires/"&gt;he fired&lt;/a&gt; every member of the committee, and replaced them with a smaller group who generally have less experience with vaccines but share some of his political positions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;An HHS spokesperson said Kennedy considered the previous version of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, as a rubber stamp that failed to critically evaluate scientific evidence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has replaced vaccine groupthink with a diversity of viewpoints on ACIP,” the HHS statement said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The spokesperson did not reply to questions about the delayed COVID shot recommendations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The new ACIP committee members recommended &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/26/nation/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-vote-flu-vaccines-controversial-preservative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/26/nation/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-vote-flu-vaccines-controversial-preservative/"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; that thimerosal, a preservative, be eliminated from all vaccines. The mercury-containing compound is used in just 4 percent of flu doses in the United States but has long been associated, falsely, with autism. The panel’s decision to give credence to a debunked conspiracy theory alarmed health experts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think the level of trust for information coming out of the CDC right now is somewhere between negative one and zero,” said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota vaccine expert who participated in the forum Wednesday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For local authorities such as Kittross, the delay hinders efforts to protect people in one of the state’s least vaccinated regions. By this time last year, groups such as the regional planning commission would have begun ordering roughly 2,000 COVID vaccine doses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While Berkshire County’s lower inoculation rates are in part due to a streak of vaccine hesitancy, Kittross said, it is also a consequence of limited access to medical care in a rural area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think it’s really difficult for people here,” she said. “You don’t walk past a CVS on your way to work.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It isn’t too late to order COVID vaccine, she said, but the clock is ticking, and at roughly $120 a dose, it’s a cost local health departments cannot afford to foot without a guarantee insurers will reimburse them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Many of the state’s 351 local public health agencies face the same uncertainty, said Carlene Pavlos, executive director of the Massachusetts Public Health Alliance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Many are&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;not&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;making decisions about ordering vaccines until they know there will be insurance coverage,” she said. “If there isn’t, they will be unable to order.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Hospitals, too, are waiting to learn whether their workers will be required to get COVID shots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s time to preorder COVID vaccines, and we don’t even know who will qualify for COVID vaccines in the fall,” said Dr. Shira Doron, hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The website for the CDC advisory panel notes a meeting is expected to be held in August or September. If it does end up recommending COVID vaccines, providers would have time to obtain doses for the coming winter, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The confusion and changing guidance from the federal government prompted Governor Maura Healey to &lt;a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4251.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4251.pdf"&gt;propose legislation&lt;/a&gt; in July to give the state more leeway in determining which vaccines are covered by its&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Vaccine Purchase Trust Fund, which funds free inoculations for children. Right now, the fund can support only vaccines recommended by the CDC panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Massachusetts is in discussions with Connecticut, Maine, New York, and Rhode Island to coordinate vaccine recommendations without input from the CDC panel, public health officials said. While in the planning stages, states would likely rely on advice from national professional societies, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and Infectious Disease Society of America, to provide coordinated guidance to public health and medical providers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, an initiative run by Osterholm of the University of Minnesota called the Vaccine Integrity Project is gathering reams of information on vaccines to help professional societies make recommendations. He acknowledged it will not be able to replicate in total the work of the CDC advisory committee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“That was a pretty seamless system in terms of assessment,” &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Osterholm said. “I would just say that it’s our loss.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other health experts said it is important participating states coordinate recommendations, both to bolster public trust and increase the likelihood insurers will cover vaccines without federal approval. Each state giving its own vaccine recommendations would cause chaos, experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s OK for us to tweak the language a little bit but it’s not OK for each of us to have a different recommendation,” Goldstein said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It is unclear, though, if insurers, which are required to cover vaccines recommended by the CDC panel, would do the same for those  suggested  by regional public health collaboratives. In a statement, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Massachusetts’ largest private insurer, said it did not rely exclusively on CDC recommendations to determine what vaccines it would cover. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We strongly support vaccine access and view it as a critical part of public health and preventive care,” Blue Cross said in the statement. “When deciding what vaccinations to cover, we examine the published evidence as well as national guidelines from expert bodies.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Goldstein said other insurers have been open to relying on vaccine authorities other than the federal government. It saves insurers money to prevent costly illnesses in their customers, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;MassHealth, the state-run Medicaid program, said in a statement that it is able to cover vaccines not recommended by the CDC panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy has in many ways reshaped the federal public health apparatus to reflect his skeptical, and in some cases unproven views on vaccine safety and efficacy. The CDC lifted COVID vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women and this month Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/06/nation/mrna-vaccine-rfk-jr-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/06/nation/mrna-vaccine-rfk-jr-what-to-know/"&gt;canceled $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in federal funding for research to create new mRNA vaccines. MRNA vaccines protected millions of people during COVID and can be produced quickly, making them a potentially lifesaving resource during another pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yet even if Massachusetts can establish a vaccine policy independent of Washington, the fracturing of what used to be a consensus among public health authorities could worsen the country’s already significant undercurrent of vaccine hesitancy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think we’re already seeing that it’s impacting vaccination rates,” Goldstein said. “National rhetoric has increased vaccine hesitancy on all types of vaccines.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

				&lt;p&gt;The risk for West Nile virus is now considered “high” in 10 Massachusetts communities, state public health officials warned Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;opi=89978449&amp;amp;url=https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-public-health&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiAspK-_4iPAxWVFFkFHQ6RIWcQFnoECCAQAQ&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0X1Nt9w5EPciyZ4g-9AUvB"&gt;Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; said the level of West Nile virus is now considered high in Acton, Bedford, Billerica, Boston, Brookline, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Dracut, Lowell, and Newton, based on mosquito samples taken from those communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first West Nile virus-positive mosquitoes of the year were confirmed on June 17, and since then 168 samples have been detected across Barnstable, Berkshire, Bristol, Dukes, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester counties, DPH said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[West Nile virus] findings in mosquitoes have accelerated rapidly over the last several weeks,” State Epidemiologist Catherine Brown said in a statement. “We are now in the peak time for transmission of mosquito-borne disease to people and it is important for people to know that so they can take steps to protect themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no human cases of West Nile yet this year, but a goat in Lunenburg was diagnosed with the illness. Nineteen people in the state contracted the illness last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t experience symptoms, but some can develop headaches, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and body aches. Most recover on their own without medical assistance, &lt;a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/west-nile-virus-risk-level-boston-raised-high" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according to Boston health officials&lt;/a&gt;. But, people who are over the age of 50 or immunocompromised are at risk of developing severe illness from West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increased risk level for West Nile virus in Boston is a reminder that protecting yourself and your families from mosquito bites is important,” Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, Boston’s Commissioner of Public Health, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/west-nile-virus-risk-level-boston-raised-high"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Residents should take precautions like using mosquito repellent and avoiding outdoor activities from dusk to dawn.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus isn’t the only mosquito-borne illness public health officials are urging residents to protect against. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/07/23/mosquitos-in-central-mass-town-test-positive-for-eee/"&gt;also been detected&lt;/a&gt; in mosquitoes in the state this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State officials said Belchertown, Bridgewater, Carver, East Bridgewater, Easton, Granby, Halifax, Hanson, Lakeville, Middleborough, Pelham, Plympton, Raynham, Taunton, Ware, and West Bridgewater are considered at moderate risk for EEE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been no confirmed human cases of EEE so far this year. In 2024, there were four human cases, with one fatality, and three animal cases of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both West Nile virus and EEE pose risk to the people in Massachusetts,” Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said in a statement. “The weather remains warm and somewhat humid, which increases mosquito activity. I encourage everyone to take measures to protect themselves: use mosquito repellent when outdoors, wear long sleeves and pants, and be aware of peak mosquito hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to using insect repellent and avoiding peak mosquito biting hours (dusk to dawn), officials are urging residents to take steps to protect their homes and animals by draining standing water and installing or repairing screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents can check the state’s map that &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-arbovirus-update"&gt;tracks the risk&lt;/a&gt; for mosquito-borne illnesses in Massachusetts to determine the risk for EEE and West Nile virus in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Franklin
County officials reported its 10th  confirmed animal rabies case of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;On
Wednesday, staff with Franklin County Animal Services said they have been
working to make sure infected animals are managed safely, and that the
community is aware of positive cases in the area. Officials said they work
closely with Franklin County Health Department to make sure rules for
quarantining and isolation of animals are being closely followed. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We’ve
already doubled the number of confirmed rabies cases in Franklin County this
year, more than all of 2024, and this season is not even close to being over,”
said Scott LaVigne, Franklin County Health Director.   &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Six
of the 10 cases involved skunks, which has been consistent with previous years. Officials said this year has also
included two raccoons, one fox and a bat. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Anyone
that comes into contact with an infected animal or believes they have been
exposed should seek medical attention right away. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Rabies
is nearly 100% fatal in humans once you show symptoms of infection, so we
strictly follow the guidelines,” LaVigne said. “Today, a series of four to five shots is
sufficient to prevent rabies in people.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Pet
owners should also protect their furry loved ones by making sure they are up to
date with their rabies vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;“In
nearly every rabies case this year, where domestic animals were exposed, some
pets had never had a rabies shot,” said Jerry Jones, Interim Animal Services
Manager. “That’s a conversation no one wants to have with a family.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Officials
offered tips to best limit pet’s exposure to rabies:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate your pets against rabies and keep the vaccinations current.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep pets inside. Supervise pets outside and keep dogs on a leash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed pets outside. Pet food and mulch attract wildlife.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed wildlife, feral cats, or feral dogs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secure garbage cans with wildlife-proof lids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL News has a &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/story/avoid-strange-animals-and-other-tips-to-minimize-rabies-risk/17685299/"&gt;guide online&lt;/a&gt; with tips to minimize the risk of rabies. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Officials
advise calling 911 to contact Animal Services if they see any animal showing
rabies symptoms. People should keep a safe distance away from the animal but
watch out for where the animal is until Animal Services Officers arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/franklin-county-tenth-rabies-case-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dogs
and cats are required to have an updated rabies vaccination. If a pet is not
vaccinated or is due for a vaccine, pet owners are advised to contact their
veterinarian. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Franklin
County Animal Shelter is also offering a vaccine event on Saturday, August 23,
from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. The cost for a rabies vaccine is $15. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;For
livestock and other pets, owners should contact their veterinarian for rabies
vaccination information and prevention. &lt;/p&gt;

and growing numbers are being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The findings, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), confirm the wider potential benefits of drug treatment and could help patients decide whether to start medication, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Having ADHD means the brain works differently to most other people's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Symptoms can include difficulties concentrating and sitting still, having high energy levels and being impulsive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Despite the surge in people asking for help, the disorder is not becoming more common. &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c720r1pxrx5o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Last year a BBC investigation found long waits for assessment in the UK.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;People are only diagnosed if the symptoms cause at least a moderate impact on their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The most commonly prescribed drugs, called stimulants, help manage everyday symptoms but there has been limited evidence of longer-term benefits for people's behaviour, while well-publicised side-effects, such as headaches, loss of appetite and trouble sleeping, have sparked debate on their safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This BMJ study was based on 148,500 people aged six to 64, with ADHD in Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some 57% started drug treatment and, of these, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/methylphenidate-adults/side-effects-of-methylphenidate-for-adults/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;methylphenidate (also known as Ritalin)&lt;/a&gt;, was prescribed, to 88%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers, from Southampton University and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, found taking ADHD medication was linked to reductions of first-time instances of:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw"&gt;suicidal behaviour -

diagnose and treat ADHD can lead to self-medication with alcohol or other drugs, poor mental health, injury, and incarceration," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Too many people with undiagnosed ADHD end up in the criminal justice system, where their condition may remain undiagnosed and untreated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ian Maidment, professor in clinical pharmacy at Aston University, said the study "adds to our understanding of the potential benefits of these drugs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, he said the

People with ADHD are also disproportionately represented within the criminal justice system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that for many patients, medication can help alleviate hyperactivity, impulsivity and the inattention. But there has been more limited evidence on whether these improvements translate into benefits in everyday life, at a time when the increasing number of people being diagnosed has fuelled a debate about the possibility of “overdiagnosis”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The number of prescriptions being issued in England for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/11/adhd-prescriptions-in-england-have-risen-by-18-each-year-since-pandemic#:~:text=ADHD%20prescriptions%20in%20England%20have,deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder%20%7C%20The%20Guardian" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has risen by 18% year on year since the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The latest study, which the researchers say is the largest and most rigorous of its kind, used Swedish national registers from 2007 to 2020 to examine the effects of ADHD drug treatment in 148,581 individuals aged six to 64 years with a new diagnosis of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team used a technique called target trial emulation, which aims to apply the design principles of a clinical trial to existing medical records through the use of strict inclusion criteria, follow-up timeframes and the use of statistical techniques to compensate for the fact that people were not randomly assigned to “treatment” or “placebo” arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Zheng Chang, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and senior author of the research, said: “It’s now considered one of the most rigorous methods for analysing observational data. However, since we don’t have the real randomisation data it is not bias-proof.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among people with recurrent events, there were statistically significant reductions linked to all five outcomes, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj-2024-083658" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the paper in the British Medical Journal reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When clinicians discuss the possible use of medication with families, oftentimes there is not a focus on what are the risks if you don’t treat,” said Cortese. “If left untreated, there will be unfortunately some risk. Now we have evidence that medication can reduce this risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Adam Guastella, of the Children’s Hospital Westmead Clinical School at the University of Sydney, said: “Such benefits have been shown repeatedly in previous studies, but the large sample size, use of a national registry, and more sophisticated analysis give greater confidence in these results that findings aren’t explained by something else other than medication use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People should know that if ADHD medications work for them and their child, that there will likely be many other positive impacts on life from treatment. Such effects will not work for everyone and there is still a need to understand why many individuals benefit from ADHD medication and some do not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPRi02SXgwYTl0aE8ydDdTMUMtMHhtV0EzZDJZOVBFQVhrdklOUDdfb09lTWdFamRoUHpBdFhrR1NFZjJaRHJxbVpCcHhoQjJvQlFZeEZzVEVSTmRBYWJHZGhPVXJfSVh2bmt6X0xIUWlDRXNTRkF3NkRHMEVsOHNZOWphcFhhblc0WlRmVFVZNlJGZjI3aWpfQUI4amRXMmZzRFNfaFlVZE90VGtmYTB4MkR5cFAzRmpDbVhqcV9oaw</guid></item><item><title>美国国立卫生研究院以缺乏公众信任为由取消mRNA疫苗合同- The Hill</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNVHpIUU1zZG1YVHpvdF9pcGZOT0MwU0RRWmVmdzJFMG1jZEhlMTRmeVcwOEZTQXFwYW1RSklaNS1rOHE5ZDV6bnBNYm8wOEtUNm5hblF2cTA2dl9ockx1Zy1GZnhHZVk5UU9nUGxvTlpZSmFOekV0Nl9xMmZrMnRnUUNmaWVIZ9IBiwFBVV95cUxPeXlCdnRhNXNJNFViODg2NHY4WHEyUjRXZHgzTUZwQnAyNGkzdlgyXzllbzh2b1RaQU52bnN6c2ZRY2VXa09JSHpLS09IdmxTNjlzM2RDX0tiNXpLdWY2YXlHZTBKMC1HR21ic3JFOU1yQ2lncjR6aVgyV3F6dHR2cW5RTmRnSnRwNDkw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests vegetarians have a 12% lower overall cancer risk compared to those who eat meat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegans saw the greatest benefit, with up to a 24% lower cancer risk overall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The strongest reductions were seen in stomach, lymphoma and colorectal cancers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vegetarian diets, unlike typical Western diets, generally tend to be packed with fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes—all foods loaded with compounds that may help reduce cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While the connection between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cancer-and-how-diet-and-lifestyle-choices-lower-the-risk-8777651" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vegetarian diets and cancer&lt;/a&gt; remains a topic of debate, research on less common cancers is still limited, even in large studies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To help bridge this knowledge gap, researchers explored whether vegetarian diets might offer protection against a wider range of cancer types, not just the more common ones. The study tests the idea that vegetarian diets, compared to nonvegetarian diets, could show &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-to-avoid-to-prevent-cancer-11758515" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protective benefits for less common cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and the results were published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-the-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was the Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study was conducted using data from the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) cohort, which enrolled participants across the United States and Canada between 2002 and 2007. The participants were volunteer members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in North America. Many Seventh-day Adventist members follow a vegetarian or plant-based diet, allowing for a large subject pool of people who follow those dietary patterns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A total of 95,863 participants were part of the study. After excluding participants with preexisting cancers, extreme or unreliable BMI or dietary data, missing demographic information and those living outside areas covered by cancer registries, the final analytic group included 79,468 participants. Enrollment involved completing a detailed questionnaire by mail, which included a validated food frequency questionnaire to assess dietary habits over the previous year. Researchers further validated the data through 24-hour dietary recalls conducted by phone in a subgroup of 1,100 participants and by examining dietary biomarkers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants were categorized into five dietary groups based on their eating habits: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vegans, who avoided all animal products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lacto-ovo-vegetarians, who consumed dairy and/or eggs but no meat or fish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7677248/pescatarian-diet-plan/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pesco-vegetarians&lt;/a&gt;, who included fish in their diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semi-vegetarians, who ate meat or fish less than once a week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nonvegetarians, who consumed meat or fish at least once a week. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the purposes of this study, vegetarians were defined as those in the first three categories, while semi-vegetarians were excluded from the main analysis due to their small numbers and unclear classification. Cancer cases were identified by matching participant data with cancer registries across the United States and Canada.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To ensure the results were as accurate as possible, the study adjusted for various factors that could influence cancer risk, like age, gender and race. For each cancer type, the study included adjustments for relevant risk factors based on existing research and guidelines, ensuring a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between dietary patterns and cancer risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that vegetarians generally had a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/yogurt-colorectal-cancer-study-11682870" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; compared to nonvegetarians, with the exception of a possible slight increase in risk for myeloma. Overall, vegetarians had a 12% lower risk of developing any type of cancer and an 18% lower risk for medium-frequency cancers, such as melanoma, thyroid and pancreatic cancers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For specific cancer types, vegetarians showed significantly lower risks in several areas: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stomach cancer risk was reduced by 45%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lymphoma risk was reduced by 25% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lymphoproliferative cancers risk overall were reduced by 25%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colorectal cancer risk was reduced by 21%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These findings suggest that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8060938/live-longer-fight-climate-change-eat-more-plants/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vegetarian diets may offer protective benefits&lt;/a&gt; against certain types of cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For all cancers combined, vegans had the lowest risk, with a 24% reduction, followed by lacto-ovo-vegetarians with a 9% reduction and pesco-vegetarians with an 11% reduction. For medium-frequency cancers, vegans again had the lowest risk, with a 23% reduction, followed by lacto-ovo-vegetarians with an 18% reduction and pesco-vegetarians with a 13% reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For specific cancers, younger vegans (age 65) had a 43% lower risk of prostate cancer, but this protective effect was not seen in older vegans (age 85). Younger vegans also had a 31% lower risk of breast cancer, while older vegans showed a similar trend, though the results were less precise. For lymphomas, older vegans had a 56% lower risk, while younger vegans showed no significant difference. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has some limitations to consider. One major challenge is the small number of less common cancers, especially among vegans and pesco-vegetarians, which makes it harder to draw strong conclusions. Another limitation is that the nonvegetarian group in this study consists of health-conscious people who already eat less meat than the general population, making it harder to see big differences between groups. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, the study only measured participants’ diets and other factors at the beginning and didn’t track changes over time. Lastly, like all observational studies, there’s always the possibility that other unmeasured factors could influence the results, making it hard to apply these findings to the general population. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on this current study, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7775696/plant-based-diet-for-beginners-your-guide-to-getting-started/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating more plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; can be a practical and potentially powerful way to support your health and lower your risk of certain cancers. While you don’t have to go fully vegan to see benefits, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17189/why-a-vegetarian-diet-is-good-for-your-health-and-the-health-of-the-planet/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;adopting more vegetarian habits&lt;/a&gt; into your diet may make a difference when it comes to cancer risk reduction.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to eat more plants but aren’t sure where to start, here are some simple, practical tips to help you get going:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Small&lt;/strong&gt;: Try one meatless meal a week, like “Meatless Monday.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Plants the Star&lt;/strong&gt;: Build your plate around vegetables, beans or whole grains instead of meat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment with Recipes&lt;/strong&gt;: Try plant-based versions of your favorite dishes, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252610/szechuan-tofu-green-bean-stir-fry/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;veggie stir-fry&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7917086/quick-walnut-tacos/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;walnut tacos&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Up&lt;/strong&gt;: Keep frozen veggies, canned beans and whole grains on hand for quick, easy meals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore Alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;: Try plant-based proteins like tofu, tempeh or chickpeas in place of meat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on the potential health benefits of vegan and vegetarian diets, particularly their association with a lower risk of certain cancers. By analyzing data from over 79,000 participants in the Adventist Health Study-2, researchers found that vegetarians, especially vegans, had a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-start-now-to-reduce-your-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-11748558" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduced risk of cancers like colorectal&lt;/a&gt;, stomach and lymphoma compared to nonvegetarians.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the study has its limitations, such as small sample sizes for less common cancers and the observational nature of the research, the findings suggest that incorporating more plant-based foods into your diet could be a meaningful step toward better health.&lt;br&gt;

To do so, he asked ChatGPT for an alternative to salt, or sodium chloride, to which the AI chatbot suggested sodium bromide, a compound historically used in pharmaceuticals and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the journal noted that doctors were unable to review the original AI chat logs and that the bot likely suggested the substitution for another purpose, such as cleaning, the man purchased sodium bromide and used it in place of table salt for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As a result, he ended up in the ER with paranoid delusions, despite having no history of mental health problems. Convinced that his neighbor was poisoning him, the man was reluctant to even accept water from the hospital, despite reporting extreme thirst. He continued to experience increased paranoia, as well as auditory and visual hallucinations, eventually landing him an involuntary psychiatric hold after he tried to escape during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What was happening to the man?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors determined that the man was suffering from bromide toxicity (or bromism), which can result in neurological and psychiatric symptoms, as well as others experienced by the man, including acne and cherry angiomas (bumps on the skin), fatigue, insomnia, subtle ataxia (clumsiness) and polydipsia (excessive thirst).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other symptoms of bromism can include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, tremors or seizures, drowsiness, headache, weakness, weight loss, kidney damage, respiratory failure and coma, according to &lt;a href="https://www.icliniq.com/articles/vitamins-and-minerals/bromide-toxicity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:iCliniq;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;iCliniq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bromism was once far more common due to bromide salts having been used in everyday products. In the early 20th Century, it was used in over-the-counter medications, often resulting in neuropsychiatric and dermatological symptoms, according to the study's authors. Incidents of such poisoning saw a sharp decline when the Food and Drug Administration phased out the use of bromides in pharmaceuticals between the mid 70s and late 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The man was treated at the hospital for three weeks, over which time his symptoms progressively improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man landed in the hospital after taking dietary advice from ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;USA TODAY reached out to OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, for comment on Wednesday, Aug. 13, but has not received a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The company&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/chatgpt-dietary-advice-sends-man-hospital-dangerous-chemical-poisoning?msockid=1d3f4d70a531614d05ea5edfa428602a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:provided Fox News D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; provided Fox News D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/chatgpt-dietary-advice-sends-man-hospital-dangerous-chemical-poisoning?msockid=1d3f4d70a531614d05ea5edfa428602a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:i;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/chatgpt-dietary-advice-sends-man-hospital-dangerous-chemical-poisoning?msockid=1d3f4d70a531614d05ea5edfa428602a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gital;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;gital&lt;/a&gt; with a statement, saying, "Our terms say that ChatGPT is not intended for use in the treatment of any health condition, and is not a substitute for professional advice.

While the study's authors noted that they couldn't know exactly what the man was told without the original chat log, they did receive a suggestion for bromide as a replacement for chloride in their tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Though the reply stated that context matters, it did not provide a speciﬁc health warning, nor did it inquire about why we wanted to know, as we presume a medical professional would do," said study authors Dr. Audrey Eichenberger, Dr. Stephen Thielke and Dr. Adam Van Buskirk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;AI carries the risk of providing information like this without context, according to the doctors. For example, it is unlikely that a medical expert would have mentioned sodium bromide at all if a patient asked for a salt substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Thus, it is important to consider that ChatGPT and other AI systems can generate scientiﬁc inaccuracies, lack the ability to critically discuss results, and ultimately fuel the spread of misinformation," according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/08/13/man-hospitalized-chat-gpt-diet-advice/85646650007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Man hospitalized after taking ChatGPT diet advice, study says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Man hospitalized after taking ChatGPT diet advice, study says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 21:12:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1NRWpwZWw5OExlbzdMek5McVVPdHMzaWF4ZzJRZHZiaEM3YXVkeDBoMEhJSGZvaDhJRVJpYTdCTGV1enBFTkJ2aXNReEFOOU1KMU0yQXdQX0Rud3RrR0wxT1I2Y3paNHU5WVRKNUVRUWxDZGZhZXdyOQ</guid></item><item><title>在密苏里州证实可能与滑水有关的罕见脑食变形虫感染- CBS新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQV0FpSmlZOGZkQm9ESFFVTUpFWjI0bjdEUWY1MXVHbG04MEg5QU5BbklJMWdXbTBTbmY2NnlRYnVqVllhaWU4cDZHV2NFYUlVYmotQktENFhtTFVNOGVQWUdpbDIySi1QSWRYUE5ONklyYmR3dnRxVmxVU3ZUeUQtVTlTNWRfa2hGUFoxMNIBkgFBVV95cUxPdEkzRkNuMWhveWlQT1pkOGxyOE82cUtpZk11MFJBaW5CT19UMFdQaUliRTljUS15dVJ4WjFuYVZfcks1NGYzTjBaOV91aWlOQkVqZHRGa1JUQzN2NGpSWHhpcWNpaEZKQTJQNGFsMW9pQ2M2TUx3QUlhSHZSeHlBeGo4UF8tenZXTnZieHhHR3hMUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A person in Missouri has been hospitalized after contracting a brain-eating amoeba, possibly after water skiing in the Lake of the Ozarks, state health officials said Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient, who was not identified, is being treated in an intensive care unit for a confirmed Naegleria fowleri amoeba infection, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said. Public health officials are still investigating the source of the infection, but the health department said the patient became ill days after they were at the lake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two public beaches open to visitors at the Lake of the Ozarks State Park, according to the park's website. The health department did not specify which beach the patient had gone to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Naegleria fowleri organism is common in warm freshwater, the infection — called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM — is rare, health officials say. It occurs when water is forced up the nose and is able to cross into the brain, which can happen during &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;recreational freshwater activities&lt;/a&gt;, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1962 and 2024, there have been 167 reported cases of PAM in the United States, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said.&lt;/p&gt;

The South Carolina Department of Public Health said it was the first known case in the state since 2016. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jaysen-carr-south-carolina-brain-eating-amoeba-awareness/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Jaysen Carr's family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; later spoke publicly about their son's death, saying they "do not want this to happen to anyone else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of infection, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; suggests holding your nose or wearing a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into freshwater or keeping your head above water in hot springs. Signs of infection include nausea, vomiting, fever, a severe headache, stiff neck, seizures, altered mental state and hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot get a Naegleria fowleri infection from swallowing contaminated water or from someone else who is infected.&lt;/p&gt;

The test results were discovered on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials warn that rabies is a "deadly disease caused by a virus that can infect all warm-blooded animals, including people." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is spread mostly by wild animals, but unvaccinated cats and dogs may also become infected and spread the virus," officials said. "The rabies virus lives in the saliva and brain tissue of infected animals. Rabies can be spread by scratches from infected animals or when infected saliva comes into contact with open wounds, breaks in the skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.)." &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waterford Animal Control offers the following tips to avoid rabies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refrain from feeding or approaching any wild or stray animals &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your pets up to date on their rabies vaccines &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit your pets unsupervised time outside &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information and questions, contact Ledge Light at the Health District at 860-448-4882, or Waterford Animal Control at 860-442-9451.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 19:24:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPa3hSekR3TWM3dzV2dGktZ04wUmlxa1JaeGtLQlNpY1JrZWd1RmN5ZzFOYUxEaWdWd1ZuNVpPeFFjZEJpN3J5c0FmY3hlZGVoLUM5TEs3cklZSDllc2Y4N3pEWWNSbVc5TUFQSDQzeml5NDVzUkFYV0lYTTk3aDhTdEhEb2V0eDZZdzhrM2tqRVlhUjVxbEHSAbABQVVfeXFMTUdJRUtVcFpTclNwVjlYSVRMLUZoN1c2WExpb0pjVXhXZ3RSM1RqQVhiVTdTQ085LWhMWVU5TERsT2xlLWN5NXAwWldnQkthZWpDM05Qd2tmVWRkX0haUlp0c1pxSy0yT0drWmlPQzJNbGJ3cmtqNEhEMW01Y29tRlp2TU1VcXBUSnVDRXNXNnNLczNnRjdDeFhkU2J4ZVFWMVZ6MnliQUx4a1h1VlQ4bkc</guid></item><item><title>为什么科罗拉多兔子会长出触手和角？ -《丹佛邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE9JQ0h0THFjOFZ1bjNTak5UQ1BKQWZzY1RYMzkxTFBsVUN5em5uOUlSRzlSZHNKWG5WTG9GNE4xWVNpaGZCdVdsdjRhMkRobHdodkpNN0RKMGFTMDJQSF9waVhldnoxR09Menl5TFJfdUhoLU9kVDkzMkJWWdIBgAFBVV95cUxPY19kZ042ZHBfQXc1NEhfWGJsT2piZWRVN2ZEQ241eklKTm9WR0ViRWxwVS1WLXh2bU9SZ2puVTJvVl93YWlDM2EwU1NXcWo4QmduZ3FiM25YRFJBVXl5SldEeWZCWVhKZnZtOGtXUmw2ZE8zdmQyUFVIQkV6M2Uzeg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabbits with tentacles in northern Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s not really a better way to sum up recent photos and headlines about &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/13/science/frankenstein-bunnies-with-head-spikes-invade-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cottontail rabbits spotted around Fort Collins&lt;/a&gt; with long, dangling growths on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as concerning as they appear, the virus that causes the dark, wart-like growths is relatively common and usually not anything to worry about, &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/tag/colorado-parks-and-wildlife/"&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; officials said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growths are caused by &lt;a href="https://cvm.missouri.edu/diseases-of-research-animals-dora/rabbits/rabbit-shope-papilloma-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rabbit or shope papilloma virus&lt;/a&gt;, which is spread between cottontail rabbits through direct contact or biting insects such as fleas and ticks, Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Kara Van Hoose said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shope papilloma virus can’t spread to humans or other pets, although both should avoid rabbits and other wildlife, Van Hoose said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State officials have received a handful of reports of the virus since &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/fort-collins-rabbits-virus/73-a3afc465-4296-4f2b-8491-023d10295661" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Denver’s 9News&lt;/a&gt; published a photo and story of the odd virus last week, which spread to dozens of other local, national and international news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waxy papillomas are mostly made up of keratin and don’t have any negative impact on rabbits unless they interfere with their ability to eat or drink, and most rabbits recover from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabbit papilloma virus can spread to pet rabbits and is more severe in domestic breeds, so pet owners should seek veterinary treatment if their animal gets sick, state officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

The virus is found in cottontail rabbits, especially during summer months, when there is higher rabbit density and insect activity. While CPW has received around a dozen reports of sightings over the last week, Van Hoose speculates that there probably aren’t that many cases of SPV, but rather, many people are likely seeing the same group of infected rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is no risk of virus transmission to humans or other animals, though the CPW recommends that humans and pets should still stay away from and not interact with infected rabbits if they cross paths. However, the CPW also notes that domestic rabbits, if they are housed outside, could contract the virus from infected insects or rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cottontail rabbit with SPV growths, photographed in Minnesota.

A person may be able to spot if this is a problem if they notice the rabbit doesn’t seem able to hop properly, Lindstrom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you find a dead rabbit on your property, regardless of whether it is visibly infected or not, Lindstrom notes that it is safe to wear gloves and handle the animal yourself if you feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 19:08:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxNend2NnQ0T01GR0JETHNOSDA3Z1dHZUdFa0kxdUVpM2M5UWdxeGF5cG5SaFVPSUYwM1gtek5WOG54OGx5b1dfYVBzOUpubXFPY1dCQmRGaG1yUFRNSy1RaEdBdEhHOU5ua04zaEJsX2FnZXpuTzFTVDdYRUlCMHQ3TEo1UWM2ZDMxZWFqNG0xOXYyT2dzV192cnlJYWxRY2czWmhQYWZRV08tOURIQVpiWEI5ZDFEWVRYQlM1amZES0pYOVBhZ3dsT2FGY096SjNBOHp0Z0dWSUJxQQ</guid></item><item><title>40岁的男子说，医生驳回了他患有食管癌的1个迹象- TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPNW5XWTBsOXlJR09Edkp0ckRmYnNiNXB2eVdiUmxZRW5mSndlTHpybDU4cHludURQclJfallkaEpCd2dzQnc3d3dTU1JvT09SNGRfX3pBNGZqM0J0OFJsdWlUYm1ua0lSTEZCRURhVWFrYndkYmwxRjdMOHl4aFlRS2o4WVpLSFVfaWfSAVRBVV95cUxQSE1IZ3FQank1cHgzYVpJd21HMEZtcC1KZEpJcE9uQTFnVkh2LWZ2TFcwdTMwQjBGZlQzTzVCVHZkaHU2Q3ZIT0h5d0I5NlY1dHhvbWU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84b3b6" class="body-graf"&gt;After three stressful years, Mark Sevillano Jr. felt like his life was falling into place. At the start of 2024, he began working out at the gym three days a week and eating healthier foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d628b" class="body-graf"&gt;“I felt better and just when I started feeling better, I … couldn’t really swallow my food comfortably,” the 41-year-old from Santa Fe Springs, California, tells TODAY.com. “I felt like it almost would get stuck in my throat.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-224efc" class="body-graf"&gt;He’d “chug” water, and that often helped the food move through his esophagus. After two months, his symptoms worsened, and he visited a doctor, who reluctantly ordered a swallow test for Sevillano. Before he could undergo the exam, he visited the emergency room, where he learned he had esophageal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8096b" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would have never imagined that I had any cancer, let alone esophageal cancer,” he says. “I’ve never even said the word esophagus. It was not on my radar at all.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-5eed91" class="body-heading"&gt;Transformation Leads to Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c242c" class="body-graf"&gt;In 2021, Sevillano's 11-year marriage ended in divorce, and the dad of two was stressed. At the same time, he was in college completing his teaching degree. By 2024, he had graduated from college and finally began to feel settled as he regularly attended the gym, ate healthy foods and ran a few 5Ks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d472f2" class="body-graf"&gt;“'I’m healing,'” he recalls thinking. “I was losing a little bit of weight, but I thought it was because of my new lifestyle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-013643" class="body-graf"&gt;Soon after, his swallowing problems began. At first, drinking a lot of water helped. But after two months, swallowing became even more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79db28" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would have to literally pound my chest with my fist to help break down the pathway to allow my food to go down,” Sevillano explains. “That was so odd now that I think back on it. But at the time I thought, ‘Oh, I need a little extra help to digest my food.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-3226a1"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="2198"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-07-7de4a1.jpg" alt="His, 39, Doctor Dismissed This 1 Symptom.

But his primary care doctor “didn’t sound too concerned” because Sevillano was young and there was no family history of cancer. Still, Sevillano asked for a swallow test — which his mother, who is a nurse — told him to request. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f197f" class="body-graf"&gt;“He was like, ‘We’ll schedule a swallow test in the future. I’m not too worried about it,’” Sevillano recalls. “Looking back on it, I was like, ‘Wow, there are so many red flags.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-478db3" class="body-graf"&gt;He scheduled the appointment for several months later. But his swallowing “got progressively worse.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32444d" class="body-graf"&gt;“I couldn’t even swallow liquid anymore,” he says. “It would sit in my throat, almost like a drain that is clogged up, and it’s filling up with water. You need to unplug the drain. It felt like that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b66a2" class="body-graf"&gt;Sevillano visited the emergency room and, at first, the doctors were “perplexed” by his swallowing difficulties. But they conducted bloodwork and even had him undergo a CT scan. At about 4 a.m., his blood test results returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-384f1b" class="body-graf"&gt;“(The doctor) said, ‘Hey, to let you know your bloodwork came back great and the next thing we’re waiting on is your scan, and I’m sure that’s going to come back great as well,’” Sevillano recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-98e5a3" class="body-graf"&gt;Less than an hour later, the doctor returned with a grim look on his face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0800c0" class="body-graf"&gt;“He said, ‘Unfortunately, we got your scan back and we found a mass in the center of your chest, in your lower part of your esophagus,’” Sevillano says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a24277" class="body-graf"&gt;At the time, he didn’t realize doctors sometimes interchangeably use mass and tumor, so he wasn’t too worried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa63a7" class="body-graf"&gt;“If he would have said, ‘You have a tumor,’ I would have freaked out a little more,’” Sevillano says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e4a6b" class="body-graf"&gt;He stayed in the hospital to undergo tests, including a biopsy. But when doctors attempted it, they struggled to pass the scope through all the inflammation in his throat. Though they tried a smaller scope, the sample they removed wasn’t enough to determine if it was cancerous. Still, they released Sevillano from the hospital, and he ran a 5K two days later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-399ccd" class="body-graf"&gt;Sevillano's doctors scheduled a second biopsy. But before that happened, he became very ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-501a5f" class="body-graf"&gt;“(This) is where I almost died,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-22fcb5" class="body-graf"&gt;As he waited for the new biopsy and maintained a liquid-only diet, Sevillano became tired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcf6dd" class="body-graf"&gt;“My body just didn’t feel right,” he says. “I started to feel light-headed, almost as if I’m going to faint.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5c647a" class="body-graf"&gt;He rested on the couch and began “convulsing,” and “shaking and shivering.” After he put on a coat and a hat to warm himself up, his mom noticed he was too pale. They returned to the emergency room, where doctors diagnosed him with sepsis, a potentially fatal overreaction in the body to infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70055a" class="body-graf"&gt;“My body was shutting down and they had to pump me with any type of antibiotics to fight the infection that was rapidly going through my bloodstream,” Sevillano says. “For the next four days, I was fighting and trying to get the infection out of my body.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-6625b5"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1708"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/mark-sevillano-esophagael-cancer-mc-250813-05-fa8ac9.jpg" alt="His, 39, Doctor Dismissed This 1 Symptom.

For the most part, chemotherapy caused exhaustion, brain fog and some neuropathy, but after the fourth round, he “started actually vomiting black stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1820a7" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was still awful,” he says. “I took it like a champ. But I think it could have been worse.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad08db" class="body-graf"&gt;Surgery took place in October and was intense. Doctors removed six inches of his esophagus, which is about 10 inches long in total, and a strawberry-sized tumor. Doctors used his upper intestine to create a new esophagus connected to his remaining organ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-002461" class="body-graf"&gt;“I went in with a smile on my face and said, ‘OK, let’s do this. Let’s take this tumor out,’” Sevillano says. “When I woke up, I had maybe eight tubes in my side, in my face. I was in severe pain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-135236" class="body-graf"&gt;After recovering in the hospital for several days and undergoing more tests, Sevillano returned home. About a month later, he underwent one more round of chemotherapy. Doctors recommended that he have another three, but he felt overwhelmed by his prior chemotherapy and treatment and elected to stop. Since his surgery, there has been no evidence of disease. He will undergo regular scans for five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fdd406" class="body-graf"&gt;“I had my six-month check-up scan and that came out with no detection of cancer,” he says. “I went to the beach and celebrated six months of being cancer-free.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-be8da9" class="body-heading"&gt;An Increase in GI Cancers in Young People &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a38087" class="body-graf"&gt;Sevillano is part of a trend of young people being diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancers, which include colorectal, stomach, pancreatic and esophageal cancers. These diagnoses are increasing faster than any other type of cancer in adults under 50, according to a review published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2836671" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46c06a" class="body-graf"&gt;While colorectal cancer cases in young people have increased the most, pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancer diagnoses are also on the rise, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/gastrointestinal-cancers-are-rising-dramatically-people-50-rcna219104" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The latter three do not have a screening test like colorectal cancer does, making them harder to diagnose early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2730a5" class="body-graf"&gt;While more research is needed, the cause of all gastrointestinal cancer in young adults could be the same.

Much like Sevillano’s doctor dismissed his early concerns about swallowing, many young people find their doctors downplaying their concerns because they’re not considering gastrointestinal cancers in people under 50. That could contribute to diagnosis in later stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-89df83" class="body-graf"&gt;“My personal feeing is that it’s because we’re finding them at a more advanced stage because people don’t really think of colon or other GI cancers when they see a young person with these nonspecific complaints,” Dr. Howard Hochster, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey, told NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c81391" class="body-graf"&gt;Though Ng said it’s possible that GI cancers in younger people “may be biologically different and more aggressive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a02dd2" class="body-heading"&gt;‘My Spirit is Not Broken’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4faf32" class="body-graf"&gt;After so many months of not being able to eat normally, Sevillano still struggles with getting enough nutrition.

                        &lt;p&gt;PHOENIX — Arizona wildlife officials are sounding the alarm about potential health risks wild coyotes could pose to domestic animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory testing has confirmed that canine distemper is circulating among coyotes within residential neighborhoods and parks, &lt;a href="https://www.azgfd.com/2025/08/12/canine-distemper-reports-rise-in-maricopa-county/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the Arizona Game and Fish Department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illness is a highly contagious viral disease that infects an animal’s respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems. While humans aren’t vulnerable to it, the disease can be fatal for both domestic and wild animals, especially canids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tuesday announcement from AZGFD said it has been receiving a rising amount of reports of sick or disoriented coyotes within the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to protect dogs from canine distemper from wild coyotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department urges pet owners to keep their animals up-to-date on their vaccinations. Dogs should also be kept on a leash and kept far away from wild animals, especially if they show red flags of canine distemper, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of fear toward humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appearing sick or disoriented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stumbling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seizures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discharge from the eyes and nose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canine temper can spread from wildlife to domestic animals through direct contact, shared food or water sources and airborne droplets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AZGFD urges people to avoid approaching or touching wildlife, refrain from feeding them, supervise pets outdoors and report any sick or dead animals to 623-236-7201.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ktar.com/arizona-news/dog-owners-urged-to-vaccinate-after-valley-sees-distemper-diagnoses/2946916/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Several local nonprofits&lt;/a&gt; operate low-cost clinics that offer distemper vaccines for pets.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; and Prevention estimates that there are 80,000 yearly cases of the vibriosis in the United States, with 52,000 coming from eating contaminated seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Most vibrio infections lead to mild gastroenteritis. Vibrio vulnificus is the variant with the high mortality rate tracked by the Florida Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wound and bloodstream infections of vibrio vulnificus have the severe symptoms, with the bacteria killing one in five people who are infected. Those with pre-existing conditions or recent surgeries are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How many vibrio vulnificus deaths, cases this year?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Aug. 4 incident marks the second death in &lt;a href="/story/news/local/2025/07/31/inspection-report-explains-issues-at-troubled-pcb-marine-park/85422398007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.newsherald.com/story/news/local/2025/07/31/inspection-report-explains-issues-at-troubled-pcb-marine-park/85422398007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bay County&lt;/a&gt; this year from vibrio vulnificus. It also was the Florida's fifth death related to the bacteria this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;So far in 2025, 16 people have contracted vibrio vulnificus across the state. In just Northwest Florida, there was one case in Okaloosa County, one case in Walton County, and two cases in Escambia County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How are most cases contracted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When infections do occur, they typically come from eating raw seafood infected with the virus, or entering water with an open wound. Exposing a wound to raw seafood, such as when shucking an oyster, can also cause an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sanitary sewer overflows, leaky septic tanks, heavy rains, and disturbance of underwater sediment are also linked to higher concentrations of vibrio vulnificus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Rising surface water temperatures from climate change also might allow the bacteria to become more prevalent in colder climates. Cases have been found as far north as New York and Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus thrives in water temperatures between 68 and 95, but can grow in temperatures up to 105, according to the FDOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Panama City News Herald</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 18:41:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQRTk1U1BoallqbDBieE5Ob0xhUVYta2JZNHA3MEtmS0JuNFRlM25iNlZYSUZmSTlKNGpWSHJCZkhJMUhnWUM1OG5aeWlIaWEwQ01jeW0tN2RQV1V6Nng1NExZQ092X1Rrc3JnMXFyLTl3NUhJWE5jb1lwSFBQMExkWUVvUzVjdFp4bXdvMGxCbmM3cG4wNW9PQzhLNlF4M2hKSXhNazdFWXBpSzdEcGFjYlptSlltV1dkRi1LQ1lKSGdNUEhKZmdRNzVhUWhCdw</guid></item><item><title>在Ozarks湖之旅后在密苏里州居民中发现的大脑食用变形虫- KSDK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7AFBVV95cUxOemoxRHVVY3M0NXR5ZHNKbGg0QlA1UzVPRk5JUmdhTml6MTM3SnJraDZSMnYzWHlndUltMFI5R0JQN1FzSlRxQkt1aUxfT29ETndsTGpDcW9mN25zM29DUkgtRkhyMVA1RzlLay1VV2F5SXAtRGxxMGMtLWtxT0ItMFBvaFFFMlZIVk1Jd1k1cmx0d0FESkl4aTQzZlVBcHY1ekFRNUt6TGdubTV5aUhIQm5URC1aUzZVRFN2YXQxNFlPUXdRUHR1dTM2S3RUakNoaWo2ZmFWdFBsNm5SNTdva3B6aFFOWC1Ea0dQTw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The deadly infection has been historically rare, but as climate change heats up waters and worsens flooding, research shows cases could become more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MISSOURI, USA — A Missouri resident is in intensive care after officials confirmed they had contracted a rare and deadly infection after swimming at the Lake of the Ozarks.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

The amoeba can cause a deadly infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is naturally present in warm freshwater and is often found during the summer months, but human infection has historically been extremely rare, health department officials said. There have only been 167 reported cases of the infection in the United States between 1962 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time a Naegleria fowleri infection was &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/news/newsitem/uuid/ea19a071-5c03-495c-9b62-69db69078d4e/missouri-dhss-confirms-case-of-rare-brain-infection#:~:text=Naegleria%2520fowleri%2520is%2520a%2520microscopic,care%2520unit%2520of%2520a%2520hospital." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;confirmed in Missouri was in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The only other confirmed case in the state was in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The source of the patient’s exposure is currently being investigated by public health officials," officials said. "While not confirmed, preliminary information implies the patient may have been water skiing at the Lake of the Ozarks days prior to becoming ill. Recreational water users should assume that &lt;em id="isPasted"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; is present in warm freshwater across the United States; however, infection remains very rare."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other suspected cases of PAM are being investigated in Missouri at this time, according to the department. 5 On Your Side reached out to the Centers for Disease Control for additional comment, but it deferred to Missouri health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Naegleria fowleri infections have historically been rare, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeu.12964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; warns that warming temperatures and increasingly frequent floods caused by human-induced climate change are making infections occur more often.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba thrives in temperatures between 80 and 115 degrees, which is outside the livable range of competing microorganisms, according to&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeu.12964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; research published in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Lakes and rivers are becoming hotter due to climate change, and stronger storms are increasing the amount of organic matter that ends up in the waterways through flooding, creating the perfect storm for Naegleria fowleri populations to spike.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO — The local health department has elevated the risk of contracting West Nile virus to “high” after the city recently recorded three cases of the virus, Chicago’s first human cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The three patients are between 40 and 80 years old, live on the Northwest or South sides and all contracted symptoms in late July or early August, according to a news release from the Chicago Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus spreads only through infected mosquito bites. One in five people develop fever or flu-like symptoms — but most won’t feel sick, according to the health department. One in 150 infected people over 60 years old get severely ill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing a higher proportion of mosquitoes testing positive for West Nile virus than usual this year,” Chicago Public Health Commissioner Olusimbo “Simbo” Ige said in a statement. “The best way to protect yourself from West Nile virus is to avoid mosquito bites and take measures to stop them from breeding around your home.” &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The health department has sprayed insecticide in nine community areas over the last two weeks and will be back at it Wednesday in Forest Glen, Norwood Park, Mount Greenwood and Beverly. On Thursday, it will spray insecticide in East Garfield Park, Near West Side and North Lawndale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The spraying — done from trucks — begins at dusk and runs through 1 a.m. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The health department recommends Chicagoans take caution with Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellant, trimming grass and weeds and dumping away standing water in their yards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chicagoans should also check screens, windows and doors for holes and wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing. People who are immunocompromised should consider staying indoors. &lt;/p&gt;

The company was developing an RNAi-based therapeutic for H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu. RNAi is short for RNA interference and refers to small pieces of RNA that can shut down the production of specific proteins. The approach has been well studied, and several RNAi-based drugs are on the market. The first was approved in 2018 to treat nerve damage caused by a rare disease called hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The contract cancellation came as a surprise to Tiba, which received a stop-work order on August 5 that did not reference the wind-down of BARDA’s mRNA vaccine development activities. “Our project does not involve the development of an mRNA product and is a therapeutic rather than a vaccine,” said Jasdave Chahal, Tiba’s chief scientific officer, via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Government contracts often include specific milestones that contractors must achieve to receive funding and move forward with their projects. Tiba says its project had met its goals so far and was near completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Also among the canceled contracts was a $750,000 award to Emory University to convert an mRNA-based antiviral treatment for flu and Covid into an inhaled, dry powder formulation. The project did not involve the development of a vaccine. “Unfortunately, we don’t have much insight to offer on the grant cancellation,” Emory spokesperson Brian Katzowitz told WIRED in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The cuts are consistent with Kennedy’s desire to deprioritize research into infectious diseases, although &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/06/nx-s1-5493544/rfk-defunding-mrna-vaccine-research"&gt;experts have warned&lt;/a&gt; that the cuts could leave the US more vulnerable to future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Despite its scaling down of RNA-related infectious disease research, the administration has expressed enthusiasm about some non-Covid research involving mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In January, shortly after taking office, President Trump announced a joint venture by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank called Stargate to invest up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure. At the time, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison talked up the potential for AI to make personalized mRNA-based vaccines for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In an &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/12/nih-mrna-vaccines-jay-bhattacharya/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/12/nih-mrna-vaccines-jay-bhattacharya/"}' href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/12/nih-mrna-vaccines-jay-bhattacharya/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;August 12 op-ed&lt;/a&gt; in The Washington Post, National Institutes of Health director Jay Bhattacharya acknowledged the promise of mRNA. “I do not dispute its potential. In the future, it may yet deliver breakthroughs in treating diseases such as cancer, and HHS is continuing to invest in ongoing research on applications in oncology and other complex diseases,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Unlike his boss, Bhattacharya says he does not believe the mRNA vaccines have caused mass harm. But he says the reason for stopping mRNA vaccine research is because the platform has lost public trust—a rationale that deviates from Kennedy’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Yet mRNA may be more accepted when it comes to treating very sick patients with genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Earlier this year, regulators at the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-baby-received-a-custom-crispr-treatment-in-record-time/"&gt;greenlit a customized gene-editing treatment&lt;/a&gt; for an infant named KJ Muldoon with a rare and life-threatening liver disease. Created in just six months, it uses mRNA to deliver the gene-editing components to his liver. It was the first time a customized gene-editing treatment was used to successfully treat a patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In June, FDA commissioner Marty Makary &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/interactive-and-social-media/fda-direct-podcast"&gt;praised the achievement&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a data-offer-url="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fda-direct-this-week-at-the-fda/id1813920000?i=1000711897967" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fda-direct-this-week-at-the-fda/id1813920000?i=1000711897967"}' href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fda-direct-this-week-at-the-fda/id1813920000?i=1000711897967" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;his podcast&lt;/a&gt;, calling it “kind of a big win for medical science,” and at an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/workshops-meetings-conferences-biologics/cell-and-gene-therapy-roundtable-06052025"&gt;FDA roundtable&lt;/a&gt; Makary said the agency will continue to facilitate the regulatory process for these types of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers behind the custom gene-editing treatment plan to use the same approach for more patients and recently met with the FDA about a clinical trial proposal. “The FDA was very positive about the proposal and effectively gave us the green light to proceed with our work,” says Kiran Musunuru, professor for translational research at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The team has another meeting with the FDA in a month or two to discuss extending the platform concept beyond a single disease or single gene to a broader group of disorders. “We’ll see how that goes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 18:07:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPMTdYTE84RFRvcUtKamNmZWhlM1AtWGFQM3k1MFZLMkNybkVILVRIUVZodXFXSGc3VXlGZkJCYXZGdVNkak5FcnV4UjVVTG41RU4yZHRQMDlTXzVCcGxMZVdLT3gxMHppRFVoTWNlSGdKMjZsdEQzOXA3dUVxZ2NLdmFwNi16UGRKV1ZzREpn</guid></item><item><title>并非所有超加工食品都对您有害...研究揭示了实际上使您更健康的八种食物-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNbmhTODVySFozbGNrbUtRODYySjNHVVAzVDlUd1NzNkZfWlpLUTVCQWtwZm9Xb183QjRDTGFjSDJKTDJkZFpERV9VVUtiRU1BMTBIdmpjNWxzT2JaLUpVWUdSdGVGbnN4dHdxVkJIY25SSmdLYUJDUnFITTVSMVgtZnB3cGdTQ0cxazR5MzNKc3BzWHNXaDZBaGJBcHBoZU5sZjQ3cE1EYnZWMVNRb1FZOFRLekVaMTRIalBESUtWZThGSTJoamdDdXkyS092NVVadkNKR9IB2gFBVV95cUxNVEREYnVIb05yTnhUTEh3TlQtNjJPcEtaZ0J3Y3hUYi1GR3lGOGVrbnczUjc5dVFsSzREc2VUcHVuVHVUbTkyY1FyQ210VUl3UklGTDlkczgyVWNNaGFNZUZWZG9LWmpRS2Y3NW1acEpTNjVzcTkzZUV3WXhNczRNTVFFemR1a3JuSlRDeWsySEFlNFU4R3hMZncyeUJvV21leUVfN1pPYWlwREo2emxXS0NkNll4eTlkYmpESVl3OGdXLXU1TGV0ZnBLc2U2bE1Nbjh3eThzMHhPdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-small"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Daily Mail journalists select and curate the products that feature on our site.

They undergo multiple rounds of manufacturing, with factories infusing cheeses, cured meat, potato chips and more with additives that would never be found in the average household kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-056570a0-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; report recently revealed that Americans get &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14977481/americans-half-diet-cancer-causing-foods-report.html"&gt;more than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of their daily calories on average from highly processed foods. Kids and teens got about two-thirds of their calories from these foods from 2021 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UPF-heavy diets have been linked to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13399283/graphic-exactly-ultra-processed-foods-doing-body-including-ruining-skin-hair-depression.html"&gt;a laundry list of maladies&lt;/a&gt;, including obesity, heart disease, colorectal and breast cancers, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-05665b01-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-05665b00-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also determined in April that for every 10 percent more ultra-processed food added to a person's diet, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14655757/researchers-reveal-number-americans-killed-ultraprocessed-foods-us.html"&gt;risk of dying early&lt;/a&gt; from any cause jumped by three percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They further found that one in seven of nearly 1 million premature deaths in the US could be tied directly to ultra-processed foods like meats, candy, ice cream, and even some seemingly healthy salads and breads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But not all ultra-processed foods are the same. Some UPFs, like frozen veggies, canned tomatoes, whole-grain bread, and Greek yogurt, are healthy swaps because their processing, including freezing and canning, preserves nutrients while avoiding risky additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Part of the appeal of UPFs is their accessibility. They are generally cheaper than unprocessed chicken, fresh fruit, and organic vegetables. They help families keep their grocery costs down and get dinner on the table quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts argue that families do not have to sacrifice quality and nutrition for convenience. Canned low-sodium beans, frozen vegetables, and breads with a short ingredients label can be swapped out for some less-than-healthy pantry and freezer staples packed with sodium and preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Foods like pepperoni, chicken nuggets, syrup-packed canned fruit, frozen dinners, candy, store-bought breads, chips, and ice cream are classic ‘red flag’ ultra-processed foods—packed with additives, excess sugar, salt, or unhealthy fats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UPFs are difficult to avoid in the average American grocery store. They make up about 70 percent of the inventories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001365"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;in a study out last week: ‘Most of the foods containing industrial additives are also high in unhealthy fats, added sugars, and salt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Although the additives are part of the issue, the main problem is that children and adults in the United States eat excessive amounts of nutritionally poor UPFs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The term ‘ultra-processed foods’ is an umbrella term that encompasses those items that have been pumped with preservatives, artificial colors, filler ingredients, emulsifiers, sweeteners, and flavoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, not all UPFs are harmful,’ the AHA added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Certain whole grain breads, low-sugar yogurts, tomato sauces, and nut or bean-based spreads are of better diet quality, have been associated with improved health outcomes, and are affordable, allowing possible inclusion in diets.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being ultra-processed, some of the best swaps for what most would consider 'junk food' contain fewer additives, including preservatives and colors, less added sugar, and lower sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frozen veggies and berries, canned tomatoes, whole grain bread, and unsweetened Greek yogurt all qualify as processed foods because they undergo innocuous, and in some cases beneficial, processes. These include flash-freezing, canning, mechanical straining in the case of yogurt, and enrichment with vitamins in whole grain bread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-products-module health two-up" id="mol-7eaeb250-786a-11f0-ad6d-4bfd60e95792"&gt;&lt;div class="ml-ui-list"&gt;&lt;div class="mol-product"&gt;    &lt;div class="mol-product-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freezing vegetables preserves nutrients while avoiding risky additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a class="mol-product-cta wocc" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/45vFm1t"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-product"&gt;    &lt;div class="mol-product-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Certain low-sugar yogurts have been associated with improved health outcomes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a class="mol-product-cta wocc" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/45Nnoc5"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;UPFs typically have long ingredients list including hard-to-pronounce chemicals, artificial colors, and added sugars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above CDC graph shows percentages of calories consumed from ultra-processed foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, most UPFs on store shelves also contain more saturated fat, sodium, and sugar, all red flag ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cured and processed meats such as pepperoni and chicken nuggets, canned fruits in syrup, frozen meals, candies and some breads, potato chips, ice cream, and more, are examples of ‘red flag’ foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Identifying high-risk UPF subgroups is essential to balancing nutritional goals with the need for accessible and appealing food options,’ the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritionists recommend people swap out red flag foods with UPFs that include beneficial ingredients like whole grains, beans, yogurt, or nuts, as well as fortified cereals, whole-grain breads, or plain yogurts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These have been linked to better heart health compared to UPFs loaded with synthetic additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whole grain breads are full of fiber that reduces the risk of colorectal cancer.

said: 'Binge gaming may signify an initial phase in the progression of IDG and other severe social, physical and mental health issues.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they added other risk factors may lead to the development of the disorder like attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study has revealed binge gaming is linked to poor mental health in children and teens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, the latest government figures show 91 per cent of children and young people between three and 15 years old play video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gaming disorder has even been labeled as a health condition by the World Health Organization (WHO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In June, a study found that teens who spend more than two hours a day scrolling on phones or tablets doubled their risk of developing anxiety and quadrupled their chances of becoming depressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prolonged screen time, particularly passively scrolling or ‘doomscrolling’, led to heightened anxiety, depression, aggression and impulsiveness among adolescents who took part in a nine-month study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neuroscientists said 45 per cent of the 12 to 17-year-olds they studied, who had no prior mental health conditions, experienced psychiatric symptoms that needed further medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research comes amid a growing mental health crisis in Britain’s schools, with NHS data showing more than a fifth of eight to 16-year-olds had a probable mental health problem in 2023, a rise of 7 per cent since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13972829/video-games-better-workout-mind-exercise-research-shows.html"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;have found that video gaming can have benefits—with one claiming it can be a better workout for the mind than physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, researchers found gamers scored better on memory, attention and reasoning compared to those who did not play video games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prolonged screen time led to heightened anxiety (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile moderate-level exercise of 150 minutes per week, in line with NHS guidelines, didn't boost memory and thinking skills, despite improving memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13757513/Playing-video-games-BENEFITS-mental-health.html"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;with 97,000 participants found the often misunderstood hobby, gaming, had a positive impact on their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Japanese researchers revealed owning a game console and playing games helped participants improve their wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, participants who played video games for over three hours a day did not enjoy the same benefits, which suggests the problem may lie in binge gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in one study, researchers found those who played video games for three or more benefits a day performed better in cognitive and memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They undergo multiple rounds of manufacturing, with factories infusing cheeses, cured meat, potato chips and more with additives that would never be found in the average household kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-056570a0-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; report recently revealed that Americans get &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14977481/americans-half-diet-cancer-causing-foods-report.html"&gt;more than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of their daily calories on average from highly processed foods. Kids and teens got about two-thirds of their calories from these foods from 2021 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UPF-heavy diets have been linked to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13399283/graphic-exactly-ultra-processed-foods-doing-body-including-ruining-skin-hair-depression.html"&gt;a laundry list of maladies&lt;/a&gt;, including obesity, heart disease, colorectal and breast cancers, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-05665b01-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-05665b00-7856-11f0-9025-f761440c94f5"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also determined in April that for every 10 percent more ultra-processed food added to a person's diet, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14655757/researchers-reveal-number-americans-killed-ultraprocessed-foods-us.html"&gt;risk of dying early&lt;/a&gt; from any cause jumped by three percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They further found that one in seven of nearly 1 million premature deaths in the US could be tied directly to ultra-processed foods like meats, candy, ice cream, and even some seemingly healthy salads and breads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But not all ultra-processed foods are the same. Some UPFs, like frozen veggies, canned tomatoes, whole-grain bread, and Greek yogurt, are healthy swaps because their processing, including freezing and canning, preserves nutrients while avoiding risky additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Part of the appeal of UPFs is their accessibility. They are generally cheaper than unprocessed chicken, fresh fruit, and organic vegetables. They help families keep their grocery costs down and get dinner on the table quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts argue that families do not have to sacrifice quality and nutrition for convenience. Canned low-sodium beans, frozen vegetables, and breads with a short ingredients label can be swapped out for some less-than-healthy pantry and freezer staples packed with sodium and preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Foods like pepperoni, chicken nuggets, syrup-packed canned fruit, frozen dinners, candy, store-bought breads, chips, and ice cream are classic ‘red flag’ ultra-processed foods—packed with additives, excess sugar, salt, or unhealthy fats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UPFs are difficult to avoid in the average American grocery store. They make up about 70 percent of the inventories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001365"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;in a study out last week: ‘Most of the foods containing industrial additives are also high in unhealthy fats, added sugars, and salt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Although the additives are part of the issue, the main problem is that children and adults in the United States eat excessive amounts of nutritionally poor UPFs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The term ‘ultra-processed foods’ is an umbrella term that encompasses those items that have been pumped with preservatives, artificial colors, filler ingredients, emulsifiers, sweeteners, and flavoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, not all UPFs are harmful,’ the AHA added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Certain whole grain breads, low-sugar yogurts, tomato sauces, and nut or bean-based spreads are of better diet quality, have been associated with improved health outcomes, and are affordable, allowing possible inclusion in diets.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being ultra-processed, some of the best swaps for what most would consider 'junk food' contain fewer additives, including preservatives and colors, less added sugar, and lower sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frozen veggies and berries, canned tomatoes, whole grain bread, and unsweetened Greek yogurt all qualify as processed foods because they undergo innocuous, and in some cases beneficial, processes. These include flash-freezing, canning, mechanical straining in the case of yogurt, and enrichment with vitamins in whole grain bread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-products-module health two-up" id="mol-7eaeb250-786a-11f0-ad6d-4bfd60e95792"&gt;&lt;div class="ml-ui-list"&gt;&lt;div class="mol-product"&gt;    &lt;div class="mol-product-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freezing vegetables preserves nutrients while avoiding risky additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a class="mol-product-cta wocc" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/45vFm1t"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-product"&gt;    &lt;div class="mol-product-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Certain low-sugar yogurts have been associated with improved health outcomes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a class="mol-product-cta wocc" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/45Nnoc5"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;UPFs typically have long ingredients list including hard-to-pronounce chemicals, artificial colors, and added sugars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above CDC graph shows percentages of calories consumed from ultra-processed foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, most UPFs on store shelves also contain more saturated fat, sodium, and sugar, all red flag ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cured and processed meats such as pepperoni and chicken nuggets, canned fruits in syrup, frozen meals, candies and some breads, potato chips, ice cream, and more, are examples of ‘red flag’ foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Identifying high-risk UPF subgroups is essential to balancing nutritional goals with the need for accessible and appealing food options,’ the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritionists recommend people swap out red flag foods with UPFs that include beneficial ingredients like whole grains, beans, yogurt, or nuts, as well as fortified cereals, whole-grain breads, or plain yogurts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These have been linked to better heart health compared to UPFs loaded with synthetic additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whole grain breads are full of fiber that reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. Beans and nuts serve as the ideal protein-packed snacks, and unsweetened yogurt balances the body’s gut microbiome and improves overall gastrointestinal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grace Derocha, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.realsimple.com/ultra-processed-foods-that-are-actually-healthy-11788918"&gt;Real Simple&lt;/a&gt;: ‘The science recognizes the complexity—UPF is a broad category, and context matters.

          &lt;p&gt;Health officials in Wyoming are sinking their teeth into a meaty task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 200 people who stayed in a hotel in Grand Teton National Park between May and July may have unknowingly been exposed to rabies, &lt;a href="https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/health/2025-08-12/wyoming-health-department-tracking-down-more-than-200-after-mass-rabies-exposure"&gt;according to Wyoming Public Radio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/wildlife-and-rabies.htm"&gt;an announcement on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, the National Park Service reported finding evidence of a bat colony in the attic. The discovery was made after there had been at least eight incidents in which guests encountered winged mammals inside the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Wyoming Health Department is trying to contact all guests who stayed in a block of rooms under the bat's lair. Specifically, they're reaching out to the over 200 who stayed in rooms 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, and 530 at the Jackson Lake Lodge between May 15 and July 27. It was on July 27 that the eighth bat run-in occurred and the hotel closed the eight rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although there were a lot of people exposed in this incident, one positive about it is that we know who 100 percent of those people are," Travis Riddell, director of the Teton County Public Health Department, told Wyoming Public Radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wyoming, bats are one of the two main carriers of rabies, the other being skunks. But bats are of particular concern because—unlike an extremely obvious skunk attack—people might not be aware of bat exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inconspicuous risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rabies virus generally transmits through saliva via bites and scratches, and bat bites and scratches are easy to miss. The most common bat in Wyoming is the small brown bat, which weighs less than half an ounce on average—though they can look larger due to their wide wings. These teeny bats, with their wee teeth, can leave bites and scratches that are not visible, do not bleed, and are not painful.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                      &lt;p class="ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl"&gt;

The condition can be managed with regular doses of synthetic insulin, but there is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b1cbb62c-60c0-4c46-8f85-845f8b10b0d6"&gt;Islet cell transplants can provide a longer-term supply of insulin for people with type 1 diabetes. However, after receiving a transplant, the patient’s immune system can recognize the new organ as a foreign object, triggering a response that can destroy the transplanted tissue. As a result, transplant patients must take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives, which leaves them susceptible to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these hurdles, scientists in Sweden and the United States transplanted islet cells from a donor's pancreas that had been genetically modified using &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISPR technology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to suppress rejection by the recipient's immune system. This is the first time the treatment has been tested on a human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/crispr-will-provide-cures-for-genetic-diseases-that-were-incurable-before-says-renowned-biochemist-virginijus-siksnys" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/crispr-will-provide-cures-for-genetic-diseases-that-were-incurable-before-says-renowned-biochemist-virginijus-siksnys"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR 'will provide cures for genetic diseases that were incurable before,' says renowned biochemist Virginijus Šikšnys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve weeks after receiving the genetically-modified cells, the transplant recipient has continued to produce insulin without an immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-35NeBdNxRZMDZK4Hk4PjjC" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-35NeBdNxRZMDZK4Hk4PjjC slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their paper, the authors wrote that their study, although preliminary, suggested that genetically engineering transplant cells to evade the recipient's immune system was a valuable tool for avoiding rejection of new cells or organs by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new approach, the researchers used CRISPR to create three changes to the genetic code of the donated cells so that they were less likely to have an immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of these edits reduced the levels of proteins on the surface of the cells that signal to our white blood cells about whether a cell is foreign or not. A third edit boosted production of a protein that discourages attack from other immune cells called CD47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f7f3f0dd-8d98-4cca-9f08-d651dd2b1913"&gt;The genetically edited cells were then injected into the man’s forearm. His body left the modified cells alone and the surviving cells produced insulin as normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the man was given a low dose of the edited cells and will still require daily insulin treatment, the case suggests that the procedure can be done safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ next step is to carry out follow-up studies to find out whether the cells can survive in the long-term, which would make management of the disease easier and potentially provide a cure. They also need to do further tests to determine whether the approach works in other patients.&lt;/p&gt;

Image credit: Pancake Pictures/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research is ongoing regarding when multiple sclerosis develops and strategies for prompt diagnosis. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study found that people who went on to develop multiple sclerosis had a much higher use of medical services up to 15 years prior to multiple sclerosis onset. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results suggest that multiple sclerosis develops earlier than researchers thought in the past, and could help with earlier management of the condition. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study recently published in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="JAMA" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; looked at the use of healthcare services in the 25 years before MS symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compared to a matched cohort of participants without MS, participants with this condition used healthcare services more than their peers in the 15 years before MS onset.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were able to identify specific visit reasons in certain timeframes, with mental health concerns and ill-defined signs and symptoms being some of the earliest problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that MS starts earlier, which may help with diagnosis and early intervention for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this research, experts wanted to learn more about the prodromal phase that may happen in MS, particularly looking at even earlier data than what has been previously studied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in British Columbia, Canada, and researchers used insurance data. They looked at hospital and doctor visits. They used the &lt;a href="https://www.maelstrom-research.org/study/bcms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;British Columbia MS clinical database&lt;/a&gt; to learn when participants first had MS symptoms. Researchers also had access to data on filled prescriptions and population data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were able to look at data from 2,038 participants with MS, as well as a matched cohort of 10,182 participants who did not have MS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After looking at the doctor visit rates each year in the 25 years prior to MS onset, researchers honed in on the 15 years before. This was when changes in health care visits started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 15 years before MS onset, researchers identified more visits from MS participants for ill-defined signs and symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the 14 years before MS onset, researchers identified an increase in doctor visits, doctor visits related to mental health, and injury-related visits. The elevation in mental health visits was significant for most of the 14 years prior to MS onset, with the exception of years 7, 5, and 4. Overall, mental health visits were up 76%. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve years before MS onset, there started to be an increase in psychiatric visits, and this remained significant except in years 6 to 8, and year 4 before MS onset. Overall, the increase in psychiatric consultations was 159%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ophthalmology visits were increased 9 years before MS onset, except at year 6 and year 2, with the highest increase the year right before MS onset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the 8 years before MS continued to be high prior to MS onset except at year 7 and year 5. The greatest spike was in the year right before MS onset. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visits for musculoskeletal-related problems were increased in the five years before MS onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At year four and in the year leading up to MS onset, there was also an increase in visits for nervous system conditions, with a greater increase in the year before MS onset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visits to the emergency room were greater 5 years before MS onset, radiology increased 3 years before, and internal medicine and neurosurgery increased one year before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many healthcare visit upticks peaked in the year right before MS onset. For example, doctor visits and visits for injury, ill-defined signs and symptoms, sensory-organ concerns, and musculoskeletal-related problems peaked in the year before MS onset. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other types of visits were affected in specific years. For example, endocrine visits increased in year 9 prior to the onset of MS. At the same time, visits related to pregnancy and childbirth decreased to a significant level in years 2 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain conditions also had distinct increases prior to MS onset. For example, researchers observed increases in anxiety and depression at years 4, 3 and 2. In the 2 years before MS onset, there was an increase in problems like dizziness and vertigo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year before MS onset, there was an increase in migraines and specific eye problems, such as retinal detachment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data supports the idea that MS may start much sooner than experts previously believed and indicates the need for more research. The authors suggest that psychiatric and mental health concerns may be early features of the prodromal phase of MS, because these concerns started years before increases in visits related to the nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this research did allow for extensive follow-up, there are still limitations. First of all, researchers did not have data on some clinical information details. Instead, they had information on why participants sought out health care services. Second, there is some risk for misclassification or miscoding based on the data researchers used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also challenges of determining MS symptom onset, and researchers note that this “may be influenced by recall bias and challenges with medical history taking.” Some participants had a claim for a demyelinating event or MS before the date designated as the “MS symptom onset date.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible there were some cases of MS that doctors could have diagnosed earlier. It’s also possible that participants in the matched cohort had MS, in spite of evidence against this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data focused on people with MS in British Columbia, Canada, and the majority of participants with MS were female, limiting generalizability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, researchers did not collect data on race or ethnicity, so more data specifying this could be helpful. They only corrected for some factors in the statistical analysis, which could have impacted the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zeydan-burcu-m-d/bio-20200696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Burcu Zeydan&lt;/a&gt;, MD, an assistant professor of neurology at Mayo Clinic, who was not involved in this research noted the following cautions to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see that healthcare visits in the ‘pre-MS diagnosis’ period are mainly for rather nonspecific and/or common causes such as headaches, fatigue, and mental health issues. Since most of these individuals will never develop MS, identification of individuals in a possible MS prodrome carries the risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment as well as a concern for causing unnecessary distress for individuals and families. There is also a possibility of missed opportunities for earlier recognition of MS by clinicians, which is supported by the rise in ophthalmology and neurology visits in the current study as pointed out by the authors. These should be considered in evaluating the MS prodrome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research implies that MS starts earlier and delves into deeper questions about what may cause the condition. Study author Professor &lt;a href="https://tremlettsmsresearchexplained.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Helen Tremlett&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, in the Faculty of Medicine (Neurology) at the University of British Columbia, Canada, explained to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MS may start earlier than we previously thought, and that is actually really important when we think about what causes MS… Our findings suggest we need to look back much further in time than we do, perhaps currently, to avoid thinking that something might cause MS, when, in actual fact, the disease has already started… There’s potential here in the future, not currently, to recognize and perhaps diagnose and manage MS earlier than we can do currently, with the view of course of preventing or slowing progression of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeydan noted that, “using the observations related to MS prodrome, [researchers] should aim to develop individual-level risk models, possibly a scoring system to reliably identify individuals that are at high risk for developing MS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biomarkers (blood and imaging) would be the key to this effort,” she told us. “Perhaps age and sex differences and tools such as AI can help finetune MS risk prediction models,” Zeydan further hypothesized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With a potential future multimodal biomarker panel, if people at high risk can be effectively identified in the MS prodrome, individualized disease screening methods can be implemented into MS care for these high-risk individuals,” she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 16:27:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNUWYwSFJ4RlZ1cGxmNXNiNjVDY0kwQ3pDbXpPd2NmbGRVblR0Z1poLTJ5QUxnbG1CVllvUjVOT19RMnc1UmJhS1NPOG9kd21nQWVuRXRVN0lnYkRCd2I4bDJlUnMxOTJVR3hEYVNOS0RSYmFLbXhWYnNMYnc1QVlZR2tIdzRmdjVGdG5yMHYzNGFyNWxvNjFwYU1XZG55bmEtOFZONUZGQ05wUQ</guid></item><item><title>性忠告：我妻子总是用她的“病情”来摆脱性生活。嗯，现在我知道真相了。-石板</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFBPYTBCLWJPSDh6OHNQMnlManNoM2pUSl9SLVRLVEpVQ3ZhX3h0WmYxZ2lIRWJncnFCS1pLSXFybjhBLURNSmZIcW91MnhmdjhwZENuWEVoY2pOV0tJSVpYVW1hUUpWenMwLXVQYlZpcWZkY1ZrQ0UwYU1B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="28" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmea2sgyy00123b79fkicuxxb@published"&gt;My wife and I have been married for 14 years. When we first got together, she said she had a certain condition, but was in remission at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmea6ekcn003l3b79kzscre4n@published"&gt;She suffered from inflammatory bowel syndrome. Over the years, she has had periodic flare-ups during which we abstained from sexual activity. However, last week, I learned that all these years she has feigned having the illness to have an excuse to avoid sex with me.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmea2sh0e00133b79qc8pxwrl@published"&gt;The proof came when I arrived home from work early and found that she had been eating tortilla chips with hot salsa (she had previously claimed to be unable to eat anything spicy due to her “illness”). When I demanded to know why she had lied to me all this time, her excuse was that she thought it was the only way I would respect her wishes if she wasn’t feeling up to having sex. It really hurts to think that she would feel the need to stage this elaborate ruse because she automatically didn’t think I’d respect her right not to have sex if she didn’t want to. Now I don’t know whether I even want to continue being married to her. Is it possible to get over this sort of deception?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmea2sh4s00163b795mpkw69t@published"&gt;Ah, yes, the old reveal-via-salsa. It’s practically a plot device at this point. Look, the fact of your wife’s deception is understandably upsetting, but I don’t think you’re going to get anywhere without empathy. You need to invest in the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. Why did your wife feel that she needed an excuse to get out of sex with you? Is she generally indirect and non-confrontational? Is there anything you’ve done or in your general tone that could have informed her wariness of giving it to you straight? Did something in her past, perhaps another partner, make her hesitant to turn anyone down for sex?&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmea2sh6800173b79dpkbikcz@published"&gt;Don’t take this so personally. Use it as an opportunity to investigate and get to know your wife on a deeper level. Look beyond the principle of her deception to the root causes. You can immediately tell her that she doesn’t need to invent excuses to refuse sex—she can turn you down at any time, and that’s OK (which absolutely should be the truth, by the way). It seems unlikely that she would devise such a ruse for sport. Involve yourself in the reasons behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

            I know that casual sex and the hookup culture are often considered the norm in college, and many students don’t consider negative consequences beyond pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea1hfpe00003b6nzv2axnnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unfortunately, nearly half (48.2%) of the 2.4 million reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis (all stages) in the United States in the most recent year surveyed were among adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 24 years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexually Transmitted Infections Surveillance, 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001a3b6nkwn2e39d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What I’ve seen in my clinical experience is that teens and young adults often overlook the need for protection against infections, especially when they are using birth control pills or IUDs to prevent pregnancy.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In fact, the &lt;a href="https://www.acha.org/wp-content/uploads/NCHA-IIIb_SPRING_2024_REFERENCE_GROUP_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spring 2024 National College Health Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data shows that only half (50.2%) of the students   who used any method of contraception reported using a male condom the last time they had vaginal intercourse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001b3b6nko8rkegy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a college health doctor, I’m aware that many college students are having sex, and that is clearly their choice. But I’ve seen firsthand how emotionally and physically devastating these diagnoses can be, with tears flooding the exam room from students diagnosed with herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital warts or HIV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001c3b6nuw2ddin7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether the disease is curable or chronic, the emotional toll is often greater than the physical symptoms — especially since many of these sexually transmitted infections could have been prevented.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001d3b6na8eb2jy7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why I want you to know what’s really going on in college and what you can do to keep yourself safe and healthy. This is the no-judgment, real-world talk that everyone deserves to hear before swiping right in college — or anywhere.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001f3b6noqubf17l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, don’t believe everything you hear in your dorm, at the dining hall or at keg-fueled parties. While students will hear that “everyone” is hooking up, that’s not true.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001g3b6n5l6kud8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly 52% percent of college students reported having vaginal intercourse within the last year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.acha.org/wp-content/uploads/NCHA-IIIb_SPRING_2024_REFERENCE_GROUP_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024 American College Health Association National College Health Assessment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That means 48% did not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001i3b6n1lvole45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it’s not all consensual sex. True consent is clear, enthusiastic, ongoing, verbalized, freely given and able to be withdrawn at any time. Students often feel pressured to be more physically intimate to fit in.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001h3b6n5mzyogt4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thirteen percent of undergrads report “nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force or inability to consent,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/AAU-Files/Key-Issues/Campus-Safety/Revised%20Aggregate%20report%20%20and%20appendices%201-7_(01-16-2020_FINAL).pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Association of American Universities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Intoxicated or high individuals cannot give consent, yet many hookups happen under the influence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001j3b6n4gfw0n17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many students have tearfully shared that they “just wanted to get it over with” or chose oral or anal sex to stay a “technical virgin.” Some feel guilt or regret, while others are fully comfortable with their physical intimacy but are shocked by an STI or pregnancy diagnosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001l3b6njjgytuje@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a student comes in concerned about a genital rash, blisters, discharge or pain with urination, STI testing is part of the workup. Students often are selective about which STI tests they want; they’re often fine with checking for chlamydia and gonorrhea but decline HIV testing, because their partner is “not that kind of person.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001m3b6nekc2lykd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the myth persists that these diseases are passed around in other communities (not yours), sexually transmitted infections don’t discriminate. Your risk of an STI comes from behavioral choices, not anyone’s appearance, skin color, culture, religion, values, wealth, sexual orientation or political persuasion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001n3b6njqre91ls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yes, some STIs are more common in certain populations. But check your bias anyway, especially with HIV. Heterosexual contact accounted for 22% of new HIV infections in the United States in 2022, and 13- to 24-year-olds made up 20% of new HIV diagnoses, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIV.gov&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a federal website with information and resources related to HIV/AIDS from the US government. Additionally, young adults are increasingly more fluid in their sexuality, which includes having more bisexual experiences, whether or not they identify as gay or bisexual.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001o3b6nzafzvvb3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you test positive for one STI, you need more testing. Sexually transmitted infections are mostly spread through body fluids, and some are simply shared through direct contact. If you’ve contracted one infection, you may have another, so you should be tested for them. Unfortunately, we frequently diagnose more than one at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001q3b6n0gfdle28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Did you know your partner’s cold sore can become your genital herpes? Cold sores are caused by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;herpes simplex virus type 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or HSV-1, which is easily transmitted by direct contact from one person’s oral area to another person’s genitals. While herpes is probably the most common disease we see passed via oral sex, it’s not the only one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001r3b6ndga6lp48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes and less commonly, HIV, can all be spread bidirectionally from oral-genital intimacy. That means STIs can also cause throat, genital and anal infections. Barriers such as condoms or dental dams can significantly reduce your risk. (This is why flavored condoms exist.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001t3b6np5o5v6uq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most STIs are silent, causing no, fleeting or minimal symptoms, yet capable of causing significant disease in you or your partner. Screening tests are critical to detect asymptomatic bacterial infections early while they can still be easily treated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001u3b6nnh4nvo2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STI in the world, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chlamydia-infection" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pan American Health Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Chlamydia is also the most common bacterial STI in the United States, with more than 1.5 million reported cases per year, and yet chlamydia causes no obvious symptoms in &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.org/news_items/7437-signs-of-chlamydia-and-what-to-do-next" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;most women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (75% of females and 50% of males, according to Scripps Health). Left untreated, &lt;a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/pid/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10% to 15%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of women will develop pelvic inflammatory disease, or PID, and roughly 10% of those women with PID develop infertility, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9129-pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Gonorrhea is the second most common bacterial STI, with more than 600.000 cases in the United States in 2023, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Overview of STIs in 2023.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Although gonorrhea can also cause PID, very often there is a coinfection with chlamydia, ranging from 10% to 40% in some &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK261441/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Institutes of Health studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gonorrhea’s biggest challenge is its growing resistance to antibiotics, making it increasingly difficult to treat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001w3b6n365kdllw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            PID is the most common preventable cause of female infertility in the United States, affecting an estimated 100,000 women per year, &lt;strong&gt;the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9129-pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt; noted&lt;/strong&gt;. Sexually active young women should proactively get tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea each year to protect their future fertility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001x3b6nauyzujwg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Human papillomavirus is the most common STI overall. Although most HPV infections will resolve spontaneously without problems, persistent infections can quickly cause genital warts or, years later, lead to cancer. Because HPV may be transmitted to a person performing oral sex, HPV also causes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/oropharyngeal-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;60% to 70%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the roughly 60,000 oropharyngeal cancers (twice as common in men versus women) diagnosed annually in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001z3b6n9tm73ugd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Human papillomavirus genital warts are not lethal, but they will make you miserable. The treatment is painful, with repeated procedures and a high risk of recurrence. Patients are often scared, embarrassed and emotionally distraught, terrified that this incurable disease will make them undesirable to any future potential partners. I cannot emphasize enough how this emotional burden (which we see with herpes and HIV as well) critically affects students’ self-image, confidence and mental health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00203b6n116iwdin@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since the HPV vaccine rollout, HPV high-risk infections (including genital warts) have fallen by up to 88% among teen girls and young women, thanks to both direct immunization and herd immunity, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/vaccination-impact/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CDC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00213b6ndcnhamy8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients with genital warts used to fill our college clinics, and now thankfully are significantly less common. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40014651/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Impact Monitoring Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  shows that cervical precancers dropped &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40014651/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;roughly 80%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in women ages 20 to 24, and researchers predict HPV vaccination can prevent over 90% of all HPV-related cancers from ever developing, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/about/cancers-caused-by-hpv.html#:~:text=recommended%20screening%20test.-,Recommendations,child's%20doctor%20about%20HPV%20vaccination." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; CDC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00243b6n4fnhk3sz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re going to have sex, be prepared before you have sex. Birth control pills are extremely effective when used correctly, but college life is filled with irregular schedules, late nights, road trip weekends and, for some people — vomiting. If pills are delayed, forgotten, missed or thrown up, the efficacy plummets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00253b6nf3p5emud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adding condoms not only decreases your risk of conception but also adds protection against STIs. Do not, however, double up on condoms. This myth is still perpetuated, but using two condoms at once can increase your risk of breakage and failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00263b6na7cw5t87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Numbers also matter. If you never drive or ride in a car, you’ll never have a car accident. The more you drive, the higher your cumulative risk. It’s math, not morality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00283b6n7tyzb26m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Teens and young adults deserve more than outdated, awkward and judgmental sex talks. They need to learn how to protect their health, their future fertility and their emotional well-being while learning to live life as adults. If more students knew this information, far fewer would end up blindsided in their college medical center’s exam rooms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00293b6ngjnk8txw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hookups may be part of college culture for many students, but let’s normalize being open, prepared and honest about the risks. Check with your university health center to learn more about prevention, screening and treatment.

            I know that casual sex and the hookup culture are often considered the norm in college, and many students don’t consider negative consequences beyond pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea1hfpe00003b6nzv2axnnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unfortunately, nearly half (48.2%) of the 2.4 million reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis (all stages) in the United States in the most recent year surveyed were among adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 24 years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexually Transmitted Infections Surveillance, 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001a3b6nkwn2e39d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What I’ve seen in my clinical experience is that teens and young adults often overlook the need for protection against infections, especially when they are using birth control pills or IUDs to prevent pregnancy.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In fact, the &lt;a href="https://www.acha.org/wp-content/uploads/NCHA-IIIb_SPRING_2024_REFERENCE_GROUP_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spring 2024 National College Health Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data shows that only half (50.2%) of the students   who used any method of contraception reported using a male condom the last time they had vaginal intercourse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001b3b6nko8rkegy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a college health doctor, I’m aware that many college students are having sex, and that is clearly their choice. But I’ve seen firsthand how emotionally and physically devastating these diagnoses can be, with tears flooding the exam room from students diagnosed with herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital warts or HIV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001c3b6nuw2ddin7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether the disease is curable or chronic, the emotional toll is often greater than the physical symptoms — especially since many of these sexually transmitted infections could have been prevented.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001d3b6na8eb2jy7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why I want you to know what’s really going on in college and what you can do to keep yourself safe and healthy. This is the no-judgment, real-world talk that everyone deserves to hear before swiping right in college — or anywhere.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001f3b6noqubf17l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, don’t believe everything you hear in your dorm, at the dining hall or at keg-fueled parties. While students will hear that “everyone” is hooking up, that’s not true.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001g3b6n5l6kud8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly 52% percent of college students reported having vaginal intercourse within the last year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.acha.org/wp-content/uploads/NCHA-IIIb_SPRING_2024_REFERENCE_GROUP_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024 American College Health Association National College Health Assessment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That means 48% did not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001i3b6n1lvole45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it’s not all consensual sex. True consent is clear, enthusiastic, ongoing, verbalized, freely given and able to be withdrawn at any time. Students often feel pressured to be more physically intimate to fit in.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001h3b6n5mzyogt4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thirteen percent of undergrads report “nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force or inability to consent,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/AAU-Files/Key-Issues/Campus-Safety/Revised%20Aggregate%20report%20%20and%20appendices%201-7_(01-16-2020_FINAL).pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Association of American Universities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Intoxicated or high individuals cannot give consent, yet many hookups happen under the influence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001j3b6n4gfw0n17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many students have tearfully shared that they “just wanted to get it over with” or chose oral or anal sex to stay a “technical virgin.” Some feel guilt or regret, while others are fully comfortable with their physical intimacy but are shocked by an STI or pregnancy diagnosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001l3b6njjgytuje@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a student comes in concerned about a genital rash, blisters, discharge or pain with urination, STI testing is part of the workup. Students often are selective about which STI tests they want; they’re often fine with checking for chlamydia and gonorrhea but decline HIV testing, because their partner is “not that kind of person.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001m3b6nekc2lykd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the myth persists that these diseases are passed around in other communities (not yours), sexually transmitted infections don’t discriminate. Your risk of an STI comes from behavioral choices, not anyone’s appearance, skin color, culture, religion, values, wealth, sexual orientation or political persuasion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001n3b6njqre91ls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yes, some STIs are more common in certain populations. But check your bias anyway, especially with HIV. Heterosexual contact accounted for 22% of new HIV infections in the United States in 2022, and 13- to 24-year-olds made up 20% of new HIV diagnoses, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIV.gov&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a federal website with information and resources related to HIV/AIDS from the US government. Additionally, young adults are increasingly more fluid in their sexuality, which includes having more bisexual experiences, whether or not they identify as gay or bisexual.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If you test positive for one STI, you need more testing. Sexually transmitted infections are mostly spread through body fluids, and some are simply shared through direct contact. If you’ve contracted one infection, you may have another, so you should be tested for them. Unfortunately, we frequently diagnose more than one at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Did you know your partner’s cold sore can become your genital herpes? Cold sores are caused by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;herpes simplex virus type 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or HSV-1, which is easily transmitted by direct contact from one person’s oral area to another person’s genitals. While herpes is probably the most common disease we see passed via oral sex, it’s not the only one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001r3b6ndga6lp48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes and less commonly, HIV, can all be spread bidirectionally from oral-genital intimacy. That means STIs can also cause throat, genital and anal infections. Barriers such as condoms or dental dams can significantly reduce your risk. (This is why flavored condoms exist.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001t3b6np5o5v6uq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most STIs are silent, causing no, fleeting or minimal symptoms, yet capable of causing significant disease in you or your partner. Screening tests are critical to detect asymptomatic bacterial infections early while they can still be easily treated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STI in the world, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chlamydia-infection" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pan American Health Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Chlamydia is also the most common bacterial STI in the United States, with more than 1.5 million reported cases per year, and yet chlamydia causes no obvious symptoms in &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.org/news_items/7437-signs-of-chlamydia-and-what-to-do-next" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;most women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (75% of females and 50% of males, according to Scripps Health). Left untreated, &lt;a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/pid/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10% to 15%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of women will develop pelvic inflammatory disease, or PID, and roughly 10% of those women with PID develop infertility, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9129-pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

            Gonorrhea is the second most common bacterial STI, with more than 600.000 cases in the United States in 2023, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Overview of STIs in 2023.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Although gonorrhea can also cause PID, very often there is a coinfection with chlamydia, ranging from 10% to 40% in some &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK261441/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Institutes of Health studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gonorrhea’s biggest challenge is its growing resistance to antibiotics, making it increasingly difficult to treat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu001w3b6n365kdllw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            PID is the most common preventable cause of female infertility in the United States, affecting an estimated 100,000 women per year, &lt;strong&gt;the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9129-pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt; noted&lt;/strong&gt;. Sexually active young women should proactively get tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea each year to protect their future fertility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Human papillomavirus is the most common STI overall. Although most HPV infections will resolve spontaneously without problems, persistent infections can quickly cause genital warts or, years later, lead to cancer. Because HPV may be transmitted to a person performing oral sex, HPV also causes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/oropharyngeal-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;60% to 70%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the roughly 60,000 oropharyngeal cancers (twice as common in men versus women) diagnosed annually in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

            Human papillomavirus genital warts are not lethal, but they will make you miserable. The treatment is painful, with repeated procedures and a high risk of recurrence. Patients are often scared, embarrassed and emotionally distraught, terrified that this incurable disease will make them undesirable to any future potential partners. I cannot emphasize enough how this emotional burden (which we see with herpes and HIV as well) critically affects students’ self-image, confidence and mental health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Since the HPV vaccine rollout, HPV high-risk infections (including genital warts) have fallen by up to 88% among teen girls and young women, thanks to both direct immunization and herd immunity, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/vaccination-impact/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CDC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Patients with genital warts used to fill our college clinics, and now thankfully are significantly less common. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40014651/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Impact Monitoring Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  shows that cervical precancers dropped &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40014651/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;roughly 80%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in women ages 20 to 24, and researchers predict HPV vaccination can prevent over 90% of all HPV-related cancers from ever developing, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/about/cancers-caused-by-hpv.html#:~:text=recommended%20screening%20test.-,Recommendations,child's%20doctor%20about%20HPV%20vaccination." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; CDC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

            If you’re going to have sex, be prepared before you have sex. Birth control pills are extremely effective when used correctly, but college life is filled with irregular schedules, late nights, road trip weekends and, for some people — vomiting. If pills are delayed, forgotten, missed or thrown up, the efficacy plummets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00253b6nf3p5emud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adding condoms not only decreases your risk of conception but also adds protection against STIs. Do not, however, double up on condoms. This myth is still perpetuated, but using two condoms at once can increase your risk of breakage and failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmea2iaqu00263b6na7cw5t87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Numbers also matter. If you never drive or ride in a car, you’ll never have a car accident. The more you drive, the higher your cumulative risk. It’s math, not morality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Teens and young adults deserve more than outdated, awkward and judgmental sex talks. They need to learn how to protect their health, their future fertility and their emotional well-being while learning to live life as adults. If more students knew this information, far fewer would end up blindsided in their college medical center’s exam rooms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Hookups may be part of college culture for many students, but let’s normalize being open, prepared and honest about the risks. Check with your university health center to learn more about prevention, screening and treatment.

Wednesday's Health Report: 20 Louisianians infected with flesh-eating bacteria in 2025; up from past
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="jw_player_wrap"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BATON ROUGE — The number of Louisiana residents infected with a flesh-eating bacteria has increased since the Louisiana Department of Health's last report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/ldh-four-times-as-many-deaths-from-vibrio-vulnificus-in-2025-than-any-other-year-over-last-decade/"&gt;Since July 31,&lt;/a&gt; three additional people have been infected with Vibrio vulnificus, bringing the 2025 total to 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections are higher in 2025 than in any year in the last decade, with the average number of infections in previous years being seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of four people have also died from Vibrio vulnificus, up from the average of one death per year that LDH previously reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No additional deaths have been reported since July 31, LDH added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDH said that Vibrio bacteria can cause illness when an open wound is exposed to coastal waters or when a person eats raw or undercooked seafood, particularly oysters. Symptoms include gastrointestinal illness, wound infection or blood poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDH warns Louisiana residents to remain vigilant about the bacteria, especially for those who have certain medical conditions and treatments that can increase the risk of infection and complications. These include:&lt;br&gt;- Having liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, or thalassemia,&lt;br&gt;- Receiving immune-suppressing therapy for the treatment of a disease,&lt;br&gt;- Taking medicine that decreases stomach acid levels, and&lt;br&gt;- Having had recent stomach surgery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying out of brackish or salt water while having a wound, as well as washing wounds and cuts thoroughly with soap and water if they have been exposed to brackish or salt water, raw seafood or raw seafood juices, is recommended to prevent infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;

Human HT1080, HT29, HeLa and mouse NIH-3T3 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, while CD10-135 cells were provided by collaborators. No further validation was initiated. All cell lines underwent regular testing for mycoplasma infection, and all cell lines were grown in a humidified 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere at 37 °C. HT1080, HT29, HeLa and NIH-3T3 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 41966029), 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin and 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15140122). CD10-135 cells were cultured in DMEM F-12 Nutrient Mixture with Glutamax (DMEM/F12 Glutamax, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10565018) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 41966029), 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin and 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15140122).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec9"&gt;CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene knockout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequences of all guides are provided in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Information&lt;/a&gt;. The plasmid pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Blast (Addgene, 118055), which contains a blasticidin-resistance gene, was used to insert guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting various human genes. The plasmid was linearized using BbsI-HF (NEB, R3539L), and gRNAs targeting the human genes &lt;i&gt;CBS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CTH&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AIFM2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ESR1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FAR1&lt;/i&gt; were inserted (the sequences are provided in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Information&lt;/a&gt;). NEB 5-alpha competent &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (high efficiency, NEB, C2987H) were transformed with plasmids according to the manufacturer’s instructions and colonies were grown overnight over LB agar plates (BD Biosciences, 244520) supplemented with 0.1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ampicillin (Roth, 200-708-1) at 37 °C. Single colonies were picked for plasmid propagation and isolation (Macherey-Nagel, 740410.50). To verify plasmid integrity, the isolated plasmids were digested with SacI-HF (NEB, R3156L) and resolved on 1% agarose gel. Transfection was performed using the Neon NxT electroporation system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NEON1SK), with the electroporation conditions set at 3 pulses of 10 ms at 1,650 V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HT29 cells were electroporated with plasmids carrying gRNAs targeting &lt;i&gt;CBS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CTH&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AIFM2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ESR1&lt;/i&gt;. Selection was initiated 24 h after transfection using 40 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; blasticidin (Invivogen, ant-bl-05) and maintained for 2 weeks. Similarly, HT1080 and CD10 cells were electroporated with plasmids containing gRNAs targeting &lt;i&gt;FAR1&lt;/i&gt;, followed by selection with 20 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 40 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; blasticidin, respectively, starting 24 h after transfection for 2 weeks. Knockout efficiency was verified by western blot in polyclonal cell populations.

After the indicated timepoints, cells were collected and prepared for flow cytometry or western blotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;Flow cytometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were collected and the pellets were washed twice in PBS and stained with 5 μl of 7-AAD (BD Biosciences) and 5 μl of annexin-V–FITC (BD Biosciences) added to 100 μl annexin-V binding buffer solution (BD Biosciences). After 15 min, cells were recorded either on the Fortessa LSRII system with the FACS Diva 6.1.1 software (BD Biosciences), or on the Symphony A3 system with the FAVS Diva v9.0 software (BD Biosciences) and subsequently analysed with the FlowJo v.10 software (Tree Star). The flow cytometry procedure was supported by the Flow Cytometry Core Facility of the CMCB Technology Platform at Technical University of Dresden (TU Dresden) and the FACS Facility of the Institute for Physiological Chemistry (TU Dresden).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Western blotting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were lysed in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA supplemented with PhosSTOP (Merck), cOmplete (Merck) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 30 min, 4 °C). The protein concentration was determined using a commercial BCA assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein (typically 25 μg per lane) were resolved on a 4–15% gradient SDS–PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking for 1 h at room temperature, incubation with primary antibody was performed at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibodies ACSL4 (Abcam, ab155282), GPX4 (Abcam, ab125066), CBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA5-17273), CSE (Proteintech, 60234-1-Ig), POR (Abcam, ab180597), ETHE1 (GeneTex, GTX115707) and SQR (Abcam, ab71978) were diluted 1:1,000 in 5% BSA (Serva, 9048-46-8). Primary antibodies PRX (Abcam, ab184868), AGPS (Invitrogen, A115277), FAR1 (Novus Biological, A107209), FSP1 (provided by M. Conrad, 14D7, or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-377120) and β-actin (Cell Signaling, 3700S) were diluted 1:1,000 in low-fat milk (Roth, 68514-61-4). Secondary antibodies, anti-mouse HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling, 7076S) and anti-rabbit HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling, 7074S), were applied at concentrations of 1:5,000. Proteins were then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Western blot analysis of renal tubules&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For western blot analysis of kidney tubules, freshly isolated tubules are transferred into a 2 ml reaction tube. Depending on the pellet size, an approximate volume of 7 to 30 μl of Roti Load 1 (Roth, K929.1) is added, mixed thoroughly and subsequently snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were then either stored at −80 °C or used directly for the western blot analysis. It is essential to assess the protein loading equivalency, as a classical Bradford assay cannot be conducted. Between 3 and 7 μl of tubules, contingent on the quantity, was loaded onto the gel. Next, Ponceau staining was performed to evaluate the uniformity of protein loading. If the staining results were consistent, the protocol proceeded as previously outlined for cell samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Isolation of primary mouse renal tubules&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary mouse renal tubules were isolated strictly following a recently published protocol&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 43" title="Belavgeni, A., Maremonti, F. &amp;amp; Linkermann, A.

In detail, mouse kidneys were removed, washed with PBS, decapsualized and sliced in four to five slices. Kidney slices of each kidney were transferred into a 2 ml reaction tube containing 2 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; collagenase type II in incubation solution (48 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; trypsin inhibitor, 25 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNase I, 140 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.6 mM K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 1 mM MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 10 mM CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COONa·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 1 mM &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-ketoglutarate and 1.3 mM Ca-gluconate) and digested for 5 min at 37 °C, 850 rpm. Owing to the presence of damaged tubules, the first resulting supernatant was discarded and 1 ml of incubation solution was added to the kidney slices and digested for 5 min at 37 °C, 850 rpm. The supernatant was collected and transferred in a 2 ml reaction tube containing 1 ml ice-cold sorting solution (0.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; bovine albumin in incubation solution). The reaction tubes were left on ice for the tubules to precipitate. The supernatant was removed and the tubules were washed twice with ice-cold incubation solution. Once the tubules precipitated, the supernatant was removed and ice-cold sorting solution was added (the volume was adjusted depending on the number of samples needed for the experiment). Tubules were distributed in a 24-well plate containing DMEM F-12 nutrient mixture without glycine and phenol red (DMEM/F12, custom-made medium provided by Cell Culture Technologies), supplemented with 0.01 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; recombinant human insulin, 5.5 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; human transferrin, 0.005 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; sodium selenite (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and 470 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; linoleic acid (ITS+1, Sigma-Aldrich, I2521), 50 nM hydrocortisone, 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin and 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Investigation of pig kidney tissue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six-month-old INSC94Y (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1, male)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Renner, S. et al.

The kidneys were immediately explanted and further processed for tubule isolation. All of the experiments were performed according to the German Animal Welfare Act with permission from the responsible authority (Government of Upper Bavaria, ROB-55.2-2532.Vet-02-19-195), according to the ARRIVE guidelines and Directive 2010/63/EU. Investigators were strictly blinded to experimental groups during data acquisition and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary porcine renal tubules were isolated using an identical procedure along with the corresponding solutions and media to those described for mouse tubules. Owing to the larger size of the porcine kidney, multiple 2 ml reaction tubes were used during the isolation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Human renal tubules&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human renal tissue for the isolation of renal tubules was obtained from fresh tumour nephrectomy specimens at the University Hospital Dresden. Informed consent was obtained from all patients; ethical approval was granted through the uro-oncological biobanking agreement. All aspects of the declaration of Helsinki were met. After open nephrectomy, tissue was immediately obtained from a non-tumour-infiltrated area. Appropriate sections of the kidney medulla, lacking tumour tissue, were excised from the kidneys by medical professionals. The sections were stored in 50 ml reaction tubes in PBS until they could be sliced into thin sections in the laboratory, following the same protocol used for mouse and porcine tubules. Owing to the size of the sections, up to ten 2 ml tubes were used. The remainder of the protocol was consistent with that used for the isolation of porcine and murine tubules; however, the incubation times for digestion and precipitation were extended to 10 min due to the higher density of human tissue composition, which complicates the sectioning process. Approval for use of nephrectomy samples was granted by the ethics commission of the TU Dresden (EK194092004). Informed consent for use of extant tissue for research purposes was obtained before biopsy. Refusal did not affect clinical care. Investigators were strictly blinded to experimental groups during data acquisition and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Human renal biopsies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the set of human renal biopsies used in this study, we identified samples of patients who underwent renal indication biopsy for mild-to-medium chronic kidney disease of uncertain aetiology at the University Hospital Dresden from 2022 to 2025 that demonstrated minimal chronic tubular injury due to IgA nephritis. Importantly, no other significant comorbidities were present in these patients except for well-controlled hypertension in some cases. The mean ages of the patients were as follows: male (30.25 years), premenopausal female (32.0 years) and postmenopausal female (62.0 years). Fresh biopsy materials were fixed in 4% normal buffered formalin for at least 24 h before embedding in paraffine. After deparaffinization with xylene and rehydration with graded ethanols, unspecific binding was blocked with 3% BSA in PBS and background sniper (50-823-84, Biocare Medical). Subsequently, the primary antibody was incubated at a concentration of 1:5,000 for AGPS (ab236621, Abcam) followed by anti-rabbit secondary antibody (7074S, Cell Signaling). Bound antibody was visualized with a standard polymer horseradish peroxidase system and counterstained with haematoxylin. Stained sections were analysed using the Axio Imager microscope (Zeiss) or Zeiss Observer Z.1 at ×100, ×200 and ×400 magnification. Micrographs were digitalized using an AxioCam MRm Rev. 3 FireWire camera and AxioVision v.4.5 software (Zeiss), or using an AxioCam MRc and Zen 2012 Software (Zeiss), respectively. Semiquantative scoring of the immunohistochemistry staining intensity (ranging from 0 to 3) in the brush border compartment of proximal tubules was performed by an experienced nephropathologist in a strictly double-blinded manner. Approval for use of human renal biopsies was granted by the ethics commission of the TU Dresden (EK 148052012 and BOK-EK-431102023). Informed consent for use of extant tissue for research purposes was obtained before biopsy. Refusal did not affect clinical care.

No more than 10% LDH release in these negative controls was tolerated as a quality control. Freshly isolated mouse renal tubules were placed in 24-well plates in DMEM/F12 nutrient mixture without glycine and phenol red (DMEM/F12, custom-made medium provided by Cell Culture Technologies), supplemented with 0.01 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; recombinant human insulin, 5.5 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; human transferrin, 0.005 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 470 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; linoleic acid (ITS + 1, Sigma-Aldrich, I2521), 50 nM hydrocortisone, 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin, and 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The comparison of male and female mouse tubules was performed using a ×2.5/0.3 EC Plan Neofluar objective, while the tubules were plated in a custom-made 3D chamber. An Axiovert 200M or a Zeiss Observer Z.1, both equipped with a large incubation chamber (37 °C), 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and humidity control were used for all of the live imaging experiments. Transmitted light and fluorescence images (GFP BP filter cube, RFP double filter cube) were acquired using an Orca flash 4.0 camera (Axiovert) or an Axiocam 506 colour (Zeiss Observer Z.1). The live imaging procedure was supported by the Light Microscopy Facility, a Core Facility of the CMCB Technology Platform at Technical University of Dresden (TU Dresden), and the CFCI Core Facility Cellular Imaging (TU Dresden).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Quantification of SYTOX positivity in freshly isolated renal tubules&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolated renal tubules from male or female mice were incubated in a single 3D-printed well separated by a glass slide, stained with SYTOX green nucleic acid stain.

Every 30 min, the images were assessed for the number of tubules exhibiting more than 90% of SYTOX green positivity. For the quantification of cell death propagation, tubules with less than 90% SYTOX positivity were not counted. Debris was not included in the analysis.

In brief, to induce &lt;i&gt;Gpx4&lt;/i&gt; deletion, tamoxifen was first dissolved in Miglyol at a concentration of 20 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (Tamoxifen, Sigma-Aldrich, T5648-1G; Miglyol, Caelo 3274-250mL), whereupon 100 μl was injected intraperitoneally on days 0 and 2. To detect potential gender-specific differences in survival time, the mice were monitored daily and euthanized by cervical dislocation after presenting with symptoms of acute kidney failure (humane end point). For the end-point study, mice were again injected with tamoxifen twice, and serum and kidneys were collected at day 10. All animals were bred and maintained under standard specific-pathogen free + individually ventilated cage conditions with food and water ab libitum and all studies were approved by the government of Upper Bavaria (Regierung von Oberbayern, Germany: ROB-55.2-2532.Vet_02-20-51).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;Bilateral kidney IRI injury model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All male and female mice were strictly matched for weight, age and genetic background. Bilateral kidney IRI was performed as described in detail previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 43" title="Belavgeni, A., Maremonti, F. &amp;amp; Linkermann, A. Protocol for isolating murine kidney tubules and ex vivo cell death assays. STAR Protoc. 5, 103005 (2024)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#ref-CR43" id="ref-link-section-d124332778e3540"&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In essence, 30 min before anaesthesia, mice received a single intraperitoneal dose of a ferrostatin (Fer-1 (10 mg per kg at 200 µl), UAMC-2303 (200 µl 2.5 mM solution in 0.9% NaCl), or 2OH-oestradiol (10 mg per kg, 200 µl) or a corresponding vehicle control as indicated. Then, 15 min before surgery, all mice received 0.1 µg per g body weight buprenorphine-HCl for analgesia. Anaesthesia was induced by the application of 3 l min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of volatile isoflurane with pure oxygen in the induction chamber of a COMPAC5 (VetEquip) small animal anaesthesia unit. After achieving a sufficient level of narcosis, typically within 2 min, mice were placed in a supine position on a temperature-controlled self-regulated heating system calibrated to 38 °C and fixed with stripes at all extremities. Anaesthesia was reduced to a maintenance dose of 1.5 l min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; isoflurane. Breathing characteristics and levels of analgesia were closely assessed visually. The abdomen was opened layer-by-layer to create a 2 cm wide opening. Blunt retractors (Fine Science Tools (FST)) were placed for convenient access. With the use of a surgical microscope (Carl Zeiss), sharp forceps were used to pinch retroperitoneal holes directly cranially and caudally in the renal pedicles. Using this access, a 100 g pressure micro serrefine (FST, 18055-03) was placed onto each pedicle to induce ischaemia. Time difference between the placement of both serrefines was recorded (typically &amp;lt;40 s, controlled in all cases to under 1:00 min), the gut was returned into the abdominal cavity and the opening was covered with the two gauze pieces. Then, 1 min before ending of target ischaemia time, the renal pedicles were visualized again and clamps removed exactly at the indicated times (1 s tolerance). The parietal peritoneum and the cutis, respectively, were closed separately by continuous seams using a 6-0 monocryl thread (Ethicon). Isoflurane application was stopped immediately thereafter and 1 ml of prewarmed PBS was administered intraperitoneally to compensate for any possible dehydration during surgery and to control for potential leakiness of the seams. The mice were divided into pairs of two and put back into the cages. 0.1 µg per g buprenorphine-HCl was administered every 8 h for analgesia. After a 48 h observation period, blood was collected by retroorbital puncture and the mice were euthanized by neck dislocation. The right kidney was removed to be fixed for 24 h in 4% normal buffered formalin and transferred to 70% ethanol for storage at room temperature. The left kidney was removed and shock frozen in liquid nitrogen before transfer to −80 °C for storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we applied different doses of ischaemia. For male mice, we defined 36 min as a hard ischaemia dose (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig1"&gt;1a,b&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig2"&gt;2j–m&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig10"&gt;5g,h&lt;/a&gt;). For female mice, three different doses were used from a titration experiment (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig6"&gt;1f–i&lt;/a&gt;) defining a medium ischaemia dose of 36 min (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig2"&gt;2k–j,n–q&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig3"&gt;3p–r&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig6"&gt;1b–e&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig10"&gt;5i&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig13"&gt;8c&lt;/a&gt;). A light ischaemia was defined as 30 min, whereas a hard ischaemia was set at 45 min (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig1"&gt;1i–l&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig4"&gt;4c–f&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig6"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#Fig14"&gt;9a–d&lt;/a&gt;). Inhibitors and vehicle solution were freshly prepared and put on ice until use in a blinded manner. UAMC-3203 was applied intraperitoneally 15 min before surgery in 2.5 mM with 0.9% NaCl in a final volume of 200 µl, Fer-1 was applied intraperitoneally 15 min before surgery (5 mg per kg) in a 200 µl final volume and 2OH-E2 (10 mg per kg) in a 200 µl final volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effect of ferrostatins in different doses of ischaemia, either vehicle or UAMC-3203 was applied 15 min before surgery as described above to 10-week-old C57BL/6N female wild-type mice. Surgery was performed as described above with ischaemia times escalating from 30 min to 45 min. After 48 h, blood was taken and the kidneys were removed and processed as described above (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09389-x#MOESM1"&gt;2j–l&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All IRI experiments were approved by the government of Saxony (Landesdirektion Sachsen, Germany; TVV 07/2021 and TVV 38/2024).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;Ovariectomy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ovariectomy was performed using an abdominal approach. At 15 min before surgery, all mice received 0.1 µg per g body weight buprenorphine-HCl for analgesia. Anaesthesia was induced by the application of volatile isoflurane with pure oxygen in the induction chamber of the COMPAC5 (VetEquip) small animal anaesthesia unit. After achieving a sufficient level of narcosis, typically within 2 min, mice were placed in a supine position on a temperature-controlled self-regulated heating system calibrated to 38 °C and fixed with stripes at all extremities. Surgical access to the abdominal cavity was created in the lower abdomen and the right ovary was visualized first. After ligation of the blood supply, the ovary was removed; the same procedure was applied to the left ovary. Next, the abdomen was closed layer by layer and the mice were set back into the individually ventilated cage in pairs. Then, 7 days later, IRI surgery was performed as described above partially using the previous abdominal access. Ovariectomies were approved by the government of Saxony (Landesdirektion Sachsen, Germany; TVV 38/2024).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec37"&gt;Histology&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organs were dissected as indicated in each experiment and put in 4% (v/v) neutral-buffered formaldehyde, fixated for 24 h and then transferred to 70% ethanol for storage. In general, the kidneys were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and xylene, and finally embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (3–5 μm) were stained with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reagent, according to a standard routine protocol. The stained sections were analysed using the Axio Imager microscope (Zeiss) or Zeiss Observer Z.1 at ×100, ×200 and ×400 magnification. Micrographs were digitalized using an AxioCam MRm Rev. 3 FireWire camera and AxioVision v.4.5 software (Zeiss), or using an AxioCam MRc and Zen 2012 Software (Zeiss), respectively. Organ damage was quantified by two experienced pathologists in a double-blinded manner on a scale ranging from 0 (unaffected tissue) to 10 (most severe organ damage). For the scoring system, tissues were stained with PAS, and the degree of morphological involvement in renal failure was determined using light microscopy. The following parameters were chosen as indicative of morphological damage to the kidney after IRI: brush border loss, red blood cell extravasation, tubule dilatation, tubule degeneration, tubule necrosis and tubular cast formation. These parameters were evaluated on a scale of 0–10, which ranged from not present (0), mild (1–4), moderate (5 or 6), severe (7 or 8), to very severe (9 or 10). Each parameter was determined on at least five different animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;Software for illustrations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illustrations were created using Affinity Designer 2.6, Affinity Photo 2.6 (Serif), Prism v.10.5.0 and Adobe Illustrator v.26.0.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 10 (GraphPad).

Rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, are being spotted with eerie black-colored growths resembling tentacles or &lt;a href="/topic/horns"&gt;horns&lt;/a&gt; protruding from their heads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9NEWS Northern Colorado reporter Amanda Gilbert captured &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/fort-collins-rabbits-virus/73-a3afc465-4296-4f2b-8491-023d10295661"&gt;a photo&lt;/a&gt; of one not-so-cute rabbit with the growth on its head, which resident Susan Mansfield said looked like “black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around his or her mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought he would die off during the winter, but he didn’t. He came back a second year, and it grew,” Mansfield added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photos of another rabbit, whose growths have almost completely covered its face, have also gone &lt;a href="/topic/viral"&gt;viral&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1mp23qk/rabbits_in_colorado_spotted_with_tentaclelike/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials have identified the cause as shope papillomavirus, a rabbit-only &lt;a href="/topic/virus"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; with no cure that produces wart-like &lt;a href="/topic/tumours"&gt;tumours&lt;/a&gt; known as papillomas, particularly around the face and head of cottontail rabbits, 9NEWS reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 fvWUBn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/13/14/43/Untitled-design.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/13/14/43/Untitled-design.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/13/14/43/Untitled-design.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Rabbits in Colorado have been spotted with horns and gross tentacles causing concern among residents." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-11385"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Rabbits in Colorado have been spotted with horns and gross tentacles causing concern among residents.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Clinton Forry via Flickr, CC-by-2.0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus only spreads among rabbits, primarily by biting insects like fleas and ticks during warmer months. A relative of human papillomavirus, SPV is not harmful to humans, pets or other wildlife, and usually doesn’t hurt the rabbit unless it affects the eyes or mouth, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials advise residents to avoid approaching or touching affected rabbits. Most wild rabbits manage well, as the growths often disappear on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rabbits’ eerie look has gone viral, with comparisons to “&lt;a href="/topic/zombies"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;,” “aliens, and “Frankenstein bunnies.” Their antler-like growths may have inspired the North American jackalope legend, some researchers and folklorists say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kEhyLN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/13/14/46/SPVrabbit-960x640.webp" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/13/14/46/SPVrabbit-960x640.webp?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/13/14/46/SPVrabbit-960x640.webp?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Officials advise residents to avoid approaching or touching affected rabbits." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-11386"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Officials advise residents to avoid approaching or touching affected rabbits.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Clinton Forry via Flickr, CC-by-2.0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wow, I kinda feel bad for them,” one person commented on an &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNR0agaND8l/?img_index=1"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; of the affected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One time I need this to be AI,” another joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zombies are on the rise,” someone else added on &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/complex/posts/1267866944979693"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rabbit escaped from ‘Monty Python and The Holy Grail,’” another person referenced the cult-classic movie’s killer rabbit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOMDRjUHJ2aE4zb3d4M1pDR1dsUnQ0ejlIZnF3MjlmWlo1Y2hXY0dMQ2stS3lzbGpqR1l2ZnRseElvWS1NOHpROFhJNHFuN216aE9OOEVpdkp6Z0tTSkVsWkNlTWtQeUY3SWV1ZlJxZ3NONWZvZE5odVZDS0Rzem1qS29laHd5bG5VNVUwUXoxaFJmZmdMUW41Zm1WTUZEQkE</guid></item><item><title>全国范围内的自然实验将建筑环境与体育活动联系起来-自然</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE96TlM5bk1JN1hLNlZSeWJxX1F1RE82ajhaV0RFRVhTTF9IbjRkcUxLMFdKem90RjZEMFptZVEzcFpuOGM3X0ZIREEwZUp6NGQ1U2N0S1N1VkVDZkUtZEtz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec7-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec8"&gt;Study design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a countrywide, prospective, longitudinal physical activity study of US residents that evaluated their physical activity levels within the context of the walkability of their built environments before and after relocation (‘participants’).

Participants were excluded from a particular analysis if necessary information was unreported (for example, participants with no reported age were excluded from the analysis of Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig2"&gt;2b&lt;/a&gt;).

Anonymized Azumio Argus app data was obtained through a Data Use Agreement. Data handling and analysis was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Stanford University Institutional Review Board, which deemed this study exempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For population size statistics, refer to Extended Data Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Tab1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Tab3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec9"&gt;Statistical methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All error bars throughout this paper correspond to bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. When these bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals do not include the null value (typically 0), they indicate a statistically significant difference at the &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05 level. All statistical hypothesis tests were two-sided Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests unless indicated otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec10"&gt;Identifying participant relocation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We defined participant relocation as the action of moving to a new place for a substantial amount of time. We identified participant relocation as follows. Participant location on a given day was assigned to a city based on the weather update in the participant’s app activity feed. Weather updates are automatically added to the feed of each participant according to the nearest cell phone tower. We searched for participants that stayed in one location within a 100-km radius for at least 14 days and then moved to a different location that was at least 100 km away. Participants were required to stay within a 100-km radius of this new location for at least another 14 days. The 14-day threshold was chosen to filter out short trips that may be related to business or leisure travel. Using this threshold, we find that most participants do not relocate again and spend a median of 81 days in the new location, effectively excluding the impact of short-term travel on our analyses. Most participants stopped tracking their activity at this time, rather than relocating again. In addition, we repeated our analyses with thresholds of 21 and 30 days and found highly consistent results (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig9"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). We required a substantial move distance (100 km or more) to ensure that relocating participants were exposed to a new built environment. We allowed for up to 5 days of intermediate travel between these two locations and ignored these days during analyses. We applied this method to 2,112,288 users of the Argus smartphone app and identified 31,034 relocations. Among these, we required participants to have used the app to track their physical activity for at least 10 days within the 30 days before and after their relocation (as in previous work&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Althoff, T. et al.

We further required at least 1 day of tracked physical activity before and after relocation to ensure that, whenever we compare two participant populations, these populations are identical and therefore comparable (that is, we seek to identify within-participant changes in physical activity). We repeated our statistical analyses with alternative data inclusion criteria, such as the number of days with tracked physical activity, and found similar results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Physical activity measure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our device-based (historically often called objective) measure of physical activity was the number of steps over time recorded by the participant’s smartphone. Steps were determined based on the smartphone accelerometers and the manufacturer’s proprietary algorithms for step counting. The Azumio Argus app records step measurements on a minute-by-minute basis. These measurements are collected passively without requiring the smartphone or Azumio Argus app to be in active use.

Owing to the approximately linear nature of the relationship between walkability changes and physical activity changes (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;), we used a linear model for estimation. For each subgroup, we ran independent linear regressions of the difference in daily steps on differences in walkability between cities at the level of individual relocations. The models included an intercept coefficient: &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="stix"&gt;⋅&lt;/span&gt; Δ + &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;. We determined the estimated coefficient of walkability (&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;; that is, the increase in daily steps for each one-point increase in walkability of a city) along with 95% confidence intervals (based on Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-distribution) for each subgroup (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig2"&gt;2b&lt;/a&gt;). We performed Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests on the regression model coefficients, which establish that relocation to a city of higher walkability is associated with significantly more daily steps across all age, gender, BMI and activity level groups (Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test; all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), with the exception of women over 50 years old, for which the positive difference was not statistically significant (Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.14). We found that the effect was diminished in overweight and obese women relative to normal-weight women. Thus, the non-significant effect on women over 50 years of age may be explained, in part, by the larger average BMI of this group (27.4) compared with other women (25.3; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;). In comparison, men over 50 years of age also had a larger BMI compared with other men, but the difference was smaller than in women (28.2 versus 27.0; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Adjusting for seasonality&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is influenced by climate and weather&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 84" title="Tucker, P. &amp;amp; Gilliland, J.

We found that differences in physical activity levels following relocations may be influenced by seasonal variation, especially when considering comparatively long observation periods of about 6 months (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#MOESM1"&gt;3b,c&lt;/a&gt;).

With respect to this possibility, note that we found no indication of increases in physical activity after moving to a location of similar walkability (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig3"&gt;3c&lt;/a&gt;). This suggests that those relocating participants are not simply more motivated to exercise, on average, but that changes in physical activity may be explained by the changing built environment. It is possible that selection effects were absent because participants may not have perceived themselves as being observed, in contrast to previous studies that featured explicit, short periods of monitoring (Hawthorne effect). We further acknowledge that other city characteristics may affect walking and be correlated with the city’s walkability (for example, length of work days). We investigated potential selection effects further by comparing the population of relocating mobile app users, first, to the overall US population, and, second, to the overall mobile app user population, including non-relocating app users. We found that the relocating participant population is similar in age (36 versus 37.7 years median age) and gender (49.8% versus 51.0% female, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.132; Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test) to the US population (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig6"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). We adjusted for differences in age for the simulation estimates in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig3"&gt;3f&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig4"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. Within the app user population, we found that movers and non-movers (that is, relocating and non-relocating participants) tend to be close in age (43.8 versus 37.9 and 38.5 versus 33.7 average age for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig7"&gt;4a,b&lt;/a&gt;), and weight status (68.1% versus 59.8% and 45.6% versus 44.3% overweight and obese for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig7"&gt;4c,d&lt;/a&gt;). However, movers were generally more physically active than non-movers (6,284 versus 5,825 and 5,279 versus 4,635 average daily steps for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig7"&gt;4e,f&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, we found that within movers, those that relocate to higher-, similar- and lower-walkability locations were similar in age, weight status and previous physical activity levels (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig8"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Simulating the impact of walkability improvements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We simulated the impact of US nationwide walkability improvements on US population physical activity levels. Concretely, we simulated the impact of increasing US city walkability scores to a constant target walkability score between 1 and 100. We also highlight the walkability scores of Chicago and Philadelphia (78) as well as New York City (89) to aid interpretation. As the relocation population was not explicitly drawn to be representative of the US population, we adjusted our estimates through ratio-based post-stratification weights across age-based strata&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 86" title="Bethlehem, J.

We used civilian population estimates from the US Census Bureau for 2016 as the target population distribution. While there were no significant differences in the gender distribution (49.8% female versus 51.0% female, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.132; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig6"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;), we found slight differences in age (36.0 versus 37.7 years median age; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#Fig6"&gt;3b&lt;/a&gt;), which we corrected for through sampling weights. We acknowledge that other selection effects and heterogeneous treatment effects may exist. Using a bootstrap with 1,000 replications, we estimated the difference in the overall US population that would meet US national aerobic physical activity guidelines for MVPA&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09321-3#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d77489268e1796"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; after relocating based on the relocation-induced difference in walkability. We used a linear regression model and data from relocations associated with both walkability increases and decreases. We estimated the total fraction of US population meeting aerobic physical activity guidelines as the sum between the fraction of people already meeting these guidelines before relocating plus the estimated addition based on the regression model.

                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;NIH-supported trial finds dalbavancin safe, effective for treating bacteremia &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported clinical trial has found that the outcome of treating complicated &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; bloodstream infections with two intravenous (IV) doses of the antibiotic dalbavancin seven days apart is just as good as daily IV doses of conventional antibiotics over four to six weeks. Nearly 120,000 &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bloodstream infections and 20,000 associated deaths occurred in the United States in 2017. The study results provide the clearest evidence to date for the safety and effectiveness of dalbavancin therapy for complicated &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bloodstream infections, expanding the number of antimicrobial treatment options for clinicians and patients. The findings were published today in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Given the small number of antimicrobial drugs available to treat &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus &lt;/em&gt;bloodstream infections&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the bacteria’s growing drug resistance, establishing dalbavancin as a beneficial therapy for these severe infections gives us a vital new alternative to treat them,” said John Beigel, M.D., the acting director of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which sponsored and funded the trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standard therapy for complicated &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; bloodstream infections, or bacteremia, typically involves inserting a long IV line known as a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) into a vein, usually in the arm, to deliver antibiotics through the blood for many weeks. The PICC line remains in place for the full duration of treatment, and people with a PICC line have many limitations on their activity to avoid damaging the line. Its long-term presence and use can lead to complications such as blood clots and additional infections. By contrast, dalbavancin therapy requires temporarily inserting a short catheter into a vein in the hand or arm twice for only an hour at a time. Given these differences, the investigators who designed the trial hypothesized that study participants who received dalbavancin therapy would have fewer side effects, higher rates of treatment completion, and a better quality of life than those who received standard therapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Phase 2b trial enrolled 200 hospitalized adults with complicated &lt;em&gt;S. aureus &lt;/em&gt;bacteremia at 23 medical centers in the United States and Canada from 2021 to 2023. The participants initially received three to 10 days of preliminary treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, had no fever, and lacked detectable &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; in their blood when it was cultured in a laboratory. The bacteria could still be present below the limit of detection, however. For study purposes, complicated bacteremia was defined as any case not meeting criteria for uncomplicated bacteremia according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America’s 2011 guidelines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants were assigned at random to receive either dalbavancin 1500 mg intravenously on days one and eight, or standard therapy for four to eight weeks. The antibiotics used as standard therapy were cefazolin or an anti-Staphylococcal penicillin for methicillin-susceptible &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; and vancomycin or daptomycin for methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA), with the amount and frequency of dosing determined by each study site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study team evaluated the likelihood that a participant randomly selected from the dalbavancin group would have a better overall treatment outcome than a participant randomly selected from the standard therapy group. The components of overall outcome were clinical success (survival with resolution of bacteremia), infectious complications, safety complications, death, and health-related quality of life. In measuring outcomes this way, the researchers aimed to capture not only the end result of antibiotic therapy, but also participants’ treatment-related experiences during therapy. A committee of four infectious disease experts ranked study participants based on the desirability of their overall treatment outcome after 70 days of therapy. To avoid risk of bias, the committee did not know which treatment the participants received.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study team also did a more conventional analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of dalbavancin therapy to standard therapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Investigators found that a participant randomly selected from the dalbavancin group was 47.7% likely to have a better overall treatment outcome than a participant randomly selected from the standard therapy group, meaning dalbavancin was not superior to standard therapy. However, the individual components of overall outcome, such as clinical success, were similar for the two groups, suggesting that dalbavancin therapy and standard therapy were equally good. This was reinforced by the finding from the conventional analysis that dalbavancin and standard therapy were similarly safe and effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our findings give patients and healthcare providers the data to support an extra choice when deciding on treatment for complicated &lt;em&gt;S. aureus &lt;/em&gt;bacteremia,” said Nicholas A. Turner, M.D., assistant professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, and first author of the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To the investigators’ surprise, study participants in the two groups reported a similar health-related quality of life. It is unclear whether this is because the quality-of-life survey given to participants at each study visit failed to capture relevant differences between the groups, or because the way the antibiotics were delivered had little effect on participants’ treatment experiences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As expected, the rate of side effects leading to treatment discontinuation and of complications such as catheter-associated blood clots were greater in the standard therapy group than the dalbavancin therapy group. Yet the overarching similarities in the components of overall outcome diluted these differences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To further compare the two types of therapy for complicated &lt;em&gt;S. aureus &lt;/em&gt;bacteremia, the investigators are analyzing their cost effectiveness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Called “Dalbavancin as an Option for Treatment of &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; Bacteremia” (DOTS), the study was conducted by the NIH’s Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group under the leadership of Thomas L. Holland, M.D. Dr. Holland is a professor of medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine and a member of the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More information about the DOTS trial is available in ClinicalTrials.gov under study identifier &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04775953"&gt;NCT04775953&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;h1&gt;Quitting smoking is associated with recovery from other addictions&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;NIH-funded finding supports addressing smoking cessation during substance use treatment&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;a href="/sites/default/files/2025-08/group-of-people-sitting-%20together-comforting-man_0.jpeg" class="link--no-tag link--zoom-in"&gt;&lt;article class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-float-right"&gt;
  
      
  

  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adults who smoke cigarettes and are addicted to alcohol or other drugs were more likely to achieve sustained remission of their substance use disorder symptoms if they also quit smoking, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Based on their analysis of data from a large U.S. study of smoking and health, researchers believe the results clearly show the benefit of pairing smoking cessation with addiction recovery efforts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We now have strong evidence from a national sample that quitting cigarette smoking predicts improved recovery from other substance use disorders,” explained Nora Volkow, M.D., director of NIH’s National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which partly funds the study, known as the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. “It underscores the importance of addressing different addictions together, rather than in isolation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists analyzed data from 2,652 people 18 and older who had a history of substance use disorder and who experienced a change in their recovery status over the next four years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants in the PATH Study are asked annually about their smoking status and other substance use. In this analysis, a change in smoking status from “current” to “former” use of cigarettes was associated with 42% greater odds of the individual being in recovery from their non-tobacco substance use disorder. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with addiction to alcohol or other substances have a higher likelihood of being addicted to nicotine as well. Previous research has suggested an association between smoking cessation and improved outcomes from other substance use disorders. However, the authors note that most prior studies used data from treatment centers focusing on addiction to a single substance or from smoking cessation trials, and those that used nationally representative samples could not adequately test for an association with recovery. Researchers believe the new finding is generalizable to the millions of adults with substance use disorder and accounts for numerous confounding factors, thus increasing confidence in the results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Although the health benefits of quitting smoking are well-known, smoking cessation has not been seen as a high priority in drug addiction treatment programs,” said Wilson Compton, M.D., deputy director of NIDA and senior author of the study. “This finding bolsters support for including smoking cessation as part of addiction treatment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although this was a longitudinal analysis that was strongly suggestive that quitting smoking plays a role in improved recovery outcomes from other substance use disorders, further research will be needed to definitively establish a causal connection. Also needed is more research on the best ways to support smoking cessation among people in treatment or recovery for substance use disorders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PATH Study is an ongoing, nationally representative longitudinal cohort study of youth and adults who may or may not use tobacco products that is funded by NIH and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They are an important source of nutrients that contribute to healthy teeth and bones, and the calcium in them also helps to prevent tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Chia seeds can also help to freshen your breath.

Yum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you fancy being healthy while you're eating something typically unhealthy, then it's also worth adding them to your next chocolate pudding.

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have pinpointed why millions of people struggle to get a good night's sleep—and it's not lumpy pillows or a racing mind, the problem lies in their GUT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, published in medical journal General Psychiatry, researchers explored the link between nodding off and the presence of certain types of bacteria in the digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study lead Shangyun Shi, from Nanjing Medical University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-a9753600-783b-11f0-a7d9-8dd34cb6decb"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, concluded that there appears to be a direct link between &lt;span&gt;gut bacteria and the risk of insomnia.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ms Shi used the data from 386,533 people with insomnia and compared it with data taken from two studies into microbiomes—totalling 26,548 people—who had 71 groups of bacteria in common. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concluded that certain types of bacteria seem to boost or lower the risk of insomnia, and the sleep disorder itself also seems to alter the presence of certain types of bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis revealed a total of 14 groups of bacteria were positively associated (1-4 per cent higher odds), and 8 groups negatively associated (1-3 per cent lower odds), with insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insomnia was also noted to have an effect on gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was linked to a reduction of 43 per cent to 79 per cent of seven groups of bacteria, and a more than four-fold increase in the abundance of 12 other groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

While prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are complicated conditions, new research suggests taking a vitamin D supplement may help lower blood sugar in certain groups. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11938431/#abstract1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the Endocrine Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of the Endocrine Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed data from 10 clinical trials involving nearly 4,500 people with prediabetes. The researchers discovered that 18.5% of study participants who took vitamin D reached normal blood sugar levels, compared to 14% who took a placebo. In all of the trials, the data showed that people with prediabetes who took vitamin D were more likely to develop normal blood sugar levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=christak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sylvia Christakos, Ph.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sylvia Christakos, Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;., is a vitamin D researcher and professor of microbiology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School; &lt;a href="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessica Cording, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, is author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game Changers&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/199050-david-m-cutler" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Cutler, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Cutler, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; is a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/ankit-shah" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ankit Shah, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ankit Shah, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., assistant professor in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Nutrition at Rutgers – Robert Wood Johnson Medical School; &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/anastassios-pittas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anastassios Pittas, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anastassios Pittas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, is a study co-author and a professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection between vitamin D and blood sugar management seems random, but doctors say there is something to this. But experts warn this does not mean you should forego a regimen or treatment recommended by your doctor in favor of a supplement. Here’s what the research found, and what it may mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is vitamin D?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, per the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamind-healthprofessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH). Also known as calciferol, the vitamin helps your gut’s absorption of calcium. If you don’t have enough vitamin D, your bones may become thin and brittle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vitamin D plays many roles in the body, including reducing inflammation and supporting immune function and blood sugar metabolism, according to the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is produced by your body when your skin is exposed to the sun’s rays, and it’s also found in some foods, like certain fatty fish, mushrooms, and fortified milk and cereal, says &lt;a href="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording, R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessica Cording, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game Changers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might vitamin D help with blood sugar management?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s still being explored, although this isn’t the first time vitamin D has been linked with managing diabetes. A scientific analysis published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M22-3018" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Annals of Internal Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 2023 analyzed three clinical trials that studied the impact of vitamin D supplementation on people with prediabetes. During a three-year follow-up, the researchers discovered that 22.7% of participants who took vitamin D developed type 2 diabetes, compared to 25% of those who took a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences aren’t massive—meaning, taking a vitamin D supplement isn’t a guarantee that you’ll avoid developing type 2 diabetes—but many experts agree that there does seem to be something here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One theory behind this link is that vitamin D impacts glycemic control, which is your body’s ability to manage your blood sugar, Cording says. “Vitamin D is actually a hormone,” Cording points out. Having healthy levels of vitamin D may &lt;em&gt;in theory&lt;/em&gt; help regulate other hormones in the body, helping to support the function of your endocrine system. (Type 2 diabetes impacts the endocrine system, which regulates glucose, a.k.a. blood sugar, levels in the blood, Cording explains.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is also &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1758-5996-5-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a lower risk of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a38595773/what-is-insulin-resistance-syndrome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which is when the body is unable to respond to or use the hormone insulin. Insulin helps to escort sugar to your cells, where it’s used for energy. Insulin resistance is often seen as a part of prediabetes and a precursor for type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, vitamin D may have an anti-inflammatory effect, and inflammation is a known risk factor for developing diabetes,” says &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/ankit-shah" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ankit Shah, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ankit Shah, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., assistant professor in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Nutrition at Rutgers, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are still a lot of unknowns here. “The mechanisms involved in potential helpful effects of vitamin D in lowering the risk for type 2 diabetes at this time have not been well defined,” says &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=christak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sylvia Christakos, Ph.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sylvia Christakos, Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;., a vitamin D researcher and professor of microbiology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she points out that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9938722/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; suggest that people with low vitamin D levels also seem to have impaired pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance. Both of those are linked to the development of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also entirely possible that there’s nothing to this link, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/199050-david-m-cutler" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Cutler, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Cutler, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “It’s very easy to find studies that show associations,” he says. “You have to accept that many studies that were done showed no association and never came to light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I use vitamin D to manage blood sugar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of right now, there’s no official recommendation on using vitamin D to manage blood sugar in people with prediabetes. However, Christakos recommends having your vitamin D levels tested if you’re at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. If you’re low, your doctor may recommend that you take a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g35686472/best-vitamin-d-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D supplement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D supplement&lt;/a&gt; to support several areas of your health, not just your blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shah agrees. “While vitamin D deficiency and diabetes are two separate issues that have different treatment strategies, there might be a benefit such that treating one issue may have positive spillover effects on the other,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your doctor says you could benefit from taking a vitamin D supplement, it’s important to have the right expectations for what this could do for you, says &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/anastassios-pittas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anastassios Pittas, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anastassios Pittas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and a professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin D should be viewed as part of an overall diabetes prevention plan, not a stand-alone solution,” he says. “In the vitamin D and diabetes prevention trials, participants took an average of about 4,000 IU of vitamin D daily. That dose would be a good starting point.” He says some people may need a bit less or more, depending on their lifestyle and size. Again, it’s important to consult your doctor before adding a supplement to your routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cording says it’s important to keep in mind that you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; overdo it with vitamin D. So, you don’t want to put yourself on this vitamin without talking to a healthcare professional first. “Taking too much vitamin D can lead to vitamin D toxicity,” she points out. That can cause your body to absorb too much calcium, raising your risk of kidney stones and constipation. In extreme cases, it may even lead to heart rhythm issues, kidney failure, and death, per the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamind-healthprofessional/#h36" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to lower type 2 diabetes risk &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shah stresses that you’re not doomed to develop type 2 diabetes if you’ve been diagnosed with prediabetes. “Having prediabetes puts you at risk for developing overt type 2 diabetes, but it does not have to be a foregone conclusion,” he says. “One can prevent, or at least delay, this progression by employing multiple well-known strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means focusing on eating a low-glycemic diet, doing your best to manage your weight (as this may impact insulin resistance), and exercising regularly, Dr. Cutler says. “These are all proven to both prevent type 2 diabetes and help with blood sugar control,” he says. Dr. Shah also recommends trying to reduce your stress levels and aiming to get at least seven hours of sleep a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it’s important to have a conversation with your healthcare provider if you’ve been diagnosed with prediabetes. They should be able to give you personalized guidance on next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:05:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1Hc25HekppWnM4ZHlBTElJVm9lZzUydGd0Rm0xSWF1a3dzZTMtd093UWpNVHBJbUwtR2Rvek05blpxVWdaQ19KSXlzWGllNm0tUEVTZ3NRdmxyUzBYN3FjZFRuUlhPRzV5cl9LbmhQUVNqWV81Z0JxOA</guid></item><item><title>新疗法在82%的患者中消除了膀胱癌-南加州大学凯克医学院</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQMFZ5YV83OGRPWDdIaTlCYUtaZ0ZTbXBqQmFCQ1hGTUN4MVJmS1ZTRkx5Wlc4YzdLQzRPVmVXdDZyR3VNbi1JT3hpUkNhNlFGTWJYVUNPSER4aTA5cUdFcUhJX3gycDlmdlJjUXhKWkRoYWNVRUd2MDc4QjdXM25ickxBLVdldnk0V3VUQnJGaVl0QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="text_companyprofile"&gt;

         &lt;/a&gt;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the drug delivery system works &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;TAR-200 is a miniature, pretzel-shaped drug-device duo containing a chemotherapy drug, gemcitabine, which is inserted into the bladder through a catheter. Once inside the bladder, the TAR-200 slowly and consistently releases the gemcitabine into the organ for three weeks per treatment cycle.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Traditionally, gemcitabine has been delivered to the bladder as a liquid solution that only stays in the bladder for a few hours, which had limited effect destroying the cancer, said Daneshmand, who is also a member of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/services/cancer-care/norris-cancer-center/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The theory behind this study was that the longer the medicine sits inside the bladder, the more deeply it would penetrate the bladder and the more cancer it would destroy,” he said. “And it appears that having the chemotherapy released slowly over weeks rather than in just a few hours is a much more effective approach.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient population in the clinical trial &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The clinical trial, known as the SunRISe-1, was conducted at 144 locations globally, including at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/about/keck-hospital-of-usc/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;Keck Hospital of USC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It included 85 patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is the most common form of bladder cancer. The disease is considered high risk when, depending on the type and location of the tumors, the cancer carries a higher chance of recurrence and/or spreading to the bladder muscles or other parts of the body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The standard treatment for this type of bladder cancer is an immunotherapy drug, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, which may be ineffective in a percentage of patients. All the patients in the clinical trial had been previously treated with this drug, but their cancer had returned.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The standard treatment plan for these patients &lt;span&gt;was surgery to remove the bladder and surrounding tissue and organs, which has many health risks and may negatively impact patients’ quality of life,” said Daneshmand. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To offer patients a better option, urologic oncologists treated patients with TAR-200 every three weeks for six months, and then four times a year for the next two years. In 70 out of 85 patients, the cancer disappeared and for almost half the patients, was still gone a year later. The treatment was well-tolerated, with minimal side effects.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study also showed that administering TAR-200 along with another immunotherapy drug (cetrelimab) did not prove as effective as TAR-200 on its own and had more side effects.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While participants in the clinical trial will be followed for another year, the study is closed to new participants. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of slow-release cancer drugs &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This clinical trial is one of several ongoing ones investigating the effect of TAR-200 and the slow release of cancer-fighting drugs into the bladder to fight cancer.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We are at an exciting moment in history,” said Daneshmand, who has been researching this novel treatment since 2016. “Our mission is to deliver cancer-fighting medications into the bladder that will offer lasting remission from cancer, and it looks like we are well on our way toward that goal.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted TAR-200 a New Drug Application Priority Review, which means the FDA plans to take quicker action on the application than other applications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health care corporation Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson manufactures TAR-200.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

Specifically, while incline &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/walking-vs-running-2"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;, subjects burned an average of 40.6 percent of their calories from fat, compared with an average of 33 percent for running. That result, on its own, would make it appear that incline walking is more effective at burning fat than running. However, that’s actually not the case at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The (real) takeaway you need to know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here’s where people get tripped up,” says Joe Ghafari, certified personal trainer, nutritionist, and nutritional educator at the weight-loss company Eden. “The body uses different fuel sources—carbs or fat—depending on exercise intensity. Low-to-moderate intensity, like walking uphill, keeps you in that fat-oxidation sweet spot. That’s what we often refer to as ‘zone two’ heart rate, and it is awesome for building metabolic endurance and improving how your body burns fat over time. But just because you’re using a higher percentage of fat doesn’t automatically mean you're burning more total fat or hitting a bigger calorie deficit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incline walking may burn a higher percentage of &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-much-fat-per-day-diet"&gt;fat&lt;/a&gt; for fuel than running, but it also takes much longer to do so. In the data, we can see that running burned significantly more calories per minute than incline walking. Subjects torched an average of 13 calories per minute while running, versus 10 while incline walking. That’s a huge difference. It also means that participants had to run just 23 minutes to burn the same amount of calories as they did with 30 minutes of incline walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data shows that when matched for total calorie burn, incline walking led to a higher percentage of calories burned from fat compared to running,” Ghafari says. “But it doesn’t mean incline walking burns more total fat. While incline walking uses more fat as fuel percentage-wise, the total fat burned might still be less.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fat of the matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to burn some fat, you really can’t go wrong with either incline walking or running—although running will probably still get you there faster, due to the overall higher calorie burn. Ultimately, the success of your weight-loss efforts will hinge on your ability to maintain a caloric deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're trying to lose weight and lose fat, the answer is a run, because of the caloric expenditure,” says Cristina Del Toro Badessa, MD, wellness physician and director at tktk &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.artisanplasticsurgery.com/our-team/dr-cristina-del-toro-badessa/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.artisanplasticsurgery.com/our-team/dr-cristina-del-toro-badessa/"}' href="https://www.artisanplasticsurgery.com/our-team/dr-cristina-del-toro-badessa/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Artisan Beaut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, incline walking burned about 22 percent more calories from fat than running did. But the subjects only ran for 23 minutes, which is 25 percent less time than they spent incline walking. So, with a little back-of-the-napkin math, we can see that running would actually utilize about the same amount of fat as incline walking over the same period of time (while also burning roughly 25 percent more total calories).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPQ19EOVFKa1BJNmVHQWd1YVMyUG9qYjRQWHdmRWJlMzZRdVAtQUpPTXZSSXY4UDh0RHdkNVVoU3NidmQ2RDJINjJLaVFicHFZWXFlLS1JS096MHJ5ZDNQSE02emwyRmlILVVJbGRPd3dWajJMUjZGQkY0YUFGX2Z0TjVzeWY0N3B5U1c4</guid></item><item><title>第二例肉毒杆菌中毒死亡与食品卡车三明治有关-《独立报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOckg3VUQxZTFJZWdibWtUQzE3SFFtY2xzWUdMSWZ4enBqX1RjTHJSWUlDR1h6dGUzeGlRUUthZjZYVURVU29vOGZzZFRDbk1Tby16b1B0U2dQaU9lV08zUVFoVnZ2U08yM2hsaE1lbkplYzBtcjNXSXgtQTVDY1UzRjBRV0RpUGppVkR1RlhvemxBdnJkUFF4WlNsQXlRcWpva1V0S0RWeDVQQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-1d79dbf-0 hpUznh"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sc-erjdy9-0 hKUIcv"&gt;Thank you for registering&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1ty8yds-2 uWTBa"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1ty8yds-0 bbjlNt"&gt;Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1ty8yds-1 SkKtY"&gt;Please refresh your browser to be logged in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 13:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOckg3VUQxZTFJZWdibWtUQzE3SFFtY2xzWUdMSWZ4enBqX1RjTHJSWUlDR1h6dGUzeGlRUUthZjZYVURVU29vOGZzZFRDbk1Tby16b1B0U2dQaU9lV08zUVFoVnZ2U08yM2hsaE1lbkplYzBtcjNXSXgtQTVDY1UzRjBRV0RpUGppVkR1RlhvemxBdnJkUFF4WlNsQXlRcWpva1V0S0RWeDVQQQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
