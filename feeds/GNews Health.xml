True, but so are eggs, pork loin and Brussels sprouts. That’s because they’re rich in choline, a nutrient related to B vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VWEUT74FNFGCXIWDZYLUCHLHSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Choline is critically important for a variety of body and brain functions,” says Ramon Velazquez, an assistant professor at the Arizona State University-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center in Tempe. It’s part of all cell membranes, and in recent years there’s been increasing evidence linking it to &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/mental-health/boost-your-brainpower-at-any-age-a1999739192/"&gt;better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; and even a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. But about 90 percent of people don’t get enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GNZCEQECOBH2BMVZCTENHJQQTU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GNZCEQECOBH2BMVZCTENHJQQTU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The memory effect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DAF6AXK5QBB5PCV7RVDTJB2TIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The brain needs choline to make acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. “These [neurotransmitters] are chemicals that build and connect neurons [nerve cells] in the brain and body, and allow them to communicate with each other,” says Thomas B. Shea, a professor of biological sciences at UMass Lowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NAL4REGZLBF5PC35NFYD56S3HE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research has found that levels of acetylcholine naturally decline with age and that people with Alzheimer’s disease have lower-than-normal levels. “The connection is seen both in age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s,” Velazquez says. “Lower levels of acetylcholine may affect your ability to form and recall memories, as well as affect word recall and focus.” A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8570899/"&gt;2021 study published in Behavioral Neurology&lt;/a&gt; found that people who got 188 to 400 mg per day of choline had a 40 percent reduced risk of experiencing low cognitive function than those who got less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4TN66PRMGBHARFXGAHNYJ72HJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some research suggests that specific types of choline may be more beneficial than others. For example, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522013375?via%3Dihub"&gt;2019 study involving almost 500 men, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, every 50 mg intake per day of phosphatidylcholine was linked to a 10 percent decrease in dementia risk. Eggs were the main source of it in the men’s diet. A large egg has 169 mg of choline, about 70 percent of which is phosphatidylcholine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4CSLFF23WJBCBHVB7B74BBEIVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s even the potential that increasing choline intake after an Alzheimer’s diagnosis may help. “In studies of people with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease,” Velazquez says, “we’ve seen that supplementing with choline may slow the progression of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6M4OQNPZNZBDDORIQVSQKNG6XE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are other benefits to making sure that your diet contains plenty of choline. It plays a role in both fat and glucose metabolism. “Not getting enough choline can increase the risk of fatty liver disease, Type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases,” Velazquez says. Adequate choline may also protect against heart disease and strokes by helping to control the inflammation that contributes to those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="O6V6JZGXMVB3ND22P7O4WBWW2M" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="O6V6JZGXMVB3ND22P7O4WBWW2M" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How much choline do you need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GD3S6BP5KJFNBOGPVZII5POLBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Your body produces some choline, but it’s nowhere near enough to perform all of these critical functions,” Velazquez says. The Daily Value for choline is 550 mg, and that needs to come from food or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3V2VNMOEBJC6BNGJ2PBCKUIUPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s not hard to get the choline you need through diet,” Shea says. Many foods contain at least some, and there are several that provide substantial amounts (see below). “But sometimes older adults start eating fewer calories or less variety of foods. In that case, supplementation may be in order.” Supplements can also be a good idea for people who eat a mostly plant-based diet because many of the foods highest in choline are animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZWX5G7P2R5H7LHX2BU533KCJAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You might not be able to rely on a multivitamin to help meet your choline needs, though; some brands contain little to none of the nutrient. If you’re going to take a supplement, Shea recommends choosing one that has about 300 mg. As with any supplement, you should discuss it with your doctor beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CNH5AYZILJB6NLVKDYZATXQF7M" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CNH5AYZILJB6NLVKDYZATXQF7M" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Top sources of choline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KY6JF7K2EVEMPDPM7KYEKVOXGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You can find choline in a variety of foods, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="NZEOLVL3TZHRLDVU75FK4MGYXA" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beef liver, 3.5 oz.

				&lt;p&gt;Tick season is upon New England — and some unexpected visitors have come up north to join the usual crew, one study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Massachusetts Amherst center has found and studied two ticks in Maine that are capable of infecting people with rare, possibly fatal, sicknesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New England Center of Excellence of Vector-borne Diseases, led by UMass Amherst microbiology professor Stephen Rich, scans residential backyards in New England as a part of an ongoing study in its third year to develop better practices for tick control, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherst-tick-researchers-identify-new-strain-rickettsia-bacteria-causes-spotted"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In one of the sets of properties that we looked at in Maine, we found some rather extraordinary ticks that we don’t usually see,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usual ticks found in the Northeast are deer, dog, and human ticks that often carry Lyme disease. In this survey, which catches ticks by placing down a white cloth and then extracting them, researchers found a “preponderous” amount of uncommon rabbit ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, some of these ticks carried a unique, rare microbe called Rickettsia similar to a strain found in California that has led to people contracting potentially fatal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/about/index.html"&gt;Rocky Mountain spotted fever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said that rabbit ticks don’t often feed on humans, but a likely scenario is that a more common tick feeds on an infected rabbit that can then transmit to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a low risk factor, but it is something that we didn’t know about until now, and it’s something we want to understand a little bit better and make sure that it is infrequent, and that it’s not something that has the potential to bridge over,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second case found does not cause disease, but rather an allergy — to red meat. Alpha-gal syndrome is becoming increasingly common in areas where the Lone Star tick, the usual culprit, is established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this year, alpha-gal syndrome has been found in &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-1265_article#:~:text=Maine%20CDC%20received%20positive%20%CE%B1,were%20%3E65%20years%20of%20age."&gt;57 residents in Maine&lt;/a&gt;, whose climate is not typical for the Lone Star tick. The allergy was recently found to have been linked to the black-legged tick after a woman reported being bitten by one and then developing an intolerance to red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding of not a tick but a patient that had alpha-gal … was what made that finding quite notable,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said the most effective way to avoid tick bites is to treat clothing with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553150"&gt;permethrin&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical that can kill ticks and other arthropods within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a tick does bite, the time it takes for it to infect a person differs from case to case, but Rich said the average time for Lyme disease to enter a person’s body is 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you take the tick off earlier, you can greatly reduce the risk of exposure from the stuff inside that tick,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said the finding of both of these “relatively rare events” within the same time period is likely due to there being more surveillance — the team is able to look “more carefully than we did in the past,” thanks to the study, which received &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/cdc-designates-new-england-center-excellence-vector-borne-diseases-umass-amherst"&gt;$10 million&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re doing the testing to provide impactful information to homeowners,” Rich said. “Because we’re doing that, and that wasn’t taking place before, we’re bound to make new discoveries of this kind.”&lt;/p&gt;

He has not entered a plea for the malice and felony murder charges, per Atlanta News First.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair wed in 2014, three years before Denise was diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time in 2017, according to both outlets. After she went into remission, the cancer returned in 2019, per Atlanta News First. The cancer eventually cleared once again following years of treatment, but Denise remained sick — with new tests ultimately leading to a 2022 AIDS diagnosis shortly before her death on April 2, 2022, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/hiv-transmission-via-cosmetic-injections-vampire-facial-cdc-report-8639524" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC Reports First Investigation of HIV Transmission via Cosmetic Injections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC Reports First Investigation of HIV Transmission via Cosmetic Injections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlanta News First &lt;/p&gt; Denise Broadie&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleveland, now 62, was later charged with three counts of reckless conduct in 2023, after other women came forward, with investigators claiming at the time that he was aware of his HIV-positive status and had been taking medication for it since 2006, per a previous report from &lt;a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/07/19/man-charged-with-felony-reckless-conduct-not-disclosing-hiv-status/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Atlanta News First;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Atlanta News First&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Cleveland's initial charges, Denise's family continued to push forward with an investigation, as Fox 5 Atlanta notes, by hiring private investigators to look into his past and prove he was aware of his HIV-positive status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Rockdale County Jail's online records, Cleveland was initially arrested in July 2023 and booked again on April 16 of this year over the new arrest warrant/indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Young, Denise's daughter who described her mom as a family matriarch with a heart of gold, told Fox 5 Atlanta that she believes there was "malice" in Cleveland's actions. "At any time, he could have told her and given her the right to make the decision to stay with him," she said.

&lt;p&gt;Lexington had 1,169 STI cases per 100,000 residents, 2,919 Chlamydia cases, 1,622 Gonorrhea cases, 223 Syphilis cases and 109 HIV cases, according to numbers from the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) latest STI Surveillance Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Lexington had the highest rate of STIs in Kentucky, another city in the Bluegrass State had more cases overall.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other Kentucky city to make the list of the top 100 U.S. cities with the highest rates of STIs was Louisville, known for hosting the Kentucky Derby every year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisville ranked 59th with 819 cases per 100,000 residents, 7,462 Chlamydia cases, 3,328 Gonorrhea cases, 313 Syphilis cases and 216 HIV cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities in the U.S. South account for over 60% of the top 25 metropolitan areas with the highest STI rates in this year's study, with Louisiana home to three of the 25 cities with the highest STI rates and Florida home to two cities in the top 25.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Groth said on Monday that Cole is expected to spend “at least a couple of months” in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, where he will be fed intravenously due to complications with his intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every day gives us a bit more hope, so hopefully that continues,” Groth said. “You just never know, he could have a setback anyday… The surgeon [told us] we have to hope for some ‘boring days’ ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cole was born March 31 at New York-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, with congenital cardiac issues. Doctors in the NICU placed a stent in Cole’s heart, after which the infant was considered “one of the healthiest babies on the floor,” his dad wrote in &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-cole-jordan-groths-fight-for-life"&gt;a GoFundMe appeal&lt;/a&gt;. At 11 p.m. on April 14, two days before Cole’s scheduled discharge, medical staff asked Tim and wife Gabrielle – Cole’s mom – if they wanted their son to be circumcised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Long Island, New York couple agreed to the routine procedure, but claim no one ever told them that circumcision &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/HCQ.0000000000000113"&gt;presented a serious bleeding risk&lt;/a&gt; for babies with congenital heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 etWNXC"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/05/IMG_3486.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/05/IMG_3486.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/05/IMG_3486.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt='Cole Groth is expected to remain in the hospital for "at least a couple of months," according to his dad' class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-16500"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Cole Groth is expected to remain in the hospital for "at least a couple of months," according to his dad&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Courtesy of the Groth family)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything seemed fine for the first two hours after the circumcision, according to a timeline laid out by Tim on his GoFundMe page. Then, around 2:30 a.m., things took a turn for the worse. Cole’s diaper was “full of blood, stool, urine, so full that it had leaked onto the sheets and his leg,” the fundraiser says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hospital staffer alerted the nurse practitioner who performed the circumcision that there were problems, and the nurse practitioner rewrapped Cole’s penis with adhesive strips. However, Cole’s condition continued to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six hours later, unable to stop the bleeding, doctors intubated Cole, and shortly after 9 a.m., he received an urgent transfusion of 40ml/kg of blood. Babies of this age typically have between 80ml/kg and 90ml/kg of blood in their bodies, meaning Cole lost roughly half the blood in his body, according to Tim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the bleeding led to a frightening series of seizures, along with kidney damage, liver damage and neurological damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next three days, Cole seemed to be recovering. But, Tim said, at 4 a.m. on April 19, the hospital called and told him and his wife that parts of Cole’s intestines had necrotized and needed to be removed immediately. The 20-day-old baby was rushed into the operating room, where doctors rushed to excise the dead tissue, the family’s GoFundMe page explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JOhlJ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/26/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-10-48-46-AM.png" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/26/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-10-48-46-AM.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/26/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-10-48-46-AM.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Groth and his newborn son, Cole.

Trump took office for his second term, thousands of health websites run by the federal government that kept the public informed about infectious diseases, mental health, vaccines and more were taken offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Many eventually returned — in large part because a judge ordered the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/cdc-website-restore-pages-trump.html" title=""&gt;temporarily restore the pages&lt;/a&gt; — but some had been altered, with sections on topics such as health equity and teen pregnancy deleted. The changes, along with uncertainty around the future of these sites, has led some public health experts to question whether the websites can still be trusted as the gold standard of trustworthy health information, as they’ve long been regarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Federal health agencies are already facing a crisis of confidence. When a recent &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;national poll&lt;/a&gt; asked respondents how much trust they had in the C.D.C. to make the right health recommendations, more than one-third replied “not much” or “not at all.” Nearly half said the same about the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Experts fear that with less trust in public health institutions, more people seeking medical information might turn to social media, where misinformation is rampant. That has made it all the more valuable for the public to find evidenced-based sources of health information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here are five websites run by independent organizations that have accurate, easy-to-understand information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-357e41a8"&gt;1.

						&lt;p&gt;The SPCA of Wake County will close temporarily April 27-May 2 for deep cleaning due to a recent outbreak of canine parvovirus (CPV).&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Although the adoption center on Petfinder Lane will be closed for the next several days, &lt;a href="https://spcawake.org/appointments/" target="_blank"&gt;the SPCA is still accepting online adoption surveys&lt;/a&gt;, and cat adoptions will resume on April 30.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;According to the SPCA, parvovirus is a highly contagious virus that mainly impacts dogs, especially unvaccinated puppies. Parvovirus attacks the gastrointestinal tract and can lead to severe dehydration or death if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The SPCA of Wake County connected the outbreak to a litter of puppies that came to the SPCA from an overcrowded shelter in a nearby county. According to the SPCA, two puppies in the litter of six had parvovirus and are being treated. None of the puppies have died. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;People who recently adopted a pet exposed to the litter have been notified, and all exposed dogs are being monitored and quarantined, the SPCA said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Parvovirus is typically spread through direct contact with an infected dog or through contaminated surfaces, food, water bowls or human hands. It can survive for months, which is why a deep clean is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The SPCA of Wake County shared steps pet owners can take to protect their puppies from parvovirus:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/spca-wake-county-parvo-outbreak-closing-april-2024"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/spca-wake-county-parvo-outbreak-closing-april-2024/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vaccination: &lt;/b&gt;Ensure your puppy receives the full series of vaccinations. Speak with your veterinarian about your puppy’s vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limit exposure: &lt;/b&gt;Avoid public places, such as dog parks or pet stores, until your puppy is fully vaccinated. Parvovirus is easily transmitted in environments where many dogs gather.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good hygiene: &lt;/b&gt;Keep your dog's living area clean and disinfected. Use appropriate cleaners that are effective against viruses. Regularly wash food and water bowls, toys and bedding.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seek veterinary advice&lt;/b&gt; if your puppy shows any signs of illness—such as lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite—contact your veterinarian immediately for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;

In fact, you might be surprised to learn that a new study published in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-024-46116-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiet-nutrition%2Fa64542423%2Fstudy-fiber-supplements-brain-health%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Communications;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that consuming &lt;strong&gt;prebiotic fiber supplements&lt;/strong&gt; can improve cognition by increasing good bacteria in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew via the growing body of existing research into the gut-brain axis that the potential was there to influence cognition via the gut microbiome,” says study author &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/mary-ni-lochlainn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Ni Lochlainn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mary Ni Lochlainn&lt;/a&gt;, M.B.B.Ch., Ph.D., a clinical lecturer at &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kings College London;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kings College London&lt;/a&gt;. “However, we were surprised that our simple prebiotic was able to achieve a difference in a short 12-week intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the researchers find? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a quick reminder: Prebiotics are food for probiotics, &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health-products/g31040353/best-probiotic-for-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the famous good gut bacteria;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the famous good gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that aid digestion and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study included 36 pairs of twins ages 60 and older. (Studying twins helps researchers reduce the effects of differences in ages, genes and early life environments between study groups.) Half took a daily supplement of protein powder mixed with a prebiotic supplement made of inulin (found in garlic, artichokes and chicory root) and fructo-oligosaccharides (found in leeks, onions and asparagus). Their twins ate the same protein powder mixed with a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the 12-week study, the siblings who consumed prebiotic fiber improved their scores on a series of cognitive tests, on average, compared to their twin.&lt;/strong&gt; They made fewer errors on a test of visual memory and learning ability that can reveal early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease and dementia. They also had increased gut levels of Actinobacteria, especially beneficial &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How might prebiotic fiber affect thinking and memory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem far-fetched that this bacterial shift could change your brain, but researchers point to the gut-brain axis connecting the two organs. “We know our prebiotic led to an increase in &lt;em&gt;bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;, which is thought of as a 'healthy' bacteria,” says Lochlainn. “We don't know the mechanism of how exactly this led to an improvement in cognition, but the gut-brain axis is connected in many ways, for example, direct nerve tracts such as the vagus nerve, hormonal signals other metabolites such as short chain fatty acids which communicate with the brain, and via immune pathways too.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could other prebiotics besides inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides — such as psyllium, the ingredient in many fiber supplements — shift gut bacteria to boost brain health? It’s plausible, says Lochlainn, but more research is needed since each fiber is unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, prebiotic fibers have plenty of perks, says &lt;a href="https://www.metabolicrds.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nina Olsen,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nina Olsen,&lt;/a&gt; R.D.N., L.D./C.D., the founder of Metabolic RDs.

Olsen suggests aiming for 25 to 35 grams of total fiber per day, including 10 to 20 grams of prebiotic fiber. If you're not there yet, add only 3 to 5 grams of prebiotic fiber per day and work your way up, says Olsen. If you consume too much too fast, you might experience bloating, constipation, or cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I explain this to my patients like a fish tank, where the probiotics are the fish and the prebiotics are the fish food,” says Olsen. “If you put too much fish food in, you're going to have a dirty fish tank and maybe a bunch of unhealthy fish. If you don't feed the fish as well, those fish are going to die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g43067442/best-prebiotic-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:food sources of prebiotic fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;food sources of prebiotic fiber&lt;/a&gt; like bananas, garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus and artichokes. “Think &lt;em&gt;variety over volume&lt;/em&gt;,” says Olsen. “Rotating fiber sources builds a stronger, more resilient microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're not getting enough fiber from your diet, a supplement can fill the gaps — and may even boost your brainpower. Supplements with psyllium, inulin, fructo-oligosaccharides or acacia fiber can be good choices. If you have a sensitive gut or a history of irritable bowel syndrome, Olsen recommends a partially hydrolyzed guar gum supplement. It’s a gentle prebiotic derived from guar beans.

In a carefully controlled experiment, healthy men who received testosterone showed amplified brain activity related to empathy for others’ inclusion and exclusion experiences, even though their self-reported feelings of empathy remained unchanged. These results suggest that testosterone may play a role in fine-tuning social vigilance by strengthening the brain’s sensitivity to emotionally significant cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy is often described as the ability to understand and share the emotions of others, and it has been widely studied in the context of negative experiences like sadness or distress. However, researchers have paid less attention to how positive empathy—feeling joy for others’ successes—may be influenced by hormones such as testosterone. Most prior research has focused on whether testosterone impairs empathy, particularly for others’ suffering. Much less is known about how it might shape more complex forms of social responsiveness in both positive and negative emotional contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team sought to bridge these gaps. They designed a study to test whether testosterone affects both positive and negative empathy when people observe social inclusion or exclusion events. They also aimed to understand whether testosterone could change brain activity at rest, setting the stage for different emotional reactions even before social interactions begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My research initially focused on empathy, as it’s a fundamental part of how we connect and interact with others. Over time, I became curious about how biological factors—especially hormones like testosterone—might influence this process,” said study author Weiwei Peng, a professor at Shenzhen University and director of the &lt;a href="https://www.pcml.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pain Cognition and Modulation Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most studies have explored how testosterone affects empathy in negative situations, much less is known about its role in positive empathy, like sharing in someone’s happiness, which is key to social bonding. We designed this study to explore both emotional reactions and brain activity to get a fuller picture of how testosterone may shape empathy. These insights could ultimately help us better support people with conditions like autism or depression, where empathy is often affected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers recruited 35 healthy young men, ultimately analyzing data from 34 participants after excluding one due to equipment issues. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, each participant completed two sessions spaced about a week apart. In one session, participants received a topical testosterone gel, and in the other, they received a placebo gel. The order of sessions was randomized, and neither participants nor researchers knew which gel was administered at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three hours after the gel application—timed to match the peak effects of testosterone—the participants first completed a resting-state brain recording using electroencephalography (EEG), a method that measures electrical activity in the brain. They then performed an empathy task, viewing images showing people either being socially included, excluded, or in neutral situations. After each image, participants rated how pleasant they thought the person in the image felt, as well as how pleasant they themselves felt while viewing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although participants’ ratings of empathy did not change between testosterone and placebo sessions, their brain activity told a different story. When witnessing social exclusion, participants who had received testosterone showed a stronger early brain response, known as the N2 component, which is thought to reflect rapid emotional processing and threat detection. This suggests that testosterone made participants’ brains more sensitive to signs of social rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When viewing scenes of social inclusion, testosterone altered brain activity in a different way. Participants exhibited a stronger suppression of brain waves in the alpha frequency range—a phenomenon known as alpha event-related desynchronization—over the back of the brain. This pattern is usually interpreted as a sign of increased engagement with emotionally significant or rewarding stimuli. In this case, it indicates that testosterone enhanced neural responsiveness to positive social experiences as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testosterone may tune the brain to better recognize both emotional pain and joy in others—even before we’re aware of it ourselves,” Peng told PsyPost. “Our study challenges the common view of testosterone as solely an ‘antisocial’ hormone. We found that it actually makes the brain more sensitive to both positive and negative social experiences, like feeling included or excluded. It didn’t change how empathic people said they felt, but it did make their brains react more strongly to emotional situations. That suggests testosterone could help us stay more tuned in to what others are feeling, which could have real value for people who struggle with social connection, such as those with autism or depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond these immediate reactions to social situations, testosterone also influenced the brain’s resting activity. Analysis of EEG recordings during rest revealed that testosterone prolonged the presence of a specific brain state known as microstate E. This brain pattern has been linked to emotional processing and awareness of internal bodily states. Importantly, participants who showed a larger testosterone-induced increase in microstate E also tended to show greater emotional empathy during the social tasks, even though they did not necessarily rate themselves as more empathetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that testosterone may increase a baseline sensitivity to emotional information, making the brain more responsive to both threats and rewards in social environments. Rather than simply dampening or boosting empathy in one direction, testosterone appears to fine-tune the brain’s social radar, enhancing the detection of both positive and negative social cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One surprising finding from our study was how testosterone changed the brain’s resting activity—specifically in a brain state called microstate E, which is tied to internal bodily awareness and emotion processing,” Peng explained. “Testosterone made this brain state last longer, and that increase actually predicted greater emotional empathy in both positive and negative situations. It suggests testosterone may heighten our sensitivity to emotional signals by tuning how we internally process and monitor those feelings—even before we respond outwardly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results align with theories proposing that testosterone is not purely a “dominance hormone” but rather a flexible regulator of social behavior. In environments where quick detection of social threats is important, testosterone might help individuals stay vigilant. In settings where cooperation and bonding are beneficial, it may enhance sensitivity to affiliative cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers important insights, it also has several limitations. The sample was relatively small and restricted to young adult males, limiting the ability to generalize the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since testosterone is often labeled as a male hormone, our study focused on men, which means the results might not apply to women or older adults,” Peng noted. “Another limitation is that while we saw clear changes in brain activity, these didn’t always lead to noticeable changes in behavior. That suggests testosterone’s effects may be subtler or depend on the social context. Going forward, we hope to study more diverse groups and use more real-world social situations to understand the full picture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these results by studying a broader range of participants, exploring long-term effects of testosterone, or combining hormone administration with behavioral interventions aimed at improving social functioning. There is particular interest in whether these findings could eventually inform strategies to support individuals with empathy deficits, such as those seen in autism spectrum disorders or certain mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testosterone is a fascinating topic, especially in the context of empathy,” Peng said. “We’re planning to explore how it interacts with other brain modulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and whether it could contribute to future interventions. This is particularly relevant for clinical conditions like autism or depression, where empathy is often disrupted. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how testosterone influences the brain’s empathy systems so we can help develop new ways to support emotional and social functioning in people who need it most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At our lab, we’re passionate about understanding how the brain processes pain and empathy. Personally, I’ve always been fascinated by how we recognize and respond to both our own and others’ emotional states. Our goal is to turn what we learn into real-world tools—interventions that help people better manage pain and build stronger empathic connections. By combining neuroimaging, cognitive neuroscience, and brain stimulation methods, we’re working to uncover how empathy and pain are wired in the brain—and how we can use that knowledge to improve people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2025.110465" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The role of testosterone in modulating positive and negative empathy in social interactions&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Shiwei Zhuo, Yinhua Zhang, Chennan Lin, Wen Wu, and Weiwei Peng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 14:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOdnJLMjVzemlSeGNYazJ3Mld2NVAxZVR4ZzJnODZUT21MU0hUekQtTlpJOTB0RjZ6NjY5am5KWmlWWDAxVksxLXY2RDZyRDVSZjZWaDBqeGNtd3lDVWt4V3VNSmtrcUFrby1TcVY1MGdwOEJSVlIyU2ZzOTJUa3poUDhBRTdRLS1DdWdaOGVuek84NVpkUFhMQlNRQzg0eW1pejhkRjd2aHdTT0FPUzBXS3dR</guid></item><item><title>循环呼吸法诱导与改善心理健康相关的意识状态改变- Medical Xpress | Circular breathwork induces altered states of consciousness linked to improved mental health - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQNGp0NEYyak9MT000eGp6S0JfZWRqNHFnUTdPSTY1d3hzbkxBdGt3cTRlQ2pwOXBOWElnbEs3T3NQanZYLXVlX0o0ckZqRkZ3MXJlRUU1UkhCRGEwNkx4WEZHbU13TktDbTZ1WjhTeDlfUnZOQm5paENObDFKRWhvakNrc3h4ZmRqSndWQlhBWVNrZ0hpdGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience, the MIND Foundation, alongside other collaborators, have found that reductions in carbon dioxide saturation during circular breathwork sessions were correlated with the emergence of altered states of consciousness. Altered states resembled those reported in psychedelic experiences and were associated with improvements in psychological well-being and reductions in depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Altered states of consciousness have shown promise as therapeutic approaches in treating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health disorders&lt;/a&gt; such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Legal, medical, and financial barriers limit the accessibility of psychedelic-assisted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular breathwork practices, rooted in traditional techniques such as Tummo and Pranayama Yoga, and adapted into forms such as Holotropic and Conscious-Connected breathwork, may present a more accessible, non-pharmacological alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These practices involve continuous, deep breathing without pauses between inhalation and exhalation, often conducted in communal settings and accompanied by emotionally evocative music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early studies suggest that circular breathwork may alleviate stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, while enhancing self-awareness and life satisfaction. Yet the physiological and psychological mechanisms underpinning these effects remain largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Decreased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; saturation during circular breathwork supports emergence of altered states of consciousness," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00247-0" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted an exploratory study to understand how circular breathwork may induce altered states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 61 participants with previous breathwork experience took part at the MIND Foundation's premises in Berlin, and 43 participants engaged in either Holotropic or Conscious-Connected breathwork sessions. A randomly selected control group of 18 was instructed to breathe normally to distinguish the effects of active breathwork from the session's communal and musical context.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Mental health outcomes were assessed in a subset of participants using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, administered one week before and one week after the breathwork session. Due to incomplete responses, final mental health analyses included 25 participants who completed both pre- and post-session questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (etCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at six time points using a portable breathalyzer device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjective experience depth was assessed using hand signals, one finger raised for normal waking consciousness, five fingers indicating a deeply altered state of consciousness. Biomarkers of autonomic nervous system activity and inflammation, specifically α-amylase and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), were analyzed from saliva samples collected before and after sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reductions in end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure were observed during active circular breathwork sessions compared to passive control participants. Active breathers experienced significant drops in etCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, reaching as low as 16.6 mmHg, compared to an average of 34.3 mmHg in passive breathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decreases in carbon dioxide levels correlated with deeper altered states of consciousness, measured both through real-time hand signal ratings and post-session questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active breathers reported subjective experiences comparable to those reported in studies of psychedelic substances, scoring similarly on the Mystical Experiences Questionnaire and the 11-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Scale.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Psychological well-being scores improved one week after the session among the subset (n=20) of active breathers with complete responses. Participants showed reductions in depressive symptoms measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and improvements in well-being assessed by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. Reductions in carbon dioxide levels and greater subjective experience depth predicted greater improvements in mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomarker analyses showed that salivary alpha-amylase concentrations decreased after breathwork sessions, suggesting reduced sympathetic nervous system activity, while levels of interleukin-1 beta increased, indicating a transient activation of inflammatory responses. Stronger altered state experiences were associated with smaller increases in inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results suggest that circular breathwork may offer a low-cost, non-pharmacological method for inducing altered states of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/consciousness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt; that contribute to psychological healing. Decreases in carbon dioxide saturation during breathwork sessions appeared to facilitate the onset of these states, which were linked to reductions in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depressive+symptoms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and improvements in well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an unregistered exploratory study with an incomplete cohort follow-up, any findings would require confirmation through more rigorous experimental design and execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whether you hop on the treadmill and bump it to a 10–12 incline, or find a hill or staircase near you, you'll fire up your glutes, core, and legs way more than flat walking ever could, which means more calories burned. Plus, your heart rate stays elevated, so you're basically getting a low-impact HIIT session that won't crush your joints," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science confirms that walking on an incline is an effective form of fitness, burning more calories than walking fast or even running on a flat surface, so many experts suggest upping your incline. A &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3707880//" target="_blank"&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt; even found that walking on a 2- to 7-percent incline increased heart rate by almost 10 percent compared to running on a flat surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willis recommends the following workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 min warm-up at a low incline (moderate pace, can easily put out a sentence)&lt;br&gt;
17 min incline walk (challenge pace, where you're slightly out of breath but can still talk)&lt;br&gt;
1 min cooldown (flat or lower incline)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be Consistent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Researchers found that neuroinflammation, trained innate immune memory, and cellular reprogramming may interact with amyloid and tau proteins to drive disease pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that Alzheimer’s may be partly an autoimmune disorder triggered by maladaptive immune responses to internal molecules. The findings offer new insight into how immune-driven inflammation could open pathways for future Alzheimer’s treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Role in Alzheimer’s:&lt;/strong&gt; Neuroinflammation and innate immune memory may initiate and sustain Alzheimer’s progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Amyloid and Tau:&lt;/strong&gt; Overactive immune responses to amyloid-beta and tau could be key triggers of disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting dysfunctional immune mechanisms may offer new approaches for Alzheimer’s treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Temple University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain tissue analysis of an animal model reveals the potential role of immune system dysfunction in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published April 15, 2025 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;, the new study uses RNA sequencing to demonstrate a link between neuroinflammation, innate immune memory, and cellular plasticity to AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109255"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an inflamed brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This study expands the current literature by evaluating whether epigenetically encoded innate immune memory (trained immunity) and cell trans-differentiation also contribute to the disease cascade.

Neuroinflammatory processes, mediated by glial and immune cells, contribute to neuronal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence implicates innate immune mechanisms, including trained immunity and cell trans-differentiation, in AD pathogenesis, though their roles remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate transcriptomic changes in the 3xTg-AD mouse model, focusing on trained immunity and cell trans-differentiation in disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA-sequencing was performed on brain tissue (cortex plus hippocampus) from 11-month-old female 3xTg-AD and wild-type mice (n = 3/group). Differentially expressed genes (fold change &amp;gt; 1.5, p &amp;lt; 0.05) were identified and followed by bioinformatics and knowledge-based transcriptomic profiling. Public AD datasets were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;3xTg-AD mice exhibited 316 upregulated and 412 downregulated genes.

Upregulation of genes associated with cell migration and trans-differentiation suggests a potential role for inflammation and cellular plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, genes involved in inflammasome pathways, immunometabolism, and trained immunity were upregulated. Mechanistically, these genes were modulated by knockdown of trained immunity promoter SET-7, overexpression of trained immunity inhibitor IL-37, and knockout of inflammasome genes IL-1 receptor, caspase-1, and pattern recognition receptor CD36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding underscore the potential role of trained immunity and cell trans-differentiation in AD, revealing a mechanistic framework in which danger-associated molecular patterns drive innate immune responses, inflammasome activation, and cell plasticity contribute to AD, offering therapeutic targets for neuroinflammation and cellular reprograming.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 13:59:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1FcWxmbFVVQkZMS293N3RoQkhxOGRyeFNKcUUxakxjZ1VJOTZHZ3VHN2wzQTBzS3dRazNreHNKM2NTXzZHSkJWc0s4MXJ5N3JaZE1YbFp4ekRoanR1NmF1WEdTOXVIakFHMV9OTmZESms1Zw</guid></item><item><title>与精神病大脑变化相关的大麻使用障碍-神经科学新闻 | Cannabis Use Disorder Linked to Psychosis Brain Changes - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFBHUlZrSkVKUU40alYzOTRrREdmWWJGVGNnN3RTUmlqeDk1a0RMZUVEdGlmdVZMWXo1WnlxcU02cF9NVmo5TVFJMVRyTEtRVVZpWDdOam5JNHNlTmFmVzltT21qOWd3LVNPUU5BbllQa1dYZGN1RVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that individuals with cannabis use disorder have elevated dopamine levels in brain regions associated with psychosis. Using neuromelanin-sensitive MRI scans, scientists found increased dopamine activity, visible as darker brain spots, in cannabis users regardless of schizophrenia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes suggest accelerated dopamine-related aging in the brain, helping explain the rise in cannabis-induced psychosis seen clinically since legalization. The findings highlight the need for greater public awareness about cannabis use and its potential mental health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine Spike:&lt;/strong&gt; Cannabis use disorder is linked to increased dopamine in brain regions associated with psychosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imaging Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI revealed darker brain spots indicating excess dopamine in cannabis users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health Concern:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may explain the rise in cannabis-related psychosis and underscore the need for informed cannabis use education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Western University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although it’s been six years since cannabis was legalized in Canada, further research is needed to fully understand its health effects. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published April 9 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on how cannabis use disorder is linked to changes in the brain that are associated with psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109251"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The neuromelanin appears in the scans as black spots, acting as a marker to measure and identify areas with dopamine activity. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using brain imaging techniques, researchers found individuals with cannabis use disorder, those who were using cannabis on a frequent basis over an extended period of time, exhibited signs of higher levels of dopamine in the same region of the brain that is tied to psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted in London, Ont., led by researchers from London Health Sciences Centre Research Institute (LHSCRI) and Western’s Schulich School of Medicine &amp;amp; Dentistry.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous data has shown that in emergency departments across Canada, people have been presenting more often with psychosis after the legalization of cannabis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have evidence that shows a straight line linking cannabis with dopamine and psychosis that has never been shown before, and it’s crucial that clinicians, patients, and families work together to break this line,” said Lena Palaniyappan, adjunct professor at Schulich Medicine &amp;amp; Dentistry, former medical director for LHSC’s Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP) and the senior author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter (a chemical messenger in the brain) that helps process motivation, mood, learning and motor control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Excess levels of dopamine can disrupt normal brain processes and may increase the risk of psychosis, particularly in individuals who are already vulnerable,” said Betsy Schaefer, co-author of the study at LHSCRI and study coordinator at PEPP.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a non-invasive brain imaging technique called neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging, researchers were able to look at a substance called neuromelanin – a black pigment left behind in the brain that accumulates over time if there is too much dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neuromelanin appears in the scans as black spots, acting as a marker to measure and identify areas with dopamine activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In people partaking in excess cannabis use, those spots are blacker than what they should be for their age compared to healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This indicates they have high levels of dopamine, and in some cases are showing pigments someone 10 years older would have,” said Palaniyappan, who is also a professor at McGill University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-one participants aged 18- to 35-years-old were involved in this study. Researchers recruited individuals with and without cannabis use disorder, with some in each group also diagnosed with first-episode schizophrenia, who presented to PEPP at LHSC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw an increase of blacker spots in a particular region of the midbrain associated with psychosis –the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This increase was seen in those with cannabis use disorder regardless of whether they have first-episode schizophrenia,” said Ali Khan, Schulich Medicine &amp;amp; Dentistry professor and scientist at Robarts Research Institute.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;“This research really helps to provide evidence, or the smoking gun, of what we’re seeing clinically and provides clues as to why exposure to cannabis is causing brain changes linked to psychosis.” – Dr. Julie Richard, psychiatrist and physician lead of PEPP at LHSC &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the last several years since legalization, we’re seeing adolescents who have two or three brief cannabis-induced episodes of psychosis and then have a much more major episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, we’re trying to counsel adolescents within that first episode that they’re pushing their brain towards a major episode and show them the areas in the brain that are impacted,” said Richard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaefer explained the new research helps clarify the biological mechanisms connecting cannabis use and mental health risks. The findings underscore the need for awareness, especially as cannabis becomes more widely used since legalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this study encourages further research and informs public health policies to support safe and informed cannabis use.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope these findings lead patients and health-care providers to better understand the implications and for the health-care providers to give patients resources for options other than cannabis to help them cope,” said first author Jessica Ahrens, PhD candidate at McGill University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cannabis use disorder and psychosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.westernu.ca/author/cyi8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cynthia Fazio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.westernu.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Western University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Cynthia Fazio – Western University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2832297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/a&gt;” by Lena Palaniyappan et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence that individuals with a cannabis use disorder (CUD) are at elevated risk of psychosis and that the neurotransmitter dopamine has a role in psychosis, the mechanism linking cannabis use and psychosis remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), referred to as the &lt;em&gt;neuromelanin-MRI signal&lt;/em&gt;, a practical, proxy measure of dopamine function, to assess whether a common alteration in the dopamine system may be implicated in CUD and psychosis and whether this alteration can be observed in those with a CUD whether or not they have a diagnosis of first-episode schizophrenia (FES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal observational cohort study recruited individuals from 2019 to 2023 from an early psychosis service and the surrounding communities in London, Ontario. The sample included individuals with and without CUD, with some in each group also diagnosed with FES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FES and CUD diagnoses from the Structured Clinical Interview for &lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuromelanin-MRI signals within the midbrain (substantia nigra [SN]/ventral tegmental area [VTA]) including a subregion previously linked to the severity of untreated psychosis (a priori region of interest). Linear mixed-effects analyses were performed relating neuromelanin-MRI signals to clinical measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 36 individuals without CUD (mean [SD] age, 22.3 [3.2] years; 29 male [81%]; 12 with FES) and 25 individuals with CUD (mean [SD] age, 24.3 [4.7] years; 22 male [88%]; 16 with FES) participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-year follow-up was completed for 12 individuals with CUD and 25 without CUD. CUD was associated with elevated neuromelanin-MRI signal in a set of ventral SN/VTA voxels (387 of 2060 SN/VTA voxels, corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03, permutation test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CUD was also associated with elevated neuromelanin-MRI signal in the psychosis-related region of interest (&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;92&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.12, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .04) with a significant dose-dependent association (higher burden of CUD symptoms associated with higher neuromelanin-MRI signal, &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1, 96&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.89; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, participants with FES did not exhibit a significant elevation in neuromelanin-MRI signal (241 SN/VTA voxels had elevated signal, corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .09). There was no association between time and neuromelanin-MRI signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated dopamine function in a critical SN/VTA subregion may be associated with psychosis risk in people with CUD.

Cells exposed to typical erythritol levels showed increased oxidative stress and reduced nitric oxide, potentially impairing blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism could help explain previous links between erythritol consumption and higher risks of heart attack and stroke. While marketed as a healthier sugar alternative, experts caution that more research is needed to fully understand erythritol’s long-term vascular effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxidative Stress Trigger:&lt;/strong&gt; Erythritol exposure increases oxidative stress in brain blood vessel cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Nitric Oxide:&lt;/strong&gt; The sweetener lowers nitric oxide production, impairing blood vessel dilation and blood flow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Concerns:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support earlier studies linking erythritol to increased risk of cardiac events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American Physiology Summit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erythritol, a commonly used sugar substitute often marketed as “healthy,” may impair blood vessel health by disrupting the brain’s ability to produce a critical compound, according to new research. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists will present their findings at the 2025 American Physiology Summit in Baltimore.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is a low-calorie sugar substitute found in many sugar-free products, including energy drinks, snack foods and protein bars. Like other sugar alcohols, erythritol is popular because it does not affect blood glucose and insulin levels as much as sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, previous research links consumption of erythritol to a higher risk of adverse cardiac events, including stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers treated human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells—cells from the tiny blood vessels in the brain—with erythritol. They found that the cells exposed to the amount of sweetener in one beverage serving had higher levels of oxidative (cellular) stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the cells produced less nitric oxide, a compound that helps blood vessels dilate. Reduced nitric oxide levels can impair vasodilation, impair blood flow, and may increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While erythritol is widely used in sugar-free products marketed as healthier alternatives, more research is needed to fully understand its impact on vascular health,” said Auburn Berry, a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general, people should be conscious of the amount of erythritol they are consuming on a daily basis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and brain health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ef8a9d809b87af9f87969c868083808896c1809d88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erica Roth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://physiology.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Physiology Summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Erica Roth – American Physiology Summit&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:59:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTFBIbTViOXdmTHRqZng4WjkyZ0IyV2t4elJBdEdxS3I2ZUZfdWhhLVdXY01Ib3ZIN0VhWklWcmtkZXRFN3VwUEtKVW83OWdrUTZBMXRFUEhmdHJXYUxoWUI2R3NUUWtfTmZ3OU5USXdKemlJRzQ</guid></item><item><title>超加工食品可能与早逝有关- BBC | Ultra-processed foods may be linked to early death -

there is little evidence it's down to the processing itself and could be because these foods contain high levels of fat, salt and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;'Artificial ingredients'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers behind the study, published in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00072-8/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, looked at previous research to estimate the impact of ultra-processed food intake on mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study cannot definitively prove that UPFs caused any premature deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is because the amount of ultra-processed foods in someone's diet is also linked to their overall diet, exercise levels, wider lifestyle and wealth, which can all also affect health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The studies looked at surveys of people's diets and at data on deaths from eight countries - Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, UK and US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The report estimates that in the UK and the US, where UPFs account for more than half of calorie intake, 14% of early deaths could be linked to the harms they cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In countries such as Colombia and Brazil, where UPF intake is much lower (less than 20% of calorie intake), the study estimated these foods are linked to around 4% of premature deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Lead study author Dr Eduardo Nilson, from Brazil, said UPFs affected health "because of the changes in the foods during industrial processing and the use of artificial ingredients, including colorants, artificial flavours and sweeteners, emulsifiers, and many other additives and processing aids".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By their calculations, in the US in 2018, there were 124,000 premature deaths due to the consumption of ultra-processed food. In the UK, nearly 18,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study says governments should update their dietary advice to urge people to cut back on these foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the UK government's expert panel on nutrition recently said there wasn't any strong evidence of a link between the way food is processed and poor health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;What is ultra-processed food?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is no one definition that everyone agrees on, but &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldnutritionjournal.org/index.php/wn/article/view/5/4" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the NOVA classification&lt;/a&gt; is often used.

But when numerous studies across many countries and culture suggest UPFs could be a risk to health, Dr Burgess says "ultra-processed foods may be more than a bystander".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said the term 'ultra-processed food' "demonises a wide variety of food that can help people achieve a healthy balanced diet, such as yoghurt, pasta sauces or bread". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It said all additives used by food manufacturers are approved by the Food Standards Agency, who ensure they are safe to eat and drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:47:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5jUm5hazRncUZ4T2JQTDdFMUZLaGlHYW1RU3ZCV25SamctUkwtbHM4VmgySW1BR2hYb1dJVjJtc1A3VGRnbzNwUEE4ZHQ4MHZVa3AxQ2FoMXROd9IBX0FVX3lxTE5FT0diYWFieG1sTGpRU293Z0JYcVhwYlFxemJGb0VvLVh1MDFVUjN4dnE3NEtaUk85d0NNS2NNeFlzbVlSVVowc2diLXJ3Rkt0Q3k4Wmt6NUdoRmI0ellF</guid></item><item><title>我的儿子将他的性取向作为他整个生命的秘密。我害怕它帮助杀了他。-赫芬顿邮报 | My Son Kept His Sexuality A Secret His Whole Life.

When my phone woke me, I saw it was my 23-year-old son, Kyle, calling from the other side of the country at 4 a.m. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a queer person, I thought I had pretty good gaydar, and I imagined my son and I were close, yet his revelation left me open-mouthed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’d never had the slightest inkling Kyle might be gay. He’d always had crushes on girls, starting with little Kathy on his favorite toddler show, ”&lt;/span&gt;Barney &amp;amp; Friends&lt;span&gt;.” He’d pined over girls in middle and high school and worried over the phone with me about his relationships with girls in college. Now he was calling me from Seattle, where he’d moved for love after following a woman from New York. Never once had he expressed sexual interest in men. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I tried to respond with sensitivity and support. Yet I could barely muster any affirming words — especially when Kyle revealed that when he was 16, he’d started arranging online encounters with grown men who met him in a local park for blowjobs. While I fought back my horror over how unaware I’d been that my young son had been meeting with adult predators, Kyle told me he was wondering if he might really have been gay — or maybe bi — all his life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I could not have been more shocked, or so I thought, until the other reason he’d called became clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think maybe I’ve turned to drugs because I’ve been afraid to admit I’m gay,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I soon realized Kyle was calling for help. He’d been arrested for pot and “party drugs,” such as mushrooms and ecstasy, in high school and college, but had seemed to be doing well the prior two years. He now confessed he’d “tried” crack cocaine and become so uncontrollably addicted he’d spent all his student loan money on the drug and was holed up alone in his apartment, high out of his mind after trading away his PlayStation to get more. He was calling because he was afraid he was about to start trading away his roommates’ electronics too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Questions about his sexuality fell by the wayside. I suspected he’d only told me about his attraction to men because that felt easier than announcing his addiction to crack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I found a rehab that would take him, I cried with relief, thinking all of our problems would now be solved. Instead his fellow rehab residents told Kyle about the ultimate high, heroin, which Kyle later told me he “knew immediately” he’d have to try. A friend from long-term rehab helped him shoot up for the first time a year later, and he spent the remainder of his too-short life in and out of rehabs and halfway houses. He died tragically of an overdose of heroin and meth when he was 26. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle was a poet who wrote love sonnets. He was a thoughtful gift-giver who bought the best presents. He earned the highest score of any student in his high school on that year’s SATs. He did children’s theater and stand-up comedy. He loved to play games and beat me at Scrabble nearly every time. He was an extreme romantic who once filled a car with balloons for a girl’s birthday. Yet as Kyle stepped into his role as a young man, he engaged in ever more reckless behaviors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Kyle as a camp counselor when he was 18.

When he got his driver’s license, he drove his car 100 miles an hour up and off a hilly road in order to “catch air,” slamming himself and his best friend into a tree. (Both boys miraculously walked away unharmed, no doubt increasing their belief in their own invincibility.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle was not born a risk taker; he was shy and timid as a toddler. Yet as he grew up, he repeatedly risked his safety to prove how tough he was.

Nearly three-quarters of gay and lesbian people are “out” to family and friends, but fewer than a third of bisexual people are, leaving them isolated and unsupported. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle was a brilliant, sensitive young man, yet what he wanted more than anything was to fit in as one of the guys, which led him to engage in ever-more-troubling behaviors. Indeed, he seemed more concerned with impressing people with his machismo than many of his peers. I now wonder if this was at least partly because of his shame over his sexuality; was he overcompensating to make sure no one suspected?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite all his outrageous, attention-seeking behavior, my son guarded his one secret closely. While publicly dating girls in high school, he was having multiple secret, sexual encounters with grown men, encounters I consider child abuse, but which may have been the only way my son knew to explore his sexuality without anyone finding out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle’s secrecy about his sexuality is even more puzzling because I am queer. I had a girlfriend in high school, then was married to a man for 20 years and am now married to a woman. Kyle’s sister is also queer, an identity Kyle encouraged her to embrace with pride. Our family is about as accepting as a family can be, which made it all the more shocking when Kyle came out to me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, he reminded me during that phone call that I’d idiotically told him and his sister I didn’t believe men &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;could &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;be bisexual, which Kyle explained was why he’d never discussed his sexuality with me. He feared I’d insist he was gay, which he didn’t really think he was. (He wound up concluding that night that he was in fact bi, not gay, though he found “bi” harder to say.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My unknowing rejection of my son’s identity is a mistake I have the rest of my life to regret. But a study published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/31/18369" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68070fe5e4b052543c13cab5" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/31/18369" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;suggests my disbelief is sadly common. The article begins, “There has long been skepticism among both scientists and laypersons that male bisexual orientation exists. Skeptics have claimed men who self-identify as bisexual are actually homosexual or heterosexual. (The existence of female bisexuality has been less controversial.)”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Kyle in his last rehab, less than a year before he died.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo Courtesy Of Lanette Sweeney"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo Courtesy Of Lanette Sweeney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle needed mental health support for the shame society made him feel about being bisexual as much as he did for his addiction, but we only focused on what seemed like the more life-threatening problem, his substance-use disorder. Further, many therapies in rehab are done in groups, and Kyle never felt comfortable discussing his sexuality in those hyper-masculine, gender-segregated rooms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We tried to get Kyle to talk further about this, but he resisted, insisting he was “mostly straight.” He appreciated that I revised my opinion about whether men could be bi, and I told him repeatedly I believed he could have a happy life as either a straight or gay man. (I didn’t realize until I was writing this that even in trying to encourage him, I avoided the word bisexual.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The think-tank &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/invisible-majority.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research I referenced earlier" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68070fe5e4b052543c13cab5" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/invisible-majority.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research I referenced earlier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; shows both gay and straight people have a bias against bisexual people, for whom “stigma, discrimination, and invisibility … create serious negative outcomes.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bias against bisexual men is so bad, only 12% tell those closest to them they are bi. Bisexual youth are more likely to be bullied, to smoke, to drink, to do drugs, to feel hopeless, to be homeless, to have eating disorders, and to be the victims of violence and sexual assault than either gay or straight youth. Bisexual adults are more likely to suffer from mood disorders and poor health, to have a substance-abuse disorder, to be rejected by their families, and to suffer from depression in their older years than either gay or straight adults. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sharing what Kyle kept as his deepest secret feels on the one hand like a betrayal of how he wanted to be perceived. But the more I’ve learned about the hardships faced by bisexual men, especially, the more I’ve come to believe Kyle’s shame around this facet of himself may have been a factor in his early death. My son may have been taught by our culture to feel ashamed of who he was, but in sharing his story, I am saying I will &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;be ashamed of this part of him anymore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ll never know how much Kyle’s feelings about his sexuality contributed to his drug addiction, risk-seeking behaviors or early death by overdose. I wish I could have gotten him to talk to a therapist about his sexuality, and the potentially traumatizing encounters he had with grown men when he was a kid, but I don’t think he ever did. (He was an adult in therapy; I didn’t have much input.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can never undo the damage I did by telling him I didn’t believe bisexual men existed. But I hope other parents reading this will think twice about the messages even supposedly accepting families might be sending their children. I wish I could go back and tell my son instead that he could live a happy, healthy life as a bisexual man. I pray we can all work together to build a world where that is true. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

Researchers tracked neuronal activity in mice and discovered ‘engram-to-be cells’ that synchronize during sleep, preparing to encode new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual role suggests that sleep quality between learning sessions affects both memory retention and the ability to acquire new knowledge. The findings could influence educational practices and treatments for cognitive and memory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Sleep Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep strengthens past memories while preparing neurons for new learning experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engram-to-Be Cells:&lt;/strong&gt; Specialized neurons synchronize during post-learning sleep, setting the stage for future memory formation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanistic Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Synaptic depression and scaling during sleep are crucial for building readiness for future learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Toyama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory formation, storage, and retrieval are fundamental processes that define who we are and how we interact with the world. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the cellular level, these processes rely on specialized neurons called engram cells—neuronal populations that physically encode our experiences and allow us to recall them later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109267"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a woman sleeping." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Their findings revealed that two parallel processes occur during post-learning sleep. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, scientists have made significant progress in identifying these neuronal ensembles and understanding some aspects of memory allocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although sleep is widely known to be essential for memory processing and consolidation, many of its underlying mechanisms and functions are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional views have largely focused on sleep as a backward-looking process that serves to strengthen past experiences, but could it simultaneously help prepare the brain for new learning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent effort to tackle this question, a research team from Japan, led by Distinguished Professor Kaoru Inokuchi from the University of Toyama, uncovered a dual role for sleep in memory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their paper, which will be published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; on April 28, 2025, explores how the brain simultaneously preserves past memories while preparing for future ones during sleep periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was co-authored by Specially Appointed Assistant Professor Khaled Ghandour, also from the University of Toyama; Dr. Tatsuya Haga from the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology; Dr. Noriaki Ohkawa from Dokkyo Medical University; and Professor Tomoki Fukai from OIST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers employed an advanced imaging system that combines live calcium imaging with engram cell labeling, allowing them to track neuronal activity in mice before, during, and after learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach gave them unprecedented insights into how specific populations of neurons behave across different cognitive states, including during sleep periods before and after learning events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings revealed that two parallel processes occur during post-learning sleep. First, engram cells that encoded an initial learning experience showed reactivation patterns—confirming the well-established consolidation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, they also identified a separate population of neurons, which they termed ‘engram-to-be cells,’ that became increasingly synchronized during post-learning sleep. These cells were later shown to encode a new, different learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Engram-to-be cells exhibited increased coactivity with existing engram cells during sleep, suggesting that this interaction helps shape new memory networks,” explains Prof. Inokuchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, the team developed a neural network model simulating hippocampal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model suggested that synaptic depression and scaling, which are mechanisms that adjust connection strengths between neurons during sleep, are essential for the emergence of engram-to-be cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these processes were disabled in the model, the preparation of neurons for future learning was significantly impaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed interesting dynamics between existing engram cells and engram-to-be cells, showing increased co-activation during post-learning sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hints at some form of information transfer or coordination between neural networks representing past and future memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have significant implications for our understanding of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They suggest that the quality of sleep between learning sessions may determine not only how well we remember what we’ve already learned, but also how effectively we can learn new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could influence approaches to education, cognitive enhancement, and the treatment of memory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the research opens new avenues for exploring how sleep disturbances might impact not just memory consolidation but also the brain’s preparedness for future learning challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that manipulating brain activity during sleep or sleep patterns may uncover methods to enhance memory by unlocking the brain’s latent potential,” says Prof. Inokuchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this study underscores the critical role of sleep in maintaining cognitive function and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want people to understand that sleep is not just about rest—it plays a crucial role in how the brain processes information,” Prof. Inokuchi concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With that in mind, we hope everyone will begin to value sleep more and use it as a way to improve their overall quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep, memory, and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#770e1c1603183714031059025a03180e161a16591614591d07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yumiko Kato&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://u-toyama.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Toyama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yumiko Kato – University of Toyama&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58860-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parallel processing of past and future memories through reactivation and synaptic plasticity mechanisms during sleep&lt;/a&gt;” by Kaoru Inokuchi et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallel processing of past and future memories through reactivation and synaptic plasticity mechanisms during sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, we experience new episodes and store new memories. Although memories are stored in corresponding engram cells, how different sets of engram cells are selected for current and next episodes, and how they create their memories, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that in male mice, hippocampal CA1 neurons show an organized synchronous activity in prelearning home cage sleep that correlates with the learning ensembles only in engram cells, termed preconfigured ensembles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, after learning, a subset of nonengram cells develops population activity, which is constructed during postlearning offline periods, and then emerges to represent engram cells for new learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model suggests a potential role of synaptic depression and scaling in the reorganization of the activity of nonengram cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, our findings indicate that during offline periods there are two parallel processes occurring: conserving of past memories through reactivation, and preparation for upcoming ones through offline synaptic plasticity mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:36:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE80N3BmM0JXei04V19oQnhBcXRab3U3OTBGdGxqOTduckh5QzlzX0RZOVJPc3BhMng4Mkcyck5OUzR3a181SFo3N1Y2WEIwZUZKWVpLVDdMZXFoRnMyQmpXak9ZUE9IR0hL</guid></item><item><title>CT扫描会给您带来癌症吗？ -切口 | Will a CT Scan Give You Cancer? - The Cut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQSXFpY212Wi1fOGZueXhibjEwemFhTXBtZDBlTmZmQ0tGa0JUYUg2NmN6OGJ2YnlsQ19fYmYyOW1zYUUzZU03NTloSjJ0TVplZ0tLYjBVdTJMUWJkM3VZakZuU19Pd0Q2eEpDaGdZcmNtVFk4ZmtJVWF4RlhTYkFOSVFodkY5QVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content special-feature" data-editable="content"&gt;

Patients themselves may request CT scans too, if, say, they fear their bad cough could actually be lung cancer or want reassurance that a resected tumor hasn’t reemerged. But here’s the cruel irony: New research shows that these tests, all on their own, are projected to account for 5 percent of new cancers each year. To put that in context, &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/moms-smoke-vape-secret.html"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; leads to 19 percent of cancers, excess weight accounts for about 7 percent of cancers, and &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/alcohol-cancer-risk-surgeon-general.html"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt; makes up 5 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

Children, and especially infants, were at highest risk, though adults made up the bulk of expected cancers — namely of the lung, colon, blood, bladder, and breast — since they get the most scans.&lt;/p&gt;

Plus, rates of CT scans themselves have gone up more than 30 percent since 2007. In the radiologist-researcher’s view, it was time to take a fresh look — and sound a louder alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

In some cases, it’s the most appropriate test for achieving rapid and accurate diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo75l00283b6dxbzmqxdh@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;Both CT scans and, say, conventional radiographs use X-rays, but if you get a chest X-ray because you’re short of breath, for example, you’re taking an image from the front to the back. With CT scanning, you’re in a doughnut-like machine, and the X-rays are delivered around your entire body. By its very nature, it uses more radiation and leads to a lot more information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo75q002c3b6d9f2frmda@published" data-word-count="27"&gt;Just like all medical procedures, CT scans carry risk. Their most notable risk is exposure to ionizing radiation, which is known to increase the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo75o00293b6ds0h8f6y9@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;Nonionizing radiation is used for things like MRI and ultrasound, but you know other sources of nonionizing radiation: your microwave, your cell phone, your cell-phone towers. Ionizing radiation, on the other hand, has enough energy to literally break DNA, so it causes genetic damage. Some of that damage will be repaired, and some of that damage will not be repaired and could lead to subsequent cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo75q002a3b6dj7dy6q5f@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It wasn’t until I saw a picture of a CT scanner that I realized I might have had one for a brain-imaging test. When else are they commonly used? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shape of the CT scanner — looking like a big doughnut — is a lot like the shape of an MRI scanner, which doesn’t use ionizing radiation. So I’ve had many conversations with patients who aren’t sure which one of those tests they had. Even physicians are not always knowledgeable about which test has ionizing radiation and which one doesn’t. So you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo761002d3b6d344wjpgy@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;In the year we looked at, one in five people had gotten a CT scan. So many people get scans, and they get them for many, many reasons. You can use them for trauma situations, be it looking for intracranial bleeding or bleeding in the abdomen, or bone fractures that might be complex — it’s a great test for that. If a patient has a symptom that’s suspicious of cancer, CT scanning is often the first test you use to figure out if it is cancer. It’s also used to do surveillance of cancer to see if a particular treatment is working or not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo75q002b3b6dse9zpaer@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;It’s used across many chronic illnesses like autoimmune disease or diseases of the bowel like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. It’s used to diagnose patients who have kidney stones, to look for vascular abnormalities like a blood clot in the lung, to evaluate patients for a suspected acute stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo765002e3b6da4gndz6s@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;In many scenarios where we use CT scanning, we can either not use a scan at all, or we can replace it with other tests that don’t use ionizing radiation like ultrasound or MRI. But for many indications, it’s absolutely the best test, and we should continue using it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo7c7003g3b6d8scksq7i@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are some people more likely than others to develop cancer from CT scans?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The risk of one CT scan, in general, is not very high. The paper quantifies the risk based on age of exposure, type of scan (like head versus abdomen), and other factors. While we can’t say how much a single scan raises any individual’s risk, our figures do show that there’s about one cancer per 50 CTs in girls who get scanned before age 1, for example, and one cancer per 400 CTs in women ages 18 to 29.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76p002k3b6dem6rroup@published" data-word-count="44"&gt;But some patients have genetic syndromes that make them particularly at risk of developing cancer when exposed to radiation. Some of them you most certainly have heard of — Down syndrome and BRCA carriers — but there are lots of others, like Lynch syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo776002p3b6du38y9lyb@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;So a patient reached out to me. She has a new colon-cancer diagnosis and had an offer to participate in a trial testing a new medication that looks super promising. But part of the protocol requires her to have seven CT scans over a short period of time. She has Lynch syndrome, and she’s had many cancers because of this syndrome. So she’s between a rock and a hard place. In those cases, it’s hard for me to see the value of those scans, and I could definitely see the harm of those scans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76c002h3b6dpoonqfn6@published" data-word-count="20"&gt;It’s really important to think about every scan. &lt;em&gt;Do I need this scan? How is it going to help me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76t002m3b6dcqsia32y@published" data-word-count="29"&gt;Patients need to have informed conversations with their health-care providers about the necessity of every scan and whether alternative imaging options like ultrasound or MRI might be more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s estimated that a third or more of all medical scans are not necessary. That’s a lot of scans that we could be avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76u002n3b6df7wpm5ch@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s driving all of these unnecessary scans? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Physicians are incredibly strapped for time, and it’s easier sometimes to order a test than to sit down and spend as much time with the patient discussing the need for the test. It would also be disingenuous to not acknowledge that medical imaging is a very profitable part of the health-care system, and one of the drivers of scanning is that it brings in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76z002o3b6drdckc0ab@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;Sometimes the desire to get imaging comes from the patient, who feels that having the image is a reflection of really high-quality care. Even if the clinician has informed them that the likelihood of finding an actionable finding is extremely low, they still might want to get the CT scan because they want to be sure that their headache doesn’t reflect a brain cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77e002r3b6d2yw5rtk0@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;I know brain cancer — I lost a kid sister to brain cancer — I understand that anxiety very well. But if someone wants to get a scan just to reassure them that everything’s normal, they should understand that that scan comes with a small risk of cancer. So they’re looking for a needle in a haystack, and … they could be causing the cancer that they’re hoping to get reassurance about.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76s002l3b6d1bwoi0uz@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the rise of sort of “advocacy TikTok” has anything to do with the surge in scanning? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I fully support patients advocating for themselves, but they need to do so with information. I don’t think anyone’s advocating for themselves to have, let’s say, surgical exploration of their body to look for hidden cancer. That would be crazy. Obviously, surgery is fantastic in the right setting, but to just look around through surgery makes no sense. The same thing is true with medical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo7c8003h3b6dgsuxy34k@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;We have a website at UCSF called &lt;a href="https://knowyourdose.ucsf.edu/"&gt;Know Your Dose&lt;/a&gt;, and it shows patients how to advocate for themselves, how not to question the doctor’s authority, but to work with them to get both fewer tests as well as something we have not touched on yet: lower doses per test.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo7e4003i3b6dvd9hk6p3@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So some CT scans have lower doses of radiation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patients may assume that no matter where they go for a CT scan, they get the same dose. That’s not the case. Radiation doses are extremely variable — up to 20 times stronger at one facility than another — depending on where the patient goes for care.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77f002s3b6de3aaiwuq@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;UCSF was awarded a cooperative agreement with Medicare to develop a quality measure that judges the doses for CT scans to try to help incentivize physicians to lower them. That quality measure — it’s called &lt;a href="https://ecqi.healthit.gov/ecqm/eh/2025/cms1074v2?qt-tabs_measure=measure-information"&gt;excessive radiation dose&lt;/a&gt; — was rolled out, as an optional program, this year in hospitals and outpatient clinics across the country. For patients who really care about this topic, they should ask their doctors to send them to a place that has adopted this measure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77m002w3b6dnfu82lfe@published" data-word-count="42"&gt;Patients should also ask their doctors, “Where should I go? Where are they going to ensure I receive the lowest dose?” And, when they get a scan, patients can further ask the technologist, “Can you do that scan with a lower dose?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77n002x3b6dcartq5bo@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does lowering the dose actually mean for the clinician? Are they seeing a less clear picture? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a really interesting question. If you’re talking about a radiograph and an X-ray in the chest that we mentioned earlier, there’s a very close relationship between the size of the dose you use and how the image looks. So if you use too much, you can’t see; the image gets unreadable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77k002u3b6dp91mu2aq@published" data-word-count="13"&gt;If you use too little, it’s unreadable. So there’s a narrow sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78800323b6dy74xngos@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;For CT scanning, however, there’s a very, very wide sweet spot, all at the high-dose range. But your point is well taken — we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; push it down too low. The quality measure that I mentioned includes a balancing component to make sure that doses don’t go too low.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77w002z3b6d9a7gmb40@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;The problem is not just selecting the dose — it’s the approach for setting the dose. The CT scanners look a little bit like a fighter-pilot console with all these buttons, and the manufacturers have not even standardized the approach to use to lower the dose. For one method, you raise the dial to get a lower dose, and for the other, you lower the dial.&lt;/p&gt;

If you go to a particular hospital, there may be 500 different ways to program that CT scan for a head scan, and there should be three or four.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo7ec003j3b6dn1yyuyhw@published" data-word-count="54"&gt;This work, to standardize CT use and dosing protocols, has to be done, and there are publications and people who have done it. Our team ran a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2763413?resultClick=1"&gt;randomized trial&lt;/a&gt; where we showed across 100 hospitals in the U.S., we could lower doses by 40 percent by giving feedback to hospitals on how they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78v003b3b6dqxv865wz@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;There are also many examples of physician groups that are leading the way to address CT overuse, offering models for improving patient safety and care. A pediatric oncologist at UCSF published a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18465805/"&gt;pivotal paper in 2008&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the risk of frequent surveillance CT scans in pediatric oncology patients. Many of these children were cured with chemotherapy, then faced an unnecessary increased risk of radiation-induced cancer due to repeated imaging. Totally tragic.&lt;/p&gt;

They significantly reduced the number of scans that children had to undergo, and they favored using safer alternatives like MRI, ultrasound, and plain X-rays. That’s the kind of thoughtful, evidence-based reassessment that’s key to safer imaging that we need to see more of.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78900333b6dd7yd3yh8@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With every new headline about a carcinogen, people say, “Everything causes cancer these days!” How do you respond? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s very hard. We’re bombarded with information about what does or doesn’t cause cancer. But seeing that the magnitude of this association is the same as the other risk factors — obesity, alcohol consumption — should help people see this is not a small thing. This is a big thing.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not discouraging people from eating broccoli. I’m a big fan of eating broccoli. But we’re talking about really small things. Radiation is a really big thing.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve gotten a CT scan. My children have gotten CT scans. I’ve both agreed to some CT scans and not agreed to others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78g00373b6dg9iv9bq2@published" data-word-count="90"&gt;My youngest son, at one point, fell out of a tree, hit his head, and started falling asleep at the dinner table. We took him to the emergency room, and he got a CT scan. He didn’t have a bleed, and that was the right test to do. When we were leaving the emergency department, they said, “Let’s do one more CT to make sure it’s still nothing.” My husband said, “Can’t we just watch him and make sure he’s okay?” So we accepted one, and we didn’t accept one.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re in the past. There’s nothing you can do about them — there’s no way you can counterbalance them with any potent serum or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

So the more time that has passed since that scan, the risk of cancer goes down. But risk does depend on overall exposure, so limiting future exposure will lower your risk, and if you have one and avoid the second, that will give you a lower risk too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78c00363b6di4k63f2o@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;The more activated patients are, and the more activated their physicians are,  that’s the thing that’s going to help push radiologists to start really focusing on lowering the doses and lowering the use.&lt;/p&gt;

These encompass dietary habits, physical activity levels, smoking status, and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2021-part-2/adult-health-cholesterol" rel="nofollow"&gt;NHS England Digital&lt;/a&gt; reports that a concerning 59% of adults in England have elevated total cholesterol. High cholesterol typically doesn't present any noticeable symptoms, earning it the ominous moniker of a 'silent killer'. The only way to determine if you're affected is through a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-top-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol levels are detrimental as they can lead to plaque build-up in the arteries, resulting in a condition known as atherosclerosis. This can increase the risk of serious health complications like heart disease, stroke, and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes is another alarming health concern, as persistently high blood sugar levels can cause severe and potentially fatal complications affecting various organs and systems within the body. These complications can include heart disease, stroke, nerve damage, kidney disease, eye issues, and foot problems, reports &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/what-cardiovascular-dietitian-eats-prevents-31524101%22" rel="nofollow"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mce-linkchecker-status="valid"&gt;To combat high cholesterol and reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes, it's crucial to adopt a heart-healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and make lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and moderating alcohol consumption. This involves cutting back on saturated and trans fats, increasing your fibre intake, and incorporating healthy fats into your meals. Your doctor may also suggest medication like statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/welcome/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;UC Davis Health&lt;/a&gt;'s esteemed dietitian, Margie Junker, with a special focus on cardiovascular nutrition, has shared her top recommendations for avoiding heart disease. She dishes out seven food suggestions, alongside pointers on what to shun for optimal cardiac wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="jw-player-container"&gt;&lt;h3 class="jw-player-title"&gt;High cholesterol: Nutritionist reveals top prevention tips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Plenty of fruits and vegetables&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junker champions the consumption of abundant fruits and vegetables. Her personal choices include: "My favourite is blueberries because they're a great snack, either fresh or frozen. I also love how easy spinach is to use. You can use fresh spinach as a salad or quickly sauté with garlic and onions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She identifies a fruit and veg-rich diet as crucial for lowering heart disease risk. Whether they are dried, fresh, frozen, or low in sodium if canned, all are beneficial. However, she cautions against certain items: "I avoid canned fruit in heavy syrup and any foods with high fructose corn syrup."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="wunderkind-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Whole grains rather than refined grains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For grains, whole options trump refined versions every time, according to Junker. She shares her preferred choices: "My favourite grains to eat are quick oats and quinoa. Both are whole grains and easy to cook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She then warns against specific unhealthy alternatives: "I stay away from foods containing processed white flour because there are fewer nutrients and no fibre."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whatsapp-group "&gt; &lt;strong class="wapp-head"&gt; Get seasonal recipes and cooking inspiration straight to your phone &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="wapp-btn" href="https://www.express.co.uk/whatsapp-group-web/12?utm_source=article_widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_widget&amp;amp;utm_content=whatsapp-group-signup-in-article"&gt;Join us on WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wapp-inf"&gt;Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

Healthy sources of protein&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plant protein:&lt;/strong&gt; "I love to eat a serving of nuts daily. Walnuts and almonds are known for their omega 3 fatty acids. A quarter cup of nuts makes a great snack. Eating more nuts was associated with lower risk of heart disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Lentils are high in fibre, high in protein, easy to cook, and may cause less gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort than beans. A higher intake of legumes (beans and peas) is linked to lower heart disease risk," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fish and seafood:&lt;/strong&gt; "My favourites are salmon or seared ahi tuna because they are high in protein, have fewer calories and contain healthy heart Omega 3 fatty acids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-fat or fat-free dairy products:&lt;/strong&gt; "My favourite is non-fat Greek yoghurt because of its versatility. It's high in protein, has a lot of calcium, and can replace sour cream in many recipes. It's a great breakfast option, stirred with quick oats and berries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lean cuts of meat and poultry:&lt;/strong&gt; "There is a direct association between eating red meat and the risk of heart disease and death. That relationship is even stronger for processed meat such as bacon or hot dogs. Instead of processed meats, I often choose skinless chicken thighs. It's leaner than most beef, affordable and has more flavour than chicken breast, which I get tired of. I avoid processed meats. What's in it? It's a mystery! I also steer clear of full-fat dairy products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.avif?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.webp?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.jpg?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.avif?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.webp?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.jpg?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.avif?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.webp?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.jpg?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.avif?r=1745845154414" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.webp?r=1745845154414" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.jpg?r=1745845154414" alt="Whole wheat pasta" title="Whole wheat pasta" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;The dietitian avoids choosing and preparing foods high in salt &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Liquid plant oils&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health guru steers clear of fats that remain solid at room temperature, such as bacon grease, shortening, and margarine. She also shuns tropical oils (coconut, palm, and palm kernel), animal fats (butter and lard), and partially hydrogenated fats. However, she occasionally utilises small quantities of coconut oil or butter to enhance the flavour of certain dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her preferred choice is avocado oil. "It has a high smoke point at 520 degrees", she noted. "I like to bake with walnut oil for added flavour. Liquid plant oils are rich in unsaturated fats, which reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and heart disease risk. These include oils from peanuts, most tree nuts, and flax seeds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Foods with limited salt and added sugars&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margie Junker opts for dried herb blends, fresh herbs, and citrus to boost the natural flavours of foods. Explaining her minimal use of salt (sodium), she states: "There is a direct relationship between increased salt intake and high blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to healthily satisfying a sweet craving, the dietician shares: "I love using maple syrup in my coffee and oatmeal. I also sweeten with small amounts of local honey. I avoid any chemically based sweeteners and processed white sugar. Added sugars are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and being overweight. Alternative sweeteners have shown mixed effects on metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.avif?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.webp?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.avif?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.webp?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.avif?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.webp?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.avif?r=1745845154426" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.webp?r=1745845154426" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426" class="zoomEnabled" data-img="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426" alt="Woman cooking artichokes in frying pan" title="Woman cooking artichokes in frying pan" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;The health expert opts for whole grains rather than refined grains &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="magnifier" data-img="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Limited alcohol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dietician recommends: "Water with a splash of lemon or cucumber is a great option for added flavour. If you don't drink alcohol, don't start. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit your intake. The risk of atrial fibrillation (A-fib) and of stroke increases with increased alcohol intake. Stroke and coronary heart disease are lowest in those who drink 1-2 alcoholic beverages daily."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Staying active and eating right&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emphasising the importance of an active lifestyle combined with a nutritious diet, the secret to maintaining a healthy weight lies in balancing the two. Achieve the perfect energy balance by matching a healthful eating plan with a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dietician points out that sound nutrition isn't about extreme calorie cuts or embracing a diet high in saturated fats, as popularised by regimes like the Keto diet. Rather, it's about savouring fresh, whole, plant-based foods that are seasonal, providing crucial vitamins and minerals that support overall health and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>这种韩国饮食有望在4周内减少脂肪，而不会损伤肌肉：将其添加到日常生活中的简单方法-印度时报 | This Korean diet promises fat loss in 4 weeks without muscle damage: Easy ways to add it to your daily ro - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle damage is one of the key side effects of weight loss that many of us are not aware of. When you lose weight too fast or don’t eat right, your body can start burning muscle instead of just fat. Muscle isn’t just about looking toned; it keeps your metabolism strong, helps you burn more calories, and keeps you feeling energetic. If you’re not getting enough protein or you’re doing extreme dieting, muscle loss can sneak up on you. You want to lose fat, not the good stuff your body needs! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Korean diet is going viral over social media for every right reason. The Switch-On diet, designed by Dr. Park Yong-Woo, is being adopted by many people because of its role in fat burning and not damaging the muscles. The diet pattern centres around intermittent fasting, protein rich meals with special emphasis on gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what exactly is the Korean Switch-On diet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, it’s about switching up the way you eat — not just cutting out calories, but focusing on the right types of food to fuel your body for fat loss while preserving muscle. It’s a diet that’s based on traditional Korean eating habits, which are naturally rich in whole foods, fermented items like kimchi, and lots of veggies and lean protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Have you ever experienced muscle loss during a weight loss journey?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of this diet are whole foods that promote fat loss, such as lean proteins (think chicken, fish, tofu), vegetables, and healthy carbs like sweet potatoes or brown rice. The diet encourages eating more fermented foods (a staple in Korean cuisine) like kimchi and miso, which are not only good for gut health but also for overall digestion. These foods help regulate your metabolism, reduce bloating, and prevent that sluggish feeling that often comes with restrictive diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this approach so effective is that it focuses on nutrient-dense foods that support your metabolism, help balance your hormones, and prevent muscle loss while burning fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Focus on protein intake and workout in the first week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first week focus on having protein drinks 4 times a day, take probiotics on an empty stomach in the morning and walk for 60 minutes a day. After 3 days you can reduce protein intake to 3 times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Focus on intermittent fasting in the second week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor recommends starting the second week with a cup of black coffee in the morning and cutting down protein drinks to only twice a day. "Do a 24-hour fast once a week. Instead of fasting for 24 hours starting at midnight, fast from an early dinner to an afternoon snack the next day, and then eat dinner normally," he recommends. "On fasting days, avoid high-intensity exercise, but exercise at a moderate level will be more effective. After fasting, eat a hearty, low-carb meal," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fast twice a week in the third week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor recommends fasting for 24 hours in the third week, but not on two consecutive days. "You should eat a high-protein meal after fasting to prevent muscle loss. After completing week 3, if your muscle mass has recovered to the level of the day you started the diet, proceed to week 4. If not, do it again," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fast thrice a week in the fourth week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last week of the diet, the doctor recommends eating low-carb meals for both lunch and dinner and drinking protein rich drinks for twice a day. "Fast for 24 hours three times a week, but do not do them consecutively," he recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to add this diet to daily routine in easy steps:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kick off your mornings with a good source of protein. Try scrambled eggs, a smoothie with protein powder, or a bowl of Greek yogurt topped with fruit and nuts. This helps keep you full longer, gives you energy, and prevents muscle loss while you’re burning fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporate a serving of fermented foods into your lunch. Fermented foods are key to the Korean diet because they support digestion and gut health. A simple bowl of raita with your regular lunch will do wonders!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Include healthy fats in your meals. A drizzle of olive oil on your salad, a handful of nuts, or some avocado on toast will help keep you satisfied between meals and support fat burning. Don’t skip the fats — they’re good for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein should be part of your snacks to help maintain muscle and keep cravings at bay. Grab a handful of nuts, a small piece of grilled chicken, or even a boiled egg to snack on between meals. This helps avoid overeating and keeps your energy stable throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is all about slowing down and enjoying your food. No more scarfing down meals on the go! Take the time to chew slowly, savor each bite, and listen to your body when it tells you it’s full. This helps with digestion and keeps you from overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods not to include in the switch-on diet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When following a healthy eating plan or diet, it’s important to steer clear of several food categories. Avoid sugar-laden products like soft drinks, snacks, candies, and desserts, as well as milk with added sugars or soy milk. Flour-based foods like bread, cake, and pasta should also be limited. Alcohol, regardless of type, is best avoided entirely. Foods high in saturated fat (pork belly, ribs) and trans fats (cookies, fried foods) should be kept to a minimum.

It typically causes diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting that gets better naturally within a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, however, it can be life-threatening for vulnerable groups, including young children, the elderly and immunosuppressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study could not prove that the bug is directly responsible for rising rates of the disease, researchers said campylobacter jejuni may put the public at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as Italian scientists last week discovered that regularly eating chicken could double your risk of dying from 11 different types of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-5f3b3790-21bc-11f0-9fa1-878caa005253" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, including colon and stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those that consumed over 300g of poultry — equivalent to about four portions — per week, had double the risk of dying from a digestive cancer, compared to those who are&lt;span&gt; less than one portion of poultry per week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Supermarkets must report data on the prevalence of campylobacter among their poultry products every three months so the FSA can monitor food quality. They share the proportion of their raw roasting chickens which have more than 1,000 colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g) of campylobacter. At this level, chickens are considered highly contaminated and carry a risk of food poisoning. Retailers are supposed to ensure that no more than seven per cent of their chickens breach this levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Colon cancer, long considered a disease of old age, is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14631623/doctor-five-signs-colon-cancer-rise-Gen-Z-Millennials.html"&gt;increasingly striking people in their 20s, 30s and 40s&lt;/a&gt; in a phenomenon that has baffled doctors around the world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the new study, US researchers tracked over 70 patients with the disease and compared campylobacter jejuni levels in their digestive system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over a follow-up of three years they found a higher number of campylobacter jejuni in the 34 patients whose cancer had spread to other parts of the body, compared to the 37 which had not. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(24)00437-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1931312824004372%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell Host &amp;amp; Microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, they said the toxin cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), often found in campylobacter jejuni strains, may be behind the cancer's rapid acceleration because it causes DNA damage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professor Christian Jobin, an expert in cancer microorganisms at the University of Florida and study co-author, added: 'These findings confirmed that CDT is essential for the bacteria's role in promoting cancer spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'When bacteria that produce CDT move to tumours outside the gut, it appears to accelerate the spread of these tumours.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tests on mice with human colon cancer tissue also found that CDT accelerated the spread of colon cancer tumours to other parts of the body, the researchers said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But further human studies are needed to confirm this direct link.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bowel cancer can cause you to have blood in your poo, a change in bowel habit, a lump inside your bowel which can cause an obstructions. Some people also suffer with weight loss a s a result of these symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Latest UK data shows campylobacter laboratory confirmed cases have surged, with a 27 per cent rise logged between 2022 and 2024. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, supermarkets must report figures on the prevalence of campylobacter among their poultry products every three months so Food Standards Agency (FSA) officials can monitor food quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They share the proportion of their raw chickens which have more than 1,000 colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g) of campylobacter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this level, chickens are considered contaminated and carry a higher risk of food poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from the misery and pain of the illness itself, the FSA estimates the bacteria costs the economy some £900million a year in terms of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-eab22c20-240f-11f0-bcd2-1b1a3144889c" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; treatment and lost days at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid food poisoning, people should make sure they cook chicken thoroughly, separate meat from other foods, keep it in the fridge and wash their hands and utensils after touching raw meat, according to the FSA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chicken should also not be washed because it may splash bacteria elsewhere in the kitchen, it added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as Italian scientists last week suggested eating chicken multiple times a week could double your risk of dying from 11 different types of cancer including colon. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rates of a rare strain of the bug E.coli — known as non-0157 shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC) — have risen almost 10-fold in England in just seven years &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, Italian scientists analysed diet and health information of nearly 5,000 people, mostly in their 50s, over almost two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suggested chicken proteins exposed to high temperatures during cooking may form chemicals that can harm human cells, triggering changes that could develop into cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found those that consumed over 300g of poultry — equivalent to about four portions — per week, had double the risk of dying from a digestive cancer, compared to those who are&lt;span&gt; less than one portion of poultry per week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It could also be the result of feed given to poultry, or hormones or medications animals may be exposed to during the rearing process, the experts added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other recent research has also suggested food poisoning bug helicobacter pylori may too raise the risk of colon cancer by altering the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and certain E. coli strains, have also been strongly linked to an increased risk of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerning research last week suggested E.coli may be to blame for a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14215241/doctors-reveal-tragic-young-people-colon-cancer.html"&gt;disturbing rise in colon cancer cases in under 50s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;US researchers analysed the DNA of 981 colon cancer tumours in patients aged either under 40 or over 70, across 11 countries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They found traces of colibactin, a cancer-linked toxin produced by certain strains of &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/e-coli/index.html" id="mol-13f00d30-21e2-11f0-9fa1-878caa005253"&gt;E.

This is a powerful glycaemic medication which is going to help you lower your blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“There was a perception of it as a weight-loss drug, that I had to reframe and bring back to the people coming in here to start with it as a diabetes medication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She added: “As an indication of how it works, that it helps people to lose weight, it became popular for that — but never lose sight of what it was traditionally intended for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Diabetes and obesity are rampant in Bermuda, and the reputation of the various drugs for helping people to lose weight attests to their efficacy at reining in type 2 diabetes, a disease largely driven by lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-factbox desktop hidden"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;How bad is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Figures and statistics on diabetes and obesity in the Chief Medical Officer’s&lt;a href="https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/Chief%20Medical%20Officer%E2%80%99s%20Annual%20Report%202023.pdf" id="link-8f73a557e26e6cd3748bf0a5bf1f5125" target="_blank"&gt; annual report &lt;/a&gt;for 2023 paint a grim picture of their impact on the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Insurance claims related to diabetes for the financial year 2020-21 topped $3.5 million, with obesity payouts at more than $650,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The report showed 38.4 per cent of people aged 35 to 64 were classed as obese in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The Black population was worst-hit, at 36.8 per cent, compared with 30.3 per cent of the White population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-factbox-mobile d-lg-none"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;How bad is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Figures and statistics on diabetes and obesity in the Chief Medical Officer’s&lt;a href="https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/Chief%20Medical%20Officer%E2%80%99s%20Annual%20Report%202023.pdf" id="link-8f73a557e26e6cd3748bf0a5bf1f5125" target="_blank"&gt; annual report &lt;/a&gt;for 2023 paint a grim picture of their impact on the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Insurance claims related to diabetes for the financial year 2020-21 topped $3.5 million, with obesity payouts at more than $650,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The report showed 38.4 per cent of people aged 35 to 64 were classed as obese in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The Black population was worst-hit, at 36.8 per cent, compared with 30.3 per cent of the White population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Bosch de Noya told &lt;em id="emphasis-e584d6b29de011c839548cfddd0d8df9"&gt;The Royal Gazette&lt;/em&gt;: “Any effective diabetes medication, as any endocrinologist would tell you, has to have an outcome of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“If a diabetes drug, which we had 20, 30 years ago, was good at lowering glucose levels but caused weight gain, at the end of the day it’s only going to increase insulin resistance and not make the diabetes outcome better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“But when people realised that these new classes of drug cause weight loss, it activated everybody’s interest in using these drugs for weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Drugs such as Ozempic can be far from perfect, as a 54-year-old Black man who struggled over decades to shed excess pounds attested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“I lost five pounds over two, three years, but it was weird,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“It made chicken taste funny, so I couldn’t eat chicken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;His interest in drinking alcohol also vanished — but in ways that felt “strange”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“It was like that was removed as an option for me to have,” he said. “Towards the end, I started to have stomach pains, so I just quit it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Most patients get started with Ozempic, according to Ms Bosch de Noya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Those who react badly could get switched up to Mounjaro, which she described as “a slightly ramped-up version — the main difference is that it activates two gut hormones that regulate blood sugars, whereas Ozempic is just one”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She added: “We’re seeing a few that might get switched to Mounjaro, particularly people who don’t tolerate Ozempic, where they might have some nausea or gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“There are anecdotal cases I’ve seen with patients where they’ve switched to Mounjaro and don’t have those same symptoms. It’s still a once-a-week drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Bermuda’s health insurers vary, but Mr Lozier spelt out the Argus approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Ozempic is approved to treat type 2 diabetes, reduce heart risks in people with diabetes and heart disease, and, starting in 2025, help slow kidney disease in those with diabetes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Its active ingredient, semaglutide, is exactly the same as that contained in another drug, Wegovy — but only the latter, approved for weight loss, is covered by the insurer, which adheres to the book when it comes to deciding coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;In that regard, Mr Lozier said that Ozempic, if prescribed for weight loss without a medical diagnoses, would not be covered under the company’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Bosch de Noya said she supported such vetting of payment by insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“People who have diabetes, generally there isn’t an issue with it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Some of the insurance companies may require more of pre-authorisation, particularly with Mounjaro, because it’s more expensive. And rightly so — there should be some level of pre-authorisation with both of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Regardless, Mr Lozier said, the island’s demand for the medications was increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Monthly use of the drugs “surged by nearly 600 per cent between 2020 and 2023 for individuals under 25, and 300 per cent for those over 25”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Mr Lozier said the monthly cost for Ozempic in Bermuda ranged from $936 to $1,300, “significantly higher than in regulated markets”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The company estimated the annual cost per patient at about $10,00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Mr Lozier said generic versions of the drugs stood to bring down costs “significantly”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;He added: “However, a generic version of Ozempic isn’t expected in the US until late 2031 or early 2032.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“In Canada, the semaglutide patent expires in January 2026, and several companies are expected to launch generics. Pending approval, these could lower the monthly costs by more than 50 per cent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Annabel Fountain, an endocrinologist with many years of experience with the medications, questioned Argus’s figures for cost, maintaining that she had seen substantially cheaper deals for the treatment described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Her advice to patients was: “Call around and see how much it costs elsewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Dr Fountain said use of the drugs was best undertaken with education on nutrition and a study of individual body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said their results were “amazing” when properly deployed with attention to diet and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Seventy-four per cent of us are overweight or obese,” Dr Fountain said. “The biggest health problem we have in Bermuda is diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Oncologists and cardiologists will agree. If we could prevent people from becoming obese or developing diabetes, we would have significantly less cancer or heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Dr Fountain said the weight loss triggered by the drugs could be a catalyst for the lifestyle changes required to eventually come off them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“If your knees hurt when you’re 250 pounds, it’s hard to exercise,” she said. “But if you were to lose 50 pounds, it’s easier to exercise. It becomes a positive snowball effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Dr Fountain agreed that the emergence of cheaper, generic versions of the drugs held some promise for cutting costs, but said pricing on the island needed to be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“If a wholesaler brings it in, and it only costs them $10, they can still charge people $100 for it — there’s no regulation at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said the development of a national drug formulary similar to Britain’s, now under way in Bermuda, would bring much needed precision to the prescription of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She added: “Potentially, there will be regulation in the future of the price of medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Bosch de Noya, whose focus is on diabetes, said she was optimistic that the medications could help to turn the tide on a host of chronic and debilitating diseases linked to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Are we winning the war on it yet?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“That still remains an outcome for us to watch and wait for, but that’s our hope — that with the improved outcomes, we will certainly see less of the devastating complications that we used to see with diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now, he’s at a turning point. - Chicago Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE9Vb2JsN1NxVVpOSUdzRTd0bGVBX1ZuOGluN1NjMVFxMTZ5MzVzZUkxNUFrWVo5Q0MzRENTNlQ1VWV2SjlocTVLalVyYkZGRUpZd245cGdSN2xTc0NxT3hqRmszVllTYmprUEo1RUVhMHY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost exactly a year after he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, WGN-TV reporter Mike Lowe’s cell phone pinged as he drove to work early last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a message from his doctor — the results of his latest colonoscopy, a test meant to show whether six weeks of radiation and four months of chemotherapy had worked. The results were exactly what he had hoped to see: The cancer was no longer detectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting those results, it was just the most amazing feeling,” Lowe said. “I think back to one year ago, when I went to the initial doctor’s appointment … .In some ways it feels like forever and in some ways it feels like the blink of an eye — but what a year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a year that started with surprise at his diagnosis at the age of 44. Lowe’s surprise, however, quickly turned into a conviction that he would use his platform as a television news reporter to raise awareness about the disease, which has increasingly been striking people at younger ages. For the past year, he’s&lt;a href="https://wgntv.com/video/i%e2%80%99m-going-try-to-go-into-this-cancer-fight-as-strong-as-i-can-possibly-be-wgns-mike-lowe-shares-health-journey/10200561/"&gt; taken WGN viewers along on his journey&lt;/a&gt;, talking about his diagnosis in news segments, inviting cameras into his appointments and procedures and sharing  very personal details about his experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a public health crisis in this country where younger and younger people are being diagnosed with colorectal cancer,” Lowe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 20% of colorectal cases were in people ages 54 or younger in 2019 — almost double the percentage as in 1995, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists aren’t sure exactly what’s causing the increase in diagnoses among younger patients, but they’re urging people to see their doctors if they experience unusual symptoms such as abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, diarrhea, bloody stools or constipation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth-most common type of cancer in the U.S., according to the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a journalist, Lowe felt it was his duty to share his experience with viewers.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“It’s my job to ask people about some of the worst experiences they have in their lives and be open and honest about it,” said Lowe, who’s won 39 Emmy Awards. “How I could do that for a living, and then when something like this happens to me, not be open and honest with the public about my own story?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe, who grew up in Evanston, knew he wanted to be a journalist from an early age. He attended Northwestern University before taking a series of broadcast jobs across the country. He earned a spot at WGN about a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe is a “born storyteller,” said Dominick Stasi, news director at WGN-TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s probably the best storyteller that I’ve ever worked with, and when it came time for this journey that he was going on … he saw this as a way for him to tell his story and also educate people,” Stasi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The diagnosis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Lowe was diagnosed with cancer about a year ago, he now realizes that the disease had been building for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About five years ago, Lowe began experiencing concerning symptoms, such as blood in his bowel movements. He knew he had a family history of the illness, because his grandfather had colon cancer. Lowe went to his general practitioner at the time, who recommended a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I fumbled the ball,” said Lowe, a huge Chicago sports fan. “She gave me the referral and I just never made the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

(Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s indicative of especially a lot of young men who are apprehensive about a colonoscopy,” Lowe said, adding that, “I guess you’re also worried about what they might find.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years later, he had a new doctor. He told the new doctor he was ready to get the colonoscopy and asked for another referral. That doctor, however, told him he’d get a colonoscopy when he was 45, Lowe said. The &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening"&gt;U.S. Preventative Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt; lowered the age at which it recommends most patients be regularly screened for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45 in 2021, partly in response to more younger people developing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe moved on. He was still having some constipation and a little abdominal pain, but he was an otherwise healthy guy in his early 40s. He did triathlons and was known among friends and colleagues for his energy, humor and positivity. He jokes now that he thought, at the time, that maybe he just needed to lay off the Mexican fast food and eat more kale salads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by February of last year, he could no longer ignore his escalating symptoms. He had blood in every bowel movement and felt like he couldn’t empty his bowels all the way. One night he ended up in an emergency room with stabbing abdominal pain. He waited for a few hours but started feeling better and left without being seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he told his mom about the episode, she was alarmed and insisted he make an appointment with his doctor — in front of her. She watched as he sent a message over his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe got an appointment, and the doctor did a rectal exam. Almost immediately, he was fairly sure that Lowe had cancer. A colonoscopy soon confirmed the doctor’s suspicion. Lowe had stage 3 colorectal cancer. The cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not yet to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll always have in the back of my mind, ‘Man, I wonder if I had had a colonoscopy back then if we would have caught this as a polyp instead of stage 3 cancer,’” Lowe said of his earlier visits to doctors. “What I later learned is you really have to advocate for yourself if you think there’s something wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sharing his battle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, Lowe faced a winding path of medical appointments, treatments and side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he started with radiation. He had about 30 rounds of radiation treatments over six weeks. The worst side effects, he said, were fatigue toward the end and a burning sensation during urination. “Radiation is a lot easier on the body today than it was 20 or 30 years ago,” Lowe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also making radiation a little easier was the patient in line before him each day: famed former Cubs player Ryne Sandberg, who has been battling prostate cancer. As a child, Lowe had a poster of Sandberg on his bedroom wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ended up spending a lot of time together, talking about everything from radiation side effects to the Rolling Stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was unbelievable to me because he was one of my childhood heroes,” Lowe said. “To see one of your heroes like that, in that context, it was surreal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowe would get radiation treatments early in the morning and then head to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were certain setbacks, but he just tackled each and every one of them and wanted to keep working as much as he could,” said Stasi  of WGN. “He approached the whole thing with a positive attitude. It was really kind of inspiring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe also continued working through his chemotherapy, which took a heavier toll on him than radiation. The side effects of chemotherapy intensified as the weeks went on. He experienced nausea, numbness in his hands and feet, and the skin on his feet and palms peeled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, he developed sores in his mouth and throat, as part of a condition called mucositis, which he described as akin to the worst case of strep throat he’s ever had — times two. He detailed his ordeal with mucositis, which happened while he was on a pre-planned vacation from work, &lt;a href="https://wgntv.com/news/medical-watch/there-have-been-some-really-hard-stretches-mike-lowe-reflects-on-his-cancer-fight/"&gt;in a segment on WGN&lt;/a&gt;, describing how he couldn’t swallow or sleep for six days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in general, the side effects never got so bad that he needed to take a medical leave from work. Rather, he went to work most days, sometimes wearing a small zippered pouch across his chest that contained chemotherapy medication, which traveled via a tube from the bag to a port in his chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanted cancer to be something important that was going on in the background of my life but not completely dominating it,” Lowe said. “If I could have a real purpose and go to work and feel like I was able to do it and do it well still, then I was going to do it no matter what.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe believes that he may have been able to keep working through cancer treatments partly because he was relatively young and healthy going into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August he did live shots each night from the United Center. He worked election night in November and then allowed &lt;a href="https://wgntv.com/video/there-have-been-some-really-hard-stretches-mike-lowe-reflects-on-his-cancer-fights/10255870/"&gt;WGN’s cameras to follow him&lt;/a&gt; to Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital for chemotherapy the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to kind of demystify cancer treatment or show exactly what it looks like,” Lowe said. “If you can help anybody understand what they’re about to go through, I think that helps, and the position of a journalist is to do that, to explain things and make them more understandable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Daniel Dammrich, one of Lowe’s doctors and an oncologist at Northwestern’s Lake Forest hospital, said he’s already seen people benefiting from Lowe’s news segments, getting screened for cancer earlier than they might have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades ago, before Lowe and Dammrich were patient and doctor, they were teenage football teammates at Loyola Academy in Wilmette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s just always been a great guy,” Dammrich said. “Mike has been extraordinarily brave to share his story, and there’s no doubt in my mind that it’s going to benefit a huge amount of people who are going to go for early colorectal cancer screenings so they can catch it in a time where we can intervene in a meaningful way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;‘Keep up the fight!’&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his treatment, Lowe received support from many unexpected quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after hearing about Lowe’s diagnosis, Joe Johnson, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2021/06/24/meet-joe-johnson-the-chicago-cubs-fan-behind-obvious-shirts-a-t-shirt-company-built-on-one-liners-a-love-of-baseball-and-a-little-luck-it-worked-i-cant-believe-it/"&gt;Obvious Shirts&lt;/a&gt;, released a T-shirt that said “Lowe Strong” with a similar design to the Bears sweaters coach Mike Ditka used to wear. Lowe had done stories on Johnson and Obvious Shirts in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you know Mike, you know he’s a huge Bears fan, a diehard Bears fan, so I thought it was only right we show our support,” Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, Gov. JB Pritzker sent Lowe a handwritten note expressing support and encouraging him to, “Keep up the fight!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have really felt the outpouring of support from really the entire city,” Lowe said. “I think that’s kind of a hallmark of Chicago. … You see how much you’re loved and you see how much people care and want to help. That is almost as important as the medical part, in terms of making you well again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in January, after chemotherapy, Lowe underwent an MRI and had a sigmoidoscopy, a procedure that involves using a camera to look at the lower part of the colon. If the tumor was still there, the next step would be surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe got tentatively good news. The doctor couldn’t see the tumor anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

(Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe was optimistic about his prospects, but he would need a colonoscopy and biopsies months later to see if the cancer had really retreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That colonoscopy happened earlier this month. Biopsies were performed on polyps found during the procedure, and they came back clear of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of like singing Hallelujah from the church balcony,” Lowe said of learning the results. “It definitely felt amazing because up until that point I didn’t know …I feel like it’s the complete response I’d been hoping against hope for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Lowe is characteristically optimistic, he knows he won’t be leaving cancer totally behind him just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’ll continue to undergo regular tests to ensure the cancer hasn’t returned. He’s also still dealing with lingering side effects, such as the numbness in his hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe also has no plans to step back from the public stage when it comes to discussing his experience. He has a calendar full of events in coming months where he’ll give speeches and emcee events to raise awareness and money for various cancer-related efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel like I owe it to anyone who’s dealing with cancer, if I can be the voice, whether it’s for fundraising, awareness or even if it’s just to comfort them, to show them, ‘Hey you can get through this,’ because at the time you get the diagnosis, it doesn’t always seem like that. It seems like a pretty steep hill to climb,” Lowe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I can continue to be that example to anyone, I want to continue to do that because I know how lucky I am to be through it.”&lt;/p&gt;

She shared that maintaining optimal brain, heart and bone function as well as immune health and disease prevention are all linked to having a nutrient-rich diet in place. “What we eat today shapes how we function tomorrow,” Mahajan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In terms of how to eat in a way that supports your healthspan, there are no gimmicks or surprises; it’s the tried-and-true dietary advice that has long been backed by scientific research. “Focus on whole foods: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and lean protein. Prioritize colorful meals, healthy fats like olive oil and nuts and adequate hydration,” Mahajan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmc.org/about-us/directory/doctor/hollis-d-day-md-ms" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Hollis Day, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a76eee4b0d1cc4a5a9665" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.bmc.org/about-us/directory/doctor/hollis-d-day-md-ms" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Hollis Day, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;the c&lt;span&gt;hief of geriatrics at Boston Medical Center, shared that the more balanced a diet someone has, the less they will have to depend on supplements to meet their nutrient needs. “That includes getting calcium through calcium-rich foods rather than supplements. The body absorbs it better and it’s definitely tastier,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As you approach the years you will qualify for an AARP membership, it’s important to up your protein intake. “Muscle mass naturally declines with age, so regular protein intake is key,” Mahajan said. She added that increasing fruit and vegetable intake is also important as we age. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5293796/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="One meta-analysis of nine studies" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a76eee4b0d1cc4a5a9665" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5293796/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One meta-analysis of nine studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that older adults with high fruit and vegetable intake had a significantly lower risk of cognitive decline. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Good nutrition helps our brain and cognition, lowering the risk of memory problems. It helps with bone and muscle strength, which lowers the risk of falling, and it also lowers the risk of diabetes and hypertension,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://uvahealth.com/findadoctor/Laurie-Archbald-Pannone-1356544233" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Laurie Archbald-Pannone" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a76eee4b0d1cc4a5a9665" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uvahealth.com/findadoctor/Laurie-Archbald-Pannone-1356544233" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Laurie Archbald-Pannone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;a geriatrician and associate professor of medicine at UCLA. “It’s important to think about how we can have an impact. Healthy aging isn’t all about diet, but it is something we can [control]. Regular movement and maintaining healthy relationships are other important parts of healthy aging we can control,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what geriatricians avoid consuming to support healthy aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Certainly, one meal isn’t going to destine you to years of failing health. Especially considering Archbald-Pannone’s point about the importance of healthy relationships, it’s important to remember that meals are about more than just getting nutrients; they’re also about enjoyment and a way to spend time with loved ones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Maria Korneeva via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Maria Korneeva via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;If you're wondering whether diet soda is an option, think again.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, there is something all of the geriatricians we talked to said they avoid because of how detrimental it is to health: sugar-sweetened beverages.

For flavoring, consider adding fruit (like lemon or sliced strawberries) or herbs (like mint).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While one soda every once in a while isn’t going to make or break your golden years, if you drink soda every day, it’s a habit worth reconsidering. After all, it’s the foods and drinks we consume regularly that impact health the most. If soda is a habit you just can’t quit, Archbald-Pannone said it can be helpful to reduce your soda intake gradually instead of trying to give it up completely right off the bat. Slowly and over time, you’ll find you won’t miss it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:00:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPd1dWak80cWU1SGJpWllmTUJoQWFOZExIY09jYVdXYjREd0NwRVdMaU10RGFxaW5WLVZNUjFRQ2lLSHczMUhZZ2dqSUppaDRXUU82YWlTdHdCekd4WjNsTER1Z3NZRlB2cWExS1F1cEwwOXRIOVFaTm9xS3EwVTBiWXFwa1R1cGpWeFNMTkhLcmtjaWZMUHU1R9IBngFBVV95cUxNUEM5bElUM2E4VFkxWmYyUDVtLTJDS2RheF92XzNoV2EyVGxMU3VCRzVRZjBjMnpUbzRKMEcybmEyVVZzdE5mU0FVazZheFpZNlhlOVlqUnZmUWlxbjhKZFVwOGdYV1FtaDBmMlIxRmJoSHJxX2JGc0JuQUxIYVlrb0tBR0JXcTdibDA2eUdLcFdPTl9DYWFwaTVhV3dXQQ</guid></item><item><title>来自全国各地的人都想来CT进行健康手术。这是为了什么。- Hartford Courant | People from across the country want to come to CT for a health procedure.

A stroke in 2013 had immobilized much the left side of his body. He’d lost the job he loved running a marina and the housing that came with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nute’s life changed significantly over the last 12 months following the implant of a technology known as &lt;a href="https://www.vivistim.com/"&gt;Vivistim&lt;/a&gt; that’s gaining attention in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State lawmakers are looking to establish a program at the University of Connecticut, where 10 veterans will be able to undergo the procedure for free and physicians will conduct further research to improve the &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2024/11/26/a-stroke-changed-a-teachers-life-how-a-new-electrical-device-is-helping-her-move/"&gt;effectiveness of the treatment. &lt;/a&gt;The $55.7 billion two-year budget adopted by the legislature’s Appropriations Committee last Tuesday includes $2 million in fiscal year 2027 to establish a Center of Excellence for Neuromodulation Treatment at UConn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vivistim device, implanted in a patient’s neck and chest, includes a battery and a narrow cable that wraps around the vagus nerve. When turned on, the device sends electrical signals to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-iLgdKCFX" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_iLgdKCFX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation, as it’s known, refers to the process of altering how the brain receives information from the body by stimulating nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons physicians still don’t entirely understand, employing &lt;a href="https://www.neuromodulation.com/about-neuromodulation"&gt;neuromodulation&lt;/a&gt; by stimulating the vagus nerve through electric signals appears to rapidly increase the rate at which the brain learns new tasks. When paired with physical therapy, the device can help stroke survivors regain lost functionality — even if, like Nute, their stroke occurred several years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It supercharges therapy,” Christopher Conner, the &lt;a href="https://health.uconn.edu/"&gt;UConn&lt;/a&gt; neurosurgeon who performed the procedure on Nute. “You basically get into a state where your brain is able to learn or adapt more quickly,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conner was among a group of physicians on the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.housedems.ct.gov/genga/veterans-disabilities-task-force-meeting"&gt;Veterans with Disabilities Task Force&lt;/a&gt; who sought funding from the legislature to cover the procedure at UConn and subsequent rehabilitation at &lt;a href="https://hartfordhealthcare.org/"&gt;Hartford HealthCare&lt;/a&gt; for 10 veterans. The funding would offer much-needed health care to an underserved group, as well as provide physicians and researchers with more data about how exactly the procedure improves results for stroke patients, according to supporters.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;h4&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who suffer strokes often hit a recovery plateau beyond which it’s difficult for them to continue making progress towards regaining mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation offers results far beyond what’s been available in stroke recovery up to this point, according to several providers in the state. Connecticut physicians said they’ve seen patients regain basic functionality and return to hobbies — like cooking, playing guitar, and golfing — that they had to give up after their stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nute was still struggling with physical side effects when he saw an advertisement on Facebook promoting a new technology that could boost hand and arm function after a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just got tired of having my mobility impaired and wanted to improve it,” Nute said. Eager for results and open to new solutions, Nute reached out to the company and then an occupational therapist to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they met roughly a month later, in January 2024, Conner told Nute that he wanted to be transparent: He had never done the procedure before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘Well, I haven’t either, so that’s two of us,’” Nute recalled with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nute underwent the procedure in May of 2024, and since then he said his range of motion has increased significantly. He loves to cook, so he’s most excited about the accomplishments that translate to the kitchen. Nute still attends group rehabilitation regularly, both in-person and on Zoom, and he also receives Botox injections every three months that help to relax the muscles in his arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I first got the thing done, I wasn’t noticing improvements right away,” Nute said. But over time, he said, that changed. “When I look at videos of myself before and after, I can see significant differences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conner has now done a total of 12 implants, with another five booked in the next few months. He said he gets calls weekly from patients all over the country who want to come to Connecticut for the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The interest in this is unbelievable,” Conner said during public testimony at the state legislature. “Here at the &lt;a href="https://uconn.edu/"&gt;University of Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve established ourselves as a nation-leading center for this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagus nerve stimulation isn’t entirely new, Conner said. It’s been used in the past to treat seizures and depression, with limited results. But using the treatment for stroke recovery is novel — the Food and Drug Administration approved Vivistim to treat upper extremity impairments post-stroke in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real “magic,” as Conner puts it, happens in therapy, which patients begin two weeks after getting the implant. For six weeks, patients attend rehabilitation three times a week, for 90 minutes per session. The sessions focus on completing upper extremity exercises, like reach and grasp, object flipping and needle threading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each task is repeated about 50 times, and patients might perform a total of 300 repetitions in a single session, Subramani Seetharama, a rehabilitation specialist at Hartford HealthCare, said. As the patient performs these exercises, the physician turns on the Vivistim system, which sends those electric signals to the patient’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seetharama, who’s been practicing medicine for 30 years, said he’s been frustrated that treatments available to stroke patients up until now have only offered temporary improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been kind of disappointing,” Seetharama said. “But here I see an amazing, lasting, persistent improvement in strength and function.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Brown, cofounder of &lt;a href="https://www.strokeot.org/"&gt;StrokeOT Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and an occupational therapist who has treated Nute and other Vivistim patients, stated in written public hearing testimony that she has “witnessed truly miraculous results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vivistim has given chronic stroke survivors renewed hope and optimism for their continued recovery journey,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;State funding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicians still have lots of questions about how the mechanics of neuromodulation helps facilitate better results for stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed state funding would go towards studying brain activity in patients at different points in their treatment. It would also fund research on the effects of the treatment on patients’ ability to walk. Vivistim is currently only FDA-approved for upper extremity recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the dirty secrets of many things in modern medicine is we have a poor understanding of how it works,” Conner said. “The problem with that is that it makes it very difficult to make to optimize that therapy. So what we want to do is we want to figure out what parts of the brain are actually leading to this improved learning ability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Foust, CEO of Vivistim distributor &lt;a href="https://www.microtransponder.com/"&gt;MicroTransponder Inc.,&lt;/a&gt; said in emailed comments that “the company applauds UConn Health, Hartford HealthCare and all the champions of this bill for bringing it closer to fruition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“MicroTransponder is incredibly honored that this legislation will make Vivistim available to our Veterans to improve their hand and arm function post-stroke,” wrote Foust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the public hearing for the proposal, Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien, asked whether there are other potential funding sources for this treatment and research outside of the state government. Conner said that in the current environment, much of grant funding is on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Granting agencies and the program officers are telling people that nothing is getting reviewed,” Conner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nute said the idea of more people getting access to Vivistim is “wonderful” and that funding for research is “needed.” More than a decade after his stroke, he remains deeply involved in the survivor community. He serves on the board of a stroke survivors support group and regularly speaks about his experience with neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I talk to people virtually everyday who’ve either had a stroke or they know somebody that’s had a stroke and try to get them thinking that this is not the end of the road,” Nute said. “There is hope. Don’t give up.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As humans age, particularly after middle age, their brain functions, cognitive abilities and memory can deteriorate to varying degrees. Aging-related disorders marked by cognitive decline, particularly dementia, have become increasingly widespread over the past decades.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Estimates suggest that the number of individuals diagnosed with dementia could increase from 55 million in 2019 to around 139 million by 2050. Understanding the factors contributing to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and devising methods to detect the first signs of dementia is thus of the utmost importance, as it could help to reliably pick up its emergence and plan therapeutic interventions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, some studies have found a link between people's ability to perceive and identify odors (i.e., olfactory function) and their cognitive abilities as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;. While the relationship between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/olfactory+dysfunction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;olfactory dysfunction&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive decline is now well-documented, whether one causes the other or they are the result of similar aging-related or neurodegenerative mechanisms remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Fudan University in China recently carried out a study to further explore the link between olfactory dysfunction and cognitive decline in older adults. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03346-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that the nasal &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/microbiome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., the set of microorganisms residing in each individual's nasal passages) could contribute to the relationship between olfactory function and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Emerging evidence has highlighted that olfactory dysfunction, a common feature of aging, is increasingly linked to cognitive decline in older adults," wrote Huiling Song, Jiaojiao Zou and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, research on the underlying mechanism, particularly the role of nasal microbiome, remains limited. In this study, we investigated the associations between olfactory function, the nasal microbiome, and cognition among 510 older adults with an average age of 77.9 years."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of their study, the researchers recruited 510 older adults and looked at their olfactory function, nasal microbiomes and cognitive abilities. Their olfactory function was assessed using a procedure known as the brief Chinese smell identification test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+abilities/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive abilities&lt;/a&gt; of the study participants, the researchers asked them to complete tests based on two psychometric measures, known as the mini-mental state examination and a revised Hasegawa dementia scale. Finally, they generated microbiome profiles for each participant using a method known as 16S RNA gene sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We observed that olfactory dysfunction (i.e., hyposmia) was associated with a higher richness of nasal bacteria, and such observation was replicated in an external dataset," wrote Song, Zou and their colleagues. "A total of 18 nasal bacterial genera were identified to be associated with olfactory function, with eight genera such as Acidovorax and Morganella being enriched in the hyposmic group."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;When they analyzed the data they collected, the researchers unveiled correlations between some microbial profiles and different levels of cognitive impairments. In fact, they found that people with microbiome profiles marked by a prevalence of some genus of bacteria were found to have milder cognitive impairments than those that predominantly contained other genus of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A composite microbial index of nasal olfactory function significantly improved the reclassification accuracy of the traditional risk model in distinguishing hyposmic from normosmic participants (P = 0.008)," wrote Song, Zou and their colleagues. "Furthermore, participants with a nasal biotype dominated by Corynebacterium had a lower prevalence of mild cognitive impairment compared to those dominated by Dolosigranulum or Moraxella."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that the types of bacteria populating the noses of individuals could contribute to the previously reported link between older people's &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/olfactory+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;olfactory function&lt;/a&gt; and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, their study could pave the way for further research focusing on the nasal microbiome profiles they identified, which may help to devise new strategies to detect cognitive decline early and plan targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/signs-symptoms-screenings-treatments-bowel-cancer/"&gt;Bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt; is on the rise in young people – even in those with no family history of the disease or obvious risk factors, like being overweight, smoking or drinking too much alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases among the under-50s have shot up by 22 per cent over the last few decades too. Now every year, more than 2,600 people in this age group are told they have &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/signs-symptoms-screenings-treatments-bowel-cancer/"&gt;bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason behind the surge remains unknown. Our sedentary lifestyles, the rise in obesity, heavy drinking and low-fibre, high-fat diets are some of the reasons that scientists have put forward as contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that exposure to a toxin in childhood – called colibactin and produced by certain strains of E. coli – could, at least in part, be fuelling the surge. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What are the strains of E. coli that are causing concern?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/e-coli-outbreak-uk-symptoms-how-does-it-spread/"&gt;Escherichia coli (E. coli)&lt;/a&gt; bacteria is commonly found in our guts. Most strains are harmless and some, such as Nissle 1917 (EcN) are even beneficial and aid in digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, others, such as pks+ E. coli, release toxins that may cause bowel cancer. Scientists don’t yet know how these “bad bug” make there way into our gut or how we can avoid them. Additionally, they may not be harmful in all cases and some strains that produce toxins are even used in probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of a research study, it’s not currently possible to tell whether the bacteria in your gut are producing harmful toxins that could raise your bowel cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What is colibactin, the worrying toxin?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain strains of E. coli produce a bacterial toxin called colibactin. This is thought to be a defence mechanism to protect itself from other bacteria, explains Dr Paul Brennan, who runs the genetics section at the International Agency for Research on Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colibactin can damage the DNA in our bowel cells by introducing mutations, adds Justin Stebbing, an oncologist and professor of biomedical sciences at Anglia Ruskin University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How could colibactin be fuelling the rise in bowel cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNA damage caused by colibactin leaves a trail of mutations that scientists have previously found in 10 to 15 per cent of all bowel &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/least-survivable-cancers/"&gt;cancer cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the new study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, strengthens this link, suggesting that exposure to colibactin in early childhood by the age of 10 sets the stage for cancer, long before symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists led by the University of California San Diego analysed nearly 1,000 bowel cancer genomes and found that mutations caused by colibactin were 3.3 times more common in patients who developed bowel cancer before they turned 40, compared to those who developed the disease after the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests a strong link between colibactin exposure and early onset bowel cancer,” says Dr Vivian Li, the group leader of the Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The latest research on this shows a clear correlation, especially in younger people, between colibactin and the production of mutations that potentially caused bowel cancers to grow,” adds Prof Trevor Graham, the director of the Centre for Evolution and Cancer at The Institute of Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is more work to do to really prove that colibactin is responsible for the increase that we’re seeing in early onset bowel cancer, but we should be looking very hard at the link with colibactin producing bugs going forward,” Prof Graham adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it may be that colibactin is just one part of the jigsaw puzzle of risks fuelling the rise in bowel cancer among young people, Prof Stebbing notes. “I’d describe it as a potential culprit. We just can’t say it’s causative,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How can I avoid being exposed to colibactin?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists don’t yet know how children are being exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria, so it isn’t yet clear what actions will reduce the risk of it &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/the-little-known-cancer-thats-linked-to-the-gut/"&gt;taking hold in your gut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are working to try to understand exactly when these mutations occur,” says Dr Brennan, who is also co-investigator for Cancer Research UK’s Cancer Grand Challenges, which funded the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they occur within the first weeks of life then this would implicate exposures around childbirth and weaning. This is when the infant microbiome is formed. Conversely, if they occur later in infancy, this could implicate dietary sources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just don’t know yet what might disrupt the natural bacteria in the gut early in life to lead to growth of these strains of bacteria that produce colibactin,” Prof Stebbing adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Dr Li notes that contaminated food and untreated water can contain these bacteria, so improving food safety and hygiene may help minimise exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And some colibactin-producing bacteria are used in probiotics, she notes. “More research would be needed to address the safety [of this],” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the latest study are now investigating potential sources – such as diet, the environment and lifestyle behaviours – and what can be done to prevent or mitigate that contact with these bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also not currently possible to find out whether you have worrying mutations caused by the bacterial toxin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is very much laboratory based research just now, and there’s no routine test for it,” Prof Stebbing explains. However, the researchers are currently developing an early detection test to analyse stool samples for colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, even if these tests become available, it is unclear what can be done to reduce the risk of bowel cancer occurring. “We don’t have a treatment available, or know if removal of the bugs would be beneficial to prevent bowel cancer, or even if there could be other unintended consequences,” notes Prof Graham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What can I do to protect against bowel cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are exploring whether &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/probiotics-gut-health/"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; could safely eliminate harmful bacterial strains from the gut, which produce colibactin. In the meantime, there are plenty of other actions that can dramatically lower your bowel cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding more fibre to your diet – such as by eating plenty of fruit, vegetables, legumes and wholegrains – can drive down the chance of developing the disease because it helps to keep bowel movements regular, meaning harmful chemicals in stools spend less time in the bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, fibre interacts with bacteria in the gut to make butyrate, which helps keep the cells in the bowel healthy, reducing the risk of tumours developing. More than a quarter (28 per cent) of bowel cancer cases are caused by not consuming enough fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting red and processed meat intake can help to reduce your risk of bowel cancer. Around 13 per cent of bowel cancer cases in the UK are linked to having too much of it in our diet because the foods contain substances such as nitrates and nitrites, which damage the cells in the bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is another cause of bowel cancer (estimated to be behind 11 per cent of cases) so losing weight by eating a balanced diet and exercising more can help to reduce your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being physically active and cutting back on alcohol are also changes you can make to reduce bowel cancer risk,” says Sophia Lowes, a senior health information manager at Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No matter how old you are, if you notice anything that isn’t normal for you, don’t ignore it, speak to your doctor. In most cases it won’t be cancer, but if it is, spotting it early can make a real difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of bowel cancer include &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/what-the-colour-and-consistency-of-your-poo-says-health/"&gt;changes in stools&lt;/a&gt; – such as having softer stools, diarrhoea or constipation that is not normal for you – needing to go to the toilet more often and blood in the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whatever your age, it’s important that you contact your GP and ask for an at-home test if you spot any symptoms,” says Dr Lisa Wilde, director of research, policy and influencing at Bowel Cancer UK. “Bowel cancer is treatable and curable especially if diagnosed early.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Phase 3 study of the M72/AS01E vaccine, which is taking place at 54 sites across five countries, started delivering shots to volunteers last March. While its sponsors had originally said it may take up to two years to complete enrollment, they announced Monday that the sites in South Africa, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, and Indonesia have successfully recruited the 20,000 participants needed for the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People have generally been really enthusiastic about participating,” said Lee Fairlie, a researcher at Johannesburg’s University of the Witwatersrand and one of the principal investigators for the South Africa trial sites. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two-dose M72 vaccine has generated high hopes among experts that they could in the coming years have a new tool to reduce deaths from and cut transmission of one of the world’s leading killers. But its clinical trial is advancing at a time when the TB field is grappling with dramatic U.S. global health funding cuts, which are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/health/tuberculosis-kenya-us-cuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;already threatening treatment and surveillance programs&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. has also moved &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;to pull support for Gavi&lt;/a&gt;, which helps low-income countries — including those with the highest TB burdens — purchase vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know yet what the full impacts are of the cuts, but almost certainly it will have a huge impact on TB screening, diagnosis, and probably treatment,” Fairlie said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vaccine trial is being funded by the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, and has not been affected by the U.S. withdrawal from the global health stage. The Gates Medical Research Institute, which is a subsidiary of the foundation, is leading the development of the vaccine, which includes an adjuvant — an ingredient that can supercharge the immune response a vaccine elicits — provided by GSK.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis, which is a bacterial infection, still kills more than a million people a year. It’s estimated that perhaps a quarter of the global population has a latent case, meaning cases in which individuals are not sick despite harboring the bacteria, but some percentage of them will eventually get seriously ill from their infections. When people develop this full-blown, pulmonary form of TB, it’s also when they’re likely to spread the bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is designed to prevent adolescents and adults from advancing to the dangerous stage of an infection. An existing TB vaccine, which is known as BCG and dates back to 1921, can protect babies and young children against severe TB, but isn’t particularly effective in older people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those involved in the trial said it completed enrollment so quickly because it was designed to focus on sites in areas that previous epidemiological studies had identified as TB hotspots. TB is so pervasive in these communities that many people were eager to volunteer for a study, having a personal understanding of the potential impact of being able to prevent cases. Sponsors also credited the trial sites for working in their communities over time to build trust with people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Community engagement was something that was built in at a very early stage at all the clinical trial sites,” said Alex Pym, the director of infectious disease at Wellcome, who earlier in his career worked on TB control in South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially, the trial was set to&lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2023/06/funding-commitment-m72-tb-vaccine-candidate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; enroll 26,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers refined the protocol over time, and found that they could get an answer about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine with 20,000 volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study is powered to measure a vaccine efficacy of about 50%, which the shot reached in an earlier Phase 2 study. Though researchers hope for even better results, they emphasize that having a tool that is 50% effective at reducing pulmonary TB could still have dramatic effects, given that there are millions of cases each year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trial is expected to take three to five years, though it will depend on how quickly cases of pulmonary TB develop among participants, some of whom will receive the vaccine and some of whom will receive placebo doses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even so, the vaccine’s backers are already starting to make plans to move toward potential regulatory approval, manufacturing efforts, and an eventual rollout — including decisions on which groups to target and where to launch it first.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;What percentage of the authors in elite philosophy journals are women?&lt;span id="more-53654"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the question &lt;a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eric Schwitzgebel&lt;/a&gt; (UC Riverside) takes up in the following guest post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Author Gender in Elite Philosophy Journals&lt;br&gt;
by Eric Schwitzgebel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the gender situation has been improving in philosophy. Women &lt;a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2023/09/percentage-of-women-philosophy-majors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;now constitute about 40%&lt;/a&gt; of graduating majors in philosophy in the U.S., up from about 32% in the 1980s-2010s. There is, I think, substantially more awareness of gender issues and the desirability of gender diversity than there was fifteen years ago. And yet, &lt;a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DiversityUS.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;at the highest levels of impact and prestige&lt;/a&gt;, philosophy remains &lt;a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-gender-and-raceethnicity-of-authors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;overwhelmingly male&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One measure of this is authorship in elite philosophy journals. For this post, I examined the past two years’ tables of contents of &lt;i&gt;Philosophical Review, Mind, Journal of Philosophy,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Noûs&lt;/i&gt;—widely considered to be the most elite general philosophy journals in mainstream Anglophone philosophy. (&lt;a href="https://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2022/07/best-general-philosophy-journals-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Some rankings&lt;/a&gt; put &lt;i&gt;Philosophy &amp;amp; Phenomenological Research&lt;/i&gt; alongside these four.) I estimated the gender of each author of each article, commentary, or response (excluding book reviews and editorial prefaces), based on gender-typical name, gender-typical photo, pronoun use, and/or personal knowledge, generally using at least two criteria. Of 291 included authors, there were only two who were either non-binary or defied classification—in both cases, based on an expressed preference for they/them pronouns. There’s always a risk of mistake, but for the most part I expect that my gender classifications accurately reflect how the authors identify and are perceived, with at most a 1-2% error rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authorship Rates In Four Elite Philosophy Journals (Past Two Years):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Women: 46 authorships&lt;br&gt;
Men: 243 authorships&lt;br&gt;
Nonbinary/unclassified: 2 authorships&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Percent women: 16%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women now earn &lt;a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2023/11/percent-of-us-philosophy-phd-recipients.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;about 30% of PhDs&lt;/a&gt; in the United States and constitute &lt;a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/data_on_profession/fy2024_demographic_statistic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;almost 30% of American Philosophical Association members&lt;/a&gt; who report their gender, so authorship in these journals is substantially more gender-skewed than faculty in the US. Of course, many authors are neither located nor received their PhD in the US, so these percentages aren’t strictly comparable. However, PhD and faculty percentages are &lt;a href="https://bpa.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-BPA-SWIP-Report-Women-in-Philosophy-in-the-UK.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;broadly similar in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and, impressionistically, in other high-income Anglophone countries. (I’m less sure outside the English-speaking world, but researchers in non-Anglophone countries author only a small percentage of articles in elite Anglophone journals; see here for an analysis of the &lt;a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Anglophone.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;insularity of Anglophone philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, one possible explanation of this skew is that women are more likely to specialize in ethics than in other areas of philosophy (see these &lt;a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/11/percentage-of-women-at-apa-meetings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ten-year-old data&lt;/a&gt;), and these four journals publish relatively little ethics. To explore this possibility, I did two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I coded each article in the big four journals as either “ethics” or “non-ethics”, based on the title or the abstract (if the title was ambiguous). I included political philosophy, social philosophy, metaethics, and history of ethics as ethics. (Of course, there were some gray-area cases and judgment calls.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I added two journals to my list: &lt;i&gt;Ethics&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Philosophy &amp;amp; Public Affairs&lt;/i&gt;, generally considered the two most elite ethics journals (though after the &lt;a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/05/22/editors-at-philosophy-will-launch-new-oa-journal/"&gt;editorial turmoil&lt;/a&gt; at PPA last year, it’s not clear whether this will remain true of PPA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the big four, I classified 60/291 (21%) authorships as ethics. (Perhaps this is a slight underrepresentation of ethics in these journals, relative to the proportion of research faculty in the Anglophone world who specialize in ethics?) In these journals, I found that indeed women have a higher percentage of ethics authorships than non-ethics authorships:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authorship by Gender in Big 4 Philosophy Journals Ethics vs. Non-Ethics&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Ethics: 17/60 (28% women)&lt;br&gt;
Non-ethics: 29/231 (13% women)&lt;br&gt;
[Fisher’s exact 2-tail, p = .005]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we juice up the sample size by adding in &lt;i&gt;Ethics&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPA&lt;/i&gt;, we get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authorship by Gender in 6 Elite Philosophy Journals Ethics vs. Non-Ethics&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Ethics: 40/142 (29% women)&lt;br&gt;
Non-ethics: 29/231 (13% women)&lt;br&gt;
[Fisher’s exact 2-tail, p &amp;lt; .001]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, women appear to be more than twice as likely to author ethics articles than non-ethics articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/12/only-13-of-authors-in-five-leading.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ten years ago, I did some similar analyses,&lt;/a&gt; comparing ethics vs. non-ethics authorships in two-year bins every 20 years from 1955 to 2015. In those samples, too, I found women to author only a small percentage of articles in elite journals overall (13% in 2014-2015) and to be more likely to author in ethics, so the trends are historically consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="separator"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/section&gt;

Unlike other digestive diseases, IBS doesn't cause physical damage to the digestive tract, but significantly impacts quality of life due to its disruption of the brain-gut connection.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;April is marked as IBS Awareness Month, aiming to spread more knowledge about this condition. Awareness is key, as many people suffer without realising they have IBS or what they can do to manage it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/09/02/Pictures/anxiety-shutterstock_a33af226-70d3-11e6-93fb-3c3e574fb2a6.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Stress and diet are well-known factors for triggering IBS. (Shutterstock)" title="Stress and diet are well-known factors for triggering IBS. (Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Stress and diet are well-known factors for triggering IBS. (Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pariksha Rao said, “Despite its prevalence in India many suffer without proper diagnosis or management strategies. Modern lifestyles, increasing stress levels and changing dietary patterns have contributed to rising cases across the country. There’s also increasing evidence that IBS is closely linked to the gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis — the two-way communication system between our brain and digestive system. When this system is out of balance, it can make the gut overly sensitive or change how the muscles in the intestines move, causing IBS symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How diet affects IBS symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet plays a crucial role in managing IBS. Pariksha Rao revealed, “Indian food is often rich in spices, fiber, and fermented ingredients, which can either help or harm those with IBS, depending on how the body reacts. Traditional diets may offer some relief, but modern diets — which are increasingly full of processed foods, sugar, and fats — can make symptoms worse.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She explained, “One of the major triggers for IBS is food that is high in FODMAPs [Fermentable Oligosaccharides (e.g. fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides) Disaccharides (e.g. lactose) Monosaccharides (e.g. excess fructose) and Polyols (e.g. sorbitol and mannitol)] — short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine. Common FODMAP foods in the Indian diet include garlic, onions and fruits like apples. These foods ferment in the gut, creating gas and causing bloating, pain and irregular bowel movements.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2021/11/26/550x309/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1070984_1637902115863_1637902151004.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Avoid gassy founds: You need to avoid foods such as beans, cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce during the initial days of your periods to make sure the bloating doesn't get enhanced.(Pexels)" title="Avoid gassy founds: You need to avoid foods such as beans, cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce during the initial days of your periods to make sure the bloating doesn't get enhanced.(Pexels)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Avoid gassy founds: You need to avoid foods such as beans, cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce during the initial days of your periods to make sure the bloating doesn't get enhanced.(Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expert added, “Caffeine and carbonated drinks are also triggers for many IBS patients. They can stimulate the gut too much and lead to diarrhea or gas. Artificial sweeteners like sorbitol, xylitol, and mannitol — often found in sugar-free products — are also known to cause bloating and discomfort because they are not fully absorbed in the gut.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing IBS through balanced diets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pariksha Rao suggested, “A balanced diet, rich in the right kind of fiber and low in irritants, can make a big difference. Probiotics — found in yogurt, kefir, or supplements — can help restore a healthy gut microbiome and reduce symptoms. However, fiber intake should be monitored. For people with IBS-D (diarrhea-dominant IBS), too much fiber can worsen symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to her, what works best is a personalised approach. Pariksha Rao said, “Some people may benefit from reducing dairy or gluten, while others might need to stay away from specific vegetables or fruits. Eating smaller meals, staying hydrated, and avoiding foods that are hard to digest or cause gas are all recommended steps. Keeping a food diary can also help identify which foods trigger symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/07/01/550x309/jusfilm-43seK8CwOGM-unsplash_1656685190192_1656685334925.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Ginger: Ginger helps speed up the process of the movement of food through the GI tract while protecting the gut.

It may ease intestinal cramping, bloating and gas.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking about a holistic approach to gut health, Pariksha Rao asserted, “IBS is a complex condition with no one-size-fits-all solution but by understanding how diet and stress influence gut health, individuals can take control of their symptoms. In India, as awareness grows and more people seek professional advice, better management is becoming possible. With the right combination of diet, probiotics, and stress-relief practices, people living with IBS can enjoy a better quality of life.

The first is that a person's earwax can actually convey a surprising amount of information about them – both trivial and important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For example, the vast majority of people of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10886-014-0533-y" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;European or African descent&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;i id="wet" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;wet&lt;/i&gt; earwax, which is yellow or orange in colour and sticky. However, 95% of East Asian people have &lt;i id="dry" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;dry &lt;/i&gt;earwax, which is grey and non-sticky. The gene responsible for producing either wet or dry earwax is called &lt;i id="abcc11," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;ABCC11, &lt;/i&gt;which also happens to be responsible for whether a person has smelly armpits. Around 2% of people – mostly those in the dry earwax category – have a version of this gene which means their armpits &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/dependence-of-deodorant-usage-on-abcc11-genotype-scope-for-person" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;have no odour&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, perhaps the most useful earwax-related discoveries relate to what the sticky stuff in our ears can reveal about our health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;&lt;span id="important-clues" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="important-clues" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Important clues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 1971, Nicholas L Petrakis, a professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco, found that Caucasian, African-American and German women in the USA, who all had "wet earwax", had an approximately four-fold higher chance of dying from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.173.3994.347" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; than Japanese and Taiwanese women with "dry" earwax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;More recently in 2010, researchers from the Tokyo Institute of Technology took blood samples from 270 female patients with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/30/12/5189" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;invasive breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and 273 female volunteers who acted as controls.

"It kind of builds up, and so there's certainly a reason to think that it might be a good place to capture long-term snapshots of changes in metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;&lt;span id="tricky-diagnoses" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="tricky-diagnoses" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Tricky diagnoses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;With this in mind, Antoniosi Filho and his team are developing the "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48121-4" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cerumenogram&lt;/a&gt;" – a diagnostic tool they claim can accurately predict whether a person has certain forms of cancer based on their earwax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a 2019 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48121-4" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;study,&lt;/a&gt; Antoniosi Filho's team collected earwax samples from 52 cancer patients who had been diagnosed with either lymphoma, carcinoma, or leukaemia. The researchers also took earwax from 50 healthy subjects. They then analysed the samples using a method which can accurately detect the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) – chemicals that evaporate easily in air.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers identified 27 compounds in earwax that served as a kind of "fingerprint" for cancer diagnosis. In other words, the team could predict with 100% accuracy whether someone had cancer (either lymphoma, carcinoma, or leukaemia) based on the concentrations of these 27 molecules. Interestingly, the test could not distinguish between different types of cancer, suggesting that the molecules are produced either by, or as a response to, cancer cells from all these types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Although cancer consists of hundreds of diseases, from a metabolic point of view, cancer is a single biochemical process, which can be detected at any stage through the evaluation of specific VOCs," says Antoniosi Filho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While in 2019 the team identified 27 VOCs, they are currently focusing on a small number of these that are exclusively produced by cancer cells as part of their unique metabolism. In as-yet unpublished work, Antoniosi Filho says they have also shown that the cerumenogram is able to detect the metabolic disturbances that occur in pre-cancerous stages, where cells exhibit abnormal changes that could potentially lead to cancer, but are not yet cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Considering that medicine indicates that most cancers diagnosed at stage 1 have up to a 90% cure rate, it is conceivable that the success in treatment will be much higher with the diagnosis of pre-cancer stages," says Antoniosi Filho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC Earwax helps to trap invaders such as bacteria and fungi before they can enter our heads (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Earwax helps to trap invaders such as bacteria and fungi before they can enter our heads (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The research group is also studying whether the metabolic changes caused by the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's could also be picked up by such a device, although this work is in the early stages.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"In the future, we hope that the cerumenogram will become a routine clinical examination, preferably every six months, that allows, with a small portion of earwax, to simultaneously diagnose diseases such as diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, as well as evaluate metabolic changes resulting from other health conditions," says Antoniosi Filho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Brazil, the Amaral Carvalho Hospital has recently adopted the cerumenogram as a diagnostic and monitoring technique for cancer treatment, says Antoniosi Filho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Musah is also hopeful that her research will one day help people suffering from Ménière's disease, a condition for which there is currently no cure.

The most prevalent type is Type 2 diabetes, which emerges when blood sugar becomes difficult to control, often due to weight issues, lack of &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/exercise" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; or genetic predisposition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; has clarified that Type 2 diabetes arises when insulin production falters, a reality for about one in ten people over 40 in Britain. Foods high in sugar can trigger increases in blood sugar levels, and everyday items can have hidden sugars that exacerbate this issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Prolonged high blood sugar can cause serious &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; complications, including organ damage and heightened chances of strokes and heart disease. Recognising which food items spike your blood sugar is thus essential in managing diabetes, as highlighted by the &lt;a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/seven-foods-diabetics-should-avoid-30630012" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"&gt;Daily Record.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/food-and-drink" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; deemed &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/healthy-eating" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;healthy&lt;/a&gt; might adversely affect blood sugar.

They wrote: "While there are properties of grape seeds that help to lower blood glucose levels, a single grape contains approximately one gram of carbohydrate. Because of this, diabetic people should moderate their grape consumption, particularly if they are prone to high blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If you consider a serving of dried fruit is only a tablespoon and packs in 20g carbs total sugar, you can see how easily this happens."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diabetes.co.uk also points out that it's not usually necessary to cut down on fruit consumption, but maintaining a food diary could be beneficial in monitoring your intake. The British Dietetic Association (BDA) highlights the importance of steering clear of high Glycaemic Index (GI) foods, stating: "Each time you have a sugary or starchy food or drink, the blood glucose level in your body rises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Some of these foods are quickly digested and cause quick and sharp rises in your blood glucose levels – they are called high GI foods and drinks."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conversely, low GI foods take longer to digest and result in a more gradual increase in blood glucose. These are often referred to as 'slow-release' carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31520419" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;An accurate diagnosis of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="159326" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; is crucial in bringing clarity and the right support to people who need it, but current diagnosis methods are time-consuming and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2019.1696409"&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt;. A new study suggests AI could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in South Korea trained&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"&gt; machine learning&lt;/a&gt; models to connect characteristics in photos of the fundus at the back of the eye to a professional diagnosis of ADHD (&lt;span&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of four  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="159326" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; models tested in the study, the best achieved a 96.9 percent score for predicting ADHD accurately, based on image analysis alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that higher blood vessel density, shape and width of vessels, and certain changes in the eye's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_disc"&gt;optic disc&lt;/a&gt; were key signs someone had the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159329" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159329" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/RetinaScans.jpg" alt="Retina scans" class="wp-image-159329 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/RetinaScans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/RetinaScans-600x356.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159329" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers were able to link characteristics in retinal fundus photographs to ADHD. (Choi et al, &lt;em&gt;npj Digital Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several years it's been thought that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-of-6000-scans-reveals-brain-wide-patterns-linked-to-adhd-symptoms"&gt;brain connectivity changes associated with ADHD&lt;/a&gt; could also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/retina-recordings-could-be-used-to-identify-adhd-and-asd"&gt;show up in our eyes&lt;/a&gt;. If we can figure out what to look for, this could mean a faster, more reliable method for spotting the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our analysis of retinal fundus photographs demonstrated potential as a noninvasive biomarker for ADHD screening and executive function deficit stratification in the visual attention domain," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01547-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers, led by a team from Yonsei University College of Medicine, in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach was tested on 323 children and adolescents already diagnosed with ADHD, and another 323 without an ADHD diagnosis, matched by age and sex to the first group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found the AI system scored highly across several measures when it came to predicting ADHD. It also performed well at spotting some of the characteristics of the disorder, including impairments in &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09297049.2022.2057940"&gt;visual selective attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/abnormal-patterns-in-brain-waves-may-indicate-adhd-expert-says"&gt;machine learning techniques&lt;/a&gt; to screen for ADHD have been explored recently, from analysis of alternative &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24552-4"&gt;eye scans&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560021/full"&gt;behavioral tests&lt;/a&gt;, but this one has a few major drawcards. While not the absolute most accurate method in terms of raw scores, it's very close, it's also quick to run and assess, and simple to scale up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Notably, earlier high-accuracy models typically relied on a diverse set of variables, each contributing incrementally to differentiating subjects," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01547-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our approach simplifies the analysis by focusing exclusively on retinal photographs. This single-source data strategy enhances the clarity and utility of our models."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers want to try these tests across larger groups of people and wider age ranges. The average age of participants in this study was 9.5 years, and we know ADHD in adults &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-figuring-out-if-its-anxiety-adhd-or-both-matters"&gt;can present quite differently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also room for improving the scope of the system: for example, those with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; were excluded from the main part of this study, but further tests showed the AI wasn't great at distinguishing  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="159326" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; from ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-023-02228-3"&gt;Recent estimates&lt;/a&gt; suggest about 1 in 20 people have ADHD, which can involve struggles with attention, impulses, and hyperactivity. That's a lot of individuals for whom a quicker, more accurate diagnosis could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Early screening and timely intervention can improve social, familial, and academic functioning in individuals with ADHD," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01547-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01547-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;npj Digital Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;ST. PAUL, Minn., April 28 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; A study released Monday links a total of more than 124,000 preventable, premature deaths in the United States over two years to adverse health affects from consuming ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study's Brazilian authors also analyzed data on ultra-processed food consumption from seven other countries, concluding that premature deaths tied to unhealthy diets are a growing global phenomenon calling for coordinated international action.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the nearly 125,000 premature U.S. deaths for 2017 and 2018, the study, &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2025.02.018" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine, also estimated that more than 25,000 Brazilians died prematurely during those years because of poor health outcomes tied to ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers' statistical model also showed more than 17,000 such deaths in Britain during 2018 and 2019 and another 17,000 in Mexico during a single year, 2016.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Canada had more than 7,700 premature deaths attributed to ultra-processed foods in 2016, the authors estimated, while Australia recorded 3,277 in 2016, Colombia had 2,813 in 2015 and Chile tallied 1,874 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods, or UPFs, generally are defined as those that include mass-produced ingredients that can't be made at home, such as preservatives, emulsifiers and sweeteners. They often contain added fats, starches, sugars, salts and hydrogenated oils extracted from other foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks, sweets and chocolates, pizzas, hamburgers, chicken nuggets and other highly popular food items are defined as UPFs under the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11575809/" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA food classification system&lt;/a&gt;. High consumption of these foods has &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2024/12/10/ultra-processed-foods-colon-cancer-risk/3971733847214/" target="_blank"&gt;been associated&lt;/a&gt; with many different diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, some types of cancer and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2018, UPFs already made up more than half of the total dietary energy consumed in high-income countries such as the United States, Canada and Britain, and between one-fifth and one-third of total dietary energy in middle-income countries such as Brazil, Mexico and Chile, according to a University of São Paulo &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/ultraprocessed-foods-what-they-are-and-how-to-identify-them/E6D744D714B1FF09D5BCA3E74D53A185" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic is receiving renewed attention due to the agenda of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2025/04/04/Kennedy-HHS-MAHA-tour/5261743790167/" target="_blank"&gt;focusing&lt;/a&gt; on the perceived dangers of UPFs during his "Make American Healthy Again" tour this month.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate their numbers, the study's authors developed a comparative risk assessment looking at dietary share of UPFs and all-cause mortality in each country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then employed a statistical model to estimate the percentage of all premature preventable deaths due to the consumption of UPFs, tapping studies from many countries and the landmark &lt;a href="https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/gbd" target="_blank"&gt;Global Burden of Disease&lt;/a&gt; report of 2021, according to lead author Eduardo A.F. Nilson, a nutrition researcher at the University of São Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They determined the percentage of UPF-attributable premature deaths vary from 4% in countries with lower UPF consumption to almost 14% in countries with the highest UPF consumption such as the United States and Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nilson told UPI that while it wasn't much of a surprise the United States has the highest percentage of UPF-associated premature deaths, he noted the trajectory of U.S. deaths has stabilized in recent years while they continue to rise in low- and middle-income nations such as Brazil, Chile and Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings on the attributable deaths to UPF in low- and middle-income countries shows that UPFs are replacing traditional fresh and minimally processed foods ,and that this may increase deaths from non-communicable diseases associated with unhealthy dietary patterns," Nilson said in emailed comments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These countries are already facing accelerated nutritional and epidemiological transitions and the replacement of traditional diets by UPFs is increasing especially among low income families, reinforcing the challenges of the double burden of malnutrition."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global food systems have made UPFs more available and affordable in all countries, triggering changes in diets all over the world as well as new heath problems that "demand policy responses by national governments" the Brazilian researcher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPF consumption "represents a global priority, and it requires more than consumer education because food choices are determined by many factors beyond consumers, mostly related to the food environment," Nilson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Food choices are influenced by price, availability, information and other factors and education by itself is insufficient to ensure healthy diets. Therefore, we need to make healthy dietary behaviors easier and more accessible and affordable."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: "This means implementing fiscal and regulatory policies, including subsidies to fresh and minimally processed foods, taxation of UPFs -- as is already done for sugar-sweetened beverages in some countries -- improving front-of-pack food labelling, regulating food marketing and regulating food sales in settings such as schools, workplaces and hospitals, for example."&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists are now urging doctors to rethink the common step-by-step approach to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/pecans-found-to-improve-cholesterol-diet-quality-and-lower-heart-disease-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol treatment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol treatment&lt;/a&gt; and instead start a combination of two medications as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Problem With Waiting Too Long&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone has a heart attack, doctors usually start treatment with high-intensity statins right away. These drugs lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, which can stabilize blood vessels and help prevent another heart attack. Clinical trials have shown that using high-intensity statins early after a heart attack leads to fewer cardiovascular problems over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current guidelines recommend starting with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/wonder-drug-statins-may-provide-protection-against-depression/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt; and adding other drugs only if cholesterol levels stay too high. However, this slow, step-by-step strategy often delays getting cholesterol under control. Studies show fewer than 20% of heart attack patients reach their LDL cholesterol goals with statins alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Margrét Leósdóttir, Associate Professor at Lund University and senior cardiology consultant at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, Sweden. (CREDITL Åsa Hansdotter)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major problem is that two-thirds of heart attack patients are "statin-naive," meaning they were not on statins when the heart attack happened. For many people, the first time they get any cholesterol-lowering treatment is after their heart event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though high-intensity statins help, the majority still do not reach the recommended target of less than 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). This leaves patients vulnerable, especially in the first year after a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/blood-platelet-test-could-save-millions-of-americans-from-heart-attacks-and-strokes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; when the risk of another event is highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New Evidence Supports Early Combination Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research led by Margrét Leósdóttir from &lt;a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lund University;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lund University&lt;/a&gt; and Kausik Ray from &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Imperial College London;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Imperial College London&lt;/a&gt; provides strong evidence that an early combination of statins and ezetimibe can change outcomes for the better. Their study used data from 36,000 Swedish heart attack patients collected between 2015 and 2022 through the SWEDEHEART registry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying on a traditional randomized trial, which would be ethically challenging in this case, the researchers used advanced statistical modeling called a "trial emulation clone-censor-weight framework." This method allowed them to closely mimic a real-world clinical trial without putting patients at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared three groups: patients who received ezetimibe within 12 weeks of their heart attack, those who received it later (between 13 weeks and 16 months), and those who never received it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: early combination therapy significantly reduced the risk of new &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/body-shape-may-predict-risk-150629683.html" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular events;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular events&lt;/a&gt; and death compared to waiting or not adding ezetimibe at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If 100% of heart attack patients received early ezetimibe alongside statins, researchers estimate 133 heart attacks could be prevented in a group of 10,000 people over three years. In the UK alone, with around 100,000 heart attacks each year, this could mean preventing 5,000 heart attacks over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Central Study Illustration. (CREDIT: Journal of the American College of Cardiology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why Earlier Treatment Matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When LDL cholesterol levels stay high after a heart attack, blood vessels remain sensitive and prone to clotting. Lowering cholesterol quickly stabilizes these vessels, cutting the chances of dangerous blockages. Yet many patients never get beyond &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-anticancer-drugs-could-significantly-improve-immunotherapy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statin therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;statin therapy&lt;/a&gt; because of delays in follow-up or treatment escalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today’s guidelines recommend stepwise addition of lipid-lowering treatment. But it’s often the case that this escalation takes too long, it’s ineffective and patients are lost to follow-up," said Margrét Leósdóttir, senior cardiology consultant at Skåne University Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezetimibe, the add-on drug examined in this study, is low-cost, widely available, and causes very few side effects. This makes it an ideal candidate for immediate use after a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/eating-this-vegetable-significantly-lowers-risk-of-heart-attacks-and-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its proven benefits, it is still not routinely given right away in most hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kausik Ray emphasized the larger impact: "This study shows that we could save lives and reduce further heart attacks by giving patients a combination of two low-cost drugs. But at the moment patients across the world aren’t receiving these drugs together. That’s causing unnecessary and avoidable heart attacks and deaths—and also places unnecessary costs on healthcare systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Proportion of Patients at LDL-C Target (LDL-C&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 01:17:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9MMjk0V1pZMjlnUEV2ekcxekRPeDFWYzVOVGdBN0J6V1c0bEJKdWxBczRLSnAzbk1taVhWSTg5SGh5emlLb0dxVTUxS2ljclpLLW41TUdFQ21vZEpacmNGQlhhR1N5emc3Q2t5SW16Um1lX3cw</guid></item><item><title>美国医生警告说，像这样吃奇亚籽会让你住院-印度时报 | US doctor warns that eating chia seeds like this can land you in the hospital - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It won't be wrong to say that chia seeds are nature's version of a multivitamin pill, metaphorically, of course! A few years ago, hardly anyone talked about chia seeds outside of hardcore health circles. Now, they’re popping up everywhere—from your favorite smoothie bowls to overnight puddings blowing up on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds have quietly transformed from a niche health food to a mainstream superfood sensation. With fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants, these small black and white seeds are now a pantry staple in health-aware kitchens globally. Their popularity stems from an increasing interest in plant-based diets and easy, natural nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts also back chia seeds for their potential to support heart health, digestive health, weight management, and even blood sugar control. In a world increasingly focused on wellness, convenience, and clean eating, chia seeds tick all the right boxes. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast, a busy professional, or just someone trying to eat a little healthier, it’s easy to see why chia seeds are becoming a pantry staple everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;However, there's a caveat!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US doctor, Dr. Joseph Salhab, who is popularly known as 'thestomachdoc' and 'Dr GI Joe' on social media has a warning for those who regularly consume chia seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says eating chia seeds directly can land you in hospital. Sharing an incident where a man, with prior swallowing issues, ate chia seeds and had to undergo surgery to get it removed after it got stuck in its food pipe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soaking chia seeds isn’t just some fancy health hack—it’s actually really important if you want to get the most out of them. When you soak chia seeds, they absorb a ton of water and form a gel-like coating. This makes them way easier for your body to digest and helps unlock all the good stuff inside, like fiber, protein, and omega-3s. If you eat dry chia seeds without soaking them first, they can pull water from your body while they’re expanding, which might cause bloating or even make you feel uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soaked chia seeds are much gentler on your stomach. They help keep things moving smoothly in your digestive system, which is a big win if you're aiming for better gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big bonus of soaking chia seeds is that it actually makes their nutrients much more available to your body. You know, chia seeds contain an outer fiber layer that's great, but it also behaves like a tiny shield, so it makes it more difficult for your body to digest them properly when they're dry. When you soak them, the seeds soften and this tends to unlock valuable nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids, so that your body is able to use and absorb them better. If you don't soak them, much of those good nutrients will simply go through your system without being properly digested. Soaking isn’t just about avoiding tummy troubles—it’s about making sure you get the full power of what chia seeds have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a practical point of view, soaked chia seeds also have a fun, pudding-like texture that’s perfect for smoothies, oatmeal, and desserts. So next time you’re about to toss a handful of chia into your meal, take a few extra minutes to soak them first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to plate your meal, as per Ayurveda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Signs of an unhealthy gut by Dr. Ishi Khosla&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 00:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwJBVV95cUxOS3JNV0pqS0g3cFdScmU4bTdTcG9kT3Ixc3pURlloZkdRNlB5RE5ObGNXd25WMGV6cVd5TWpNdXExQW9OZ1AyTlZXWm1EVExjcHhZLWZZVGEwaW50MGdveTRvWEdoUmZKVzlsbXU0MzBsNEx0cGFpWDNkQVQ4eXBfcGh5QUgyU1Q4T19Xako3NFI3R1pVOWlzWnJSd1E4a2FKT2xzejVzOXZuSWhWM3B1enFXLUtXY2EwUHA5X1dySzR3TzJ2bk1XWDl2U2d6RnhuTk8wbWM3Tl95UTZlR0JrbVNXRXUtc0dPQnB4WnFsU0dMQXYzenFCbEthbEw3SmRfZjBGc3U1S1N4VjR3SlphOVl1YlhSNzDSAZwCQVVfeXFMTjV2ckpZMVVBNlZ2Nm1WMWJ1bHl6S2k4RlpXeHZmZ09QLThtYVV0T3lnOXdSOEVZQlJFY2YtdUZEUjI2WEVXekJzLVdub0oxM1hUSDdqOVU4NVBLNWtianNxeTV0ZUtZM1JpbzdsMWpza19aOTE2emhNLXBROG9lU2w5WnVQSEpzeEJuQWpaUXotM1JaRDFlZXFUVEtRMEZJQ193UnNxSjRvcEVfNUcxY2RtWXRVMUZLWDJud3RUNzZhdnpHZTlMZW90NmRVa194a2k0dzk4emlYOXFQUzVHUVhrUVZSMTk1ajRUa19iaFltZ24yLVdLQmNZWHlWY2F5TUliNHBzcnVnTEE4MHdEVWdhQ09pMHpneGRwY3U</guid></item><item><title>40多岁的女性需要以不同的方式进食，我保证这不仅仅是为了让她们看起来更年轻- BuzzFeed | Women In Their 40s Need To Eat Differently, And I Promise It's Not Just To Make Them Look Younger - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5JZXZjU3M2Q1JfRWYzUE5vQng0LW9KQ3hsSnJ2YTJZaTEyNmlPVHBacXNzZXN5MTBBZEEtdzM5N0ZSYlZ1ZjI0elJkVlFzb3JqMUFVZ2htRERVVHNWenNmZzRwNjQzZ0VBTFZJUEpRcVVmZUJWVWJBQm5R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a woman who’s in her mid-40s, you’ve probably witnessed a number of fad diets and nutritional holy grails over the past few decades. Now that you’re (just a little bit) older and wiser, you’ve likely settled into a pattern of eating that works for you and makes you feel energized and nourished at least most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you may have noticed a few changes to your body in the past few years. “For most women, perimenopausal symptoms might have been happening since your mid-30s,” said Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/faubion-stephanie-s-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20199366" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7866826" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Stephanie Faubion&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of The North American Menopause Society and director of Mayo Clinic’s Center for Women’s Health. “The typical age to begin menopause is 45.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are changes ahead, no doubt, but you can help yourself ease into this next phase of life by making some smart nutritional choices to help yourself age as gracefully as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may already have been noticing weight gain, or a redistribution of weight, with more settling around your belly area, Faubion noted. “We lose muscle mass by 1% a year after age 50, and most adults gain about a pound and a half each year progressively through middle age,” Faubion said. But she said weight gain, while challenging, isn’t inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t exercise it all off, so you need to pay attention to what you’re eating,” she said. “You don’t have to deprive yourself, though, and you can have a beautiful, healthy diet that’s filled with fruits and vegetables.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s your "window of opportunity" to eat more nitrate-rich veggies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/midlife.strong" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7866826"&gt;Maryann Jacobsen&lt;/a&gt; is a registered dietitian and midlife health expert who noted that “many women over age 45 are at an increased risk for nutrient deficiencies, even when they eat the way they always have.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said this might be the best possible moment to switch things around on your plate. “Health experts call the time of life a ‘window of opportunity,’” she said. “That’s because the decisions we make at midlife will affect our health in our older years.” It’s a good time to up your intake of nitrate-rich vegetables such as leafy greens, celery, and beets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These help women increase their nitric oxide levels that decline with both aging and hormonal changes,” Jacobsen said. “In fact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30954341/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7866826" data-affiliate="true"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; showed that two salads a day helped increase nitric oxide-related blood flow in midlife women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also suggested a renewed focus on micronutrients, including magnesium, zinc, choline, omega-3s, iodine, B vitamins and selenium. “Aging and lower estrogen levels affect how much of those micronutrients the body absorbs,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

However, this slow, step-by-step strategy often delays getting cholesterol under control. Studies show fewer than 20% of heart attack patients reach their LDL cholesterol goals with statins alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Margrét Leósdóttir, Associate Professor at Lund University and senior cardiology consultant at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, Sweden.

For many people, the first time they get any cholesterol-lowering treatment is after their heart event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though high-intensity statins help, the majority still do not reach the recommended target of less than 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). This leaves patients vulnerable, especially in the first year after a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/blood-platelet-test-could-save-millions-of-americans-from-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; when the risk of another event is highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="new_evidence_supports_early_combination_therapy"&gt;New Evidence Supports Early Combination Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research led by Margrét Leósdóttir from &lt;a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lund University&lt;/a&gt; and Kausik Ray from &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Imperial College London&lt;/a&gt; provides strong evidence that an early combination of statins and ezetimibe can change outcomes for the better. Their study used data from 36,000 Swedish heart attack patients collected between 2015 and 2022 through the SWEDEHEART registry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying on a traditional randomized trial, which would be ethically challenging in this case, the researchers used advanced statistical modeling called a "trial emulation clone-censor-weight framework." This method allowed them to closely mimic a real-world clinical trial without putting patients at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared three groups: patients who received ezetimibe within 12 weeks of their heart attack, those who received it later (between 13 weeks and 16 months), and those who never received it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: early combination therapy significantly reduced the risk of new &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/body-shape-may-predict-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease-study-finds/"&gt;cardiovascular events&lt;/a&gt; and death compared to waiting or not adding ezetimibe at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If 100% of heart attack patients received early ezetimibe alongside statins, researchers estimate 133 heart attacks could be prevented in a group of 10,000 people over three years. In the UK alone, with around 100,000 heart attacks each year, this could mean preventing 5,000 heart attacks over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Central Study Illustration.

Lowering cholesterol quickly stabilizes these vessels, cutting the chances of dangerous blockages. Yet many patients never get beyond &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-anticancer-drugs-could-significantly-improve-immunotherapy/"&gt;statin therapy&lt;/a&gt; because of delays in follow-up or treatment escalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today’s guidelines recommend stepwise addition of lipid-lowering treatment. But it’s often the case that this escalation takes too long, it’s ineffective and patients are lost to follow-up," said Margrét Leósdóttir, senior cardiology consultant at Skåne University Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezetimibe, the add-on drug examined in this study, is low-cost, widely available, and causes very few side effects. This makes it an ideal candidate for immediate use after a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/eating-this-vegetable-significantly-lowers-risk-of-heart-attacks-and-cancer/"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its proven benefits, it is still not routinely given right away in most hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kausik Ray emphasized the larger impact: "This study shows that we could save lives and reduce further heart attacks by giving patients a combination of two low-cost drugs. But at the moment patients across the world aren’t receiving these drugs together. That’s causing unnecessary and avoidable heart attacks and deaths—and also places unnecessary costs on healthcare systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Proportion of Patients at LDL-C Target (LDL-C &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="changing_treatment_pathways_for_better_results"&gt;Changing Treatment Pathways for Better Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Skåne University Hospital, a new treatment algorithm has already been introduced based on these findings. Doctors there now routinely prescribe statins and ezetimibe together immediately after a heart attack. The results have been impressive. Within two months, twice as many patients are reaching their &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/lifesaving-drug-successfully-lowers-cholesterol-levels-and-body-weight/"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; targets compared to before the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other hospitals in Sweden have adopted similar approaches, and early results from those hospitals are just as encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My hope is that even more hospitals will review their procedures, so that more patients will get the right treatment in time, and we can thereby prevent unnecessary suffering and save lives," said Dr. Leósdóttir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research points to a straightforward solution. Ezetimibe costs about £350 per patient per year in the UK. This is a small price compared to the costs—both human and financial—of treating heart attacks and their long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Proportion of Patients Attaining the LDL-C Target of &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Ray highlighted the economic argument as well: "Our findings suggest that a simple change in treatment guidelines could have a huge impact on patients and reduce the demand on the NHS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combination therapy early after a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/charity-event-runner-helps-to-save-mans-life-after-heart-attack/"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; is not only about saving lives—it’s about using available tools more wisely and efficiently.

You can use it in salads and slaws, but you can also use it as a wrap for tacos, sandwiches and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Fatty fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish delivers protein, and when you choose a fatty fish like tuna, salmon or trout, you're also getting omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/omega-3s-may-offer-heart-and-hearing-benefits/" target="_self"&gt;Omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood and may also lower blood pressure, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/content/7-kidney-friendly-superfoods" target="_self"&gt;National Kidney Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have CKD, you may need to keep an eye on the phosphorus and potassium levels of the fish you choose. The National Kidney Foundation has &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/fish" target="_self"&gt;a chart you can use&lt;/a&gt; to determine levels in specific types of fish. Although, it's best to consult with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Jacobs Stock Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Bell peppers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like cabbage, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/bell-peppers" target="_self"&gt;bell peppers&lt;/a&gt; pack in lots of good nutrients with low levels of potassium. With them, you get vitamins B6, B9, C and K, plus fiber. They deliver antioxidants too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can slice them and eat them with dips or roast them and add them to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Cranberries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cranberries &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/news/keephealthy/newsletter/FallWinter2013/KH_Cranberry-Kidney-Connection" target="_self"&gt;help to prevent&lt;/a&gt; urinary tract infections. These usually stay in your bladder, they can travel up to your kidney, making kidney problems worse. Fortunately, regularly consuming cranberries can help you avoid this unwelcome situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-cranberries/" target="_self"&gt;cranberries&lt;/a&gt; have antioxidants that can help fight inflammation, and they can boost your heart and digestive health. It turns out, these tart berries aren't just for the Thanksgiving table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Blueberries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've talked about some of the best foods for kidneys, but you can take it a step further. The question is: What &lt;a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/what_foods_help_repair_kidneys/article.htm" target="_self"&gt;foods help repair kidneys&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-blueberries/" target="_self"&gt;Blueberries&lt;/a&gt; deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With high levels of antioxidants and loads of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/why-you-need-vitamin-c-for-immune-support-and-how-to-get-enough/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; and fiber, blueberries are all-around healthy. They can also help to reduce inflammation and support bone health, reversing some of the issues that can come with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Dark, leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons to turn to dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale. They deliver so many nutrients that they can help you get &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/gfnd/gfhnrc/docs/news-articles/2013/dark-green-leafy-vegetables#:~:text=Dark%20green%20leafy%20vegetables%20are,many%20of%20the%20B%2Dvitamins." target="_self"&gt;key vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt;, plus immunity-boosting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be advised that greens can come with a decent amount of potassium. If you have CKD, talk to your doctor before adding more of these to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich in antioxidants and healthy fatty acids, olive oil can boost your overall wellness. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy" target="_self"&gt;A study from Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; found that olive oil may lower cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and some types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond all this, it can help you add flavor to dishes without turning to salt or butter. To get more antioxidants, choose unrefined or cold-pressed olive oil that's virgin or extra virgin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Garlic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another antioxidant-rich, inflammation-fighting food, garlic also contains a specific compound called allicin. For &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618629/" target="_self"&gt;people with CKD&lt;/a&gt;, allicin — an active compound found in garlic — worked just as effectively to help protect kidney health as a prescription drug. If you're looking for the best foods for your kidneys, garlic has to make the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, it's an excellent way to add flavor when you're skimping on salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Onions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the same family as garlic, &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-onions" target="_self"&gt;onions&lt;/a&gt; give you another excellent and salt-free way to add flavor (bonus points if you saute them in olive oil). Onions also deliver important nutrients like vitamins B6 and C, manganese and copper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also contain quercetin, a chemical that can help your body fight cancer, and organic sulfur compounds that can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Cauliflower&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282844" target="_self"&gt;Cauliflower&lt;/a&gt; brings the crunch, paired with plenty of vitamins C, B6, B9 and K, along with fiber. It also contains compounds your body can use to neutralize certain toxins, a big help when your kidneys aren't doing their best filtration work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cauliflower does contain some potassium and phosphorus, though, so while it makes the list of foods good for kidneys, people with CKD may want to moderate their intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Egg whites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/programs/core-kidney/patient-resources/eating-healthy" target="_self"&gt;Egg whites&lt;/a&gt; are specifically recommended for people with kidney problems. They give you a way to increase your protein levels -- which can be important with later-stage CKD, especially if you're on dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Arugula&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/benefits-arugula" target="_self"&gt;Arugula&lt;/a&gt; is packed with nutrients your body needs like magnesium, iron, calcium and vitamins A, B9, C and K. Plus, it's antioxidant-rich and has glucosinolates, which can help your body protect itself against a range of cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can eat arugula raw (it's a great salad base), but you can also sprinkle it over whatever you're whipping up. It's great on pizzas, in omelets and with pasta, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;13. Apples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples deliver the cancer-fighting quercetin and fiber that can help to keep your cholesterol and blood sugar at healthy levels. They've got plenty of antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better yet, they're easy to work into your diet. Leave a bowl of apples on your counter and you'll have a kidney-healthy, grab-and-go snack whenever you need one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNMW9zZ1cxX0QtVjk0Y056TEp4SkhfMWM5aWN2aVNHdzdDWnI0dnVLSXJYZWhzN2h0ZDVuUjZwSXhVc09wVkZJTUZFbjVSQ2IzSU5VN2ZNS0JSOHpUOFZsWUlJTUNTMGtJVlFLRmsxcmZlTFdrNVFJemJsNFd2NC1RUXY1Smo4Y0FDUFNLdFJzRVl0UTFYWkVxYmVNZw</guid></item><item><title>报告称，父母称纽约医院的婴儿在割礼后几乎死亡- SILive.com | Parents say infant son almost died after circumcision at NYC hospital, report says - SILive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JW762WIKHBHUBEVOZKJN6RXUMY"&gt;Parents say their newborn son almost bled to death in a New York City hospital after a botched circumcision, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/baby-nearly-bled-to-death-circumcision-parents-say/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/baby-nearly-bled-to-death-circumcision-parents-say/"&gt;a new report from CBS News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IYWFZOMIXBD4FFL7DESNZTZZ3I"&gt;Parents Gabrielle and Tim Groth welcomed their new son, Cole, on March 31 at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital in Manhattan, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7F6IDJDQ2VGQ7CNTJUJ5NEGH7Y"&gt;The newborn received a stent to undergo treatment for a heart disease just days later, the outlet reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BDD7ASXTD5CV3N2VTHVVQL5BDY"&gt;After their son was eventually cleared to go home, the parents say they were asked about a circumcision but not warned that the procedure has a higher risk for complications in children with heart defects, according to the CBS report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T7MWZ3V3ZBBF7BDZBSORQMVP5E"&gt;Gabrielle and Tim Groth told CBS that their son then bled for upwards of 10 hours while in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SYQPWHRADBBXHOZRKEQZBXJQXY"&gt;“I walk in and he is extremely pale.
