                                        Most people on the planet aren't getting enough omega-3, according to an analysis out of the UK that found 76% of the global population is falling short of the recommended daily intake. The review, conducted by researchers at the University of East Anglia, the University of Southampton, and health retailer Holland &amp;amp; Barrett, is the first to compile national and international omega-3 guidelines for generally healthy people across all life stages, per &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251208052527.htm"&gt;ScienceDaily&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers say the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids like EPA and DHA are well-established, ranging from supporting infant development and reducing the risk of preterm birth to improving heart health and lowering the risk of depression and cognitive decline later in life.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        The research published in the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nutrition-research-reviews/article/an-overview-of-national-and-international-long-chain-omega3-polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-intake-recommendations-for-healthy-populations/2B7F6FD161EE90A7472B2B20909C4926"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrition Research Reviews&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt; points to a mismatch between public health guidance and what people actually consume. They also note that the recommendations themselves are inconsistent and confusing the world over. "To close that gap, we need easier, sustainable ways to get these important nutrients—like foods enriched with omega-3s or supplements," says the University of East Anglia's Anne Marie Minihane.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        The most commonly recommended intake for adults is 250mg per day of combined EPA and DHA, with pregnant women advised to get an extra 100mg to 200mg of DHA. The recommended levels can be met by eating more oily fish or taking supplements, though the researchers acknowledge that dietary preferences and sustainability concerns can get in the way. Per &lt;a href="https://nutraceuticalbusinessreview.com/study-links-higher-omega-3-levels-lower-suicidal-thoughts"&gt;Nutraceutical Business Review&lt;/a&gt;, a different &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12944-025-02689-1"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that higher omega-3 levels have been tied to a reduced risk of suicidal ideation.

Five deaths have also been reported. Both Nassau and Lee County have recorded no fatalities this year. Lee has registered four cases, while Nassau has only registered one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, at least 72 cases have been recorded across 12 states in 2025, mostly in the South, although one infection was also reported as far north as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-a66f7670-d509-11f0-bb8f-917bb609b4fd"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louisiana has seen a major uptick in Vibrio, with 26 infections and five deaths reported so far this year, well above the seven to 10 infections recorded annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vibrio are bacteria that naturally live in coastal waters, but are found in higher numbers from May to October when water temperatures rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Genevieve Gallagher, 49, caught Vibrio vulnificus after swimming at a beach off Florida's coast. She was hospitalized and doctors warned she was going into organ failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of an infection include skin redness or a rash that quickly becomes swollen or painful, fluid-filled blisters, fever, pain and an altered mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, patients may need to have limbs amputated or the bacteria can enter the blood and cause the life-threatening condition sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in five people infected with the bacteria die from the disease, the CDC says, and about 80 percent are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with weakened immune systems, older adults or those eating raw seafood are most at risk for the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Florida revealed the two new cases in an update to its statewide data on December 5, but gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The state health department warns online: 'Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally occurring bacteria in warm, brackish water. Water and wounds do not mix. Do not enter the water if you have fresh cuts and scrapes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Florida's case and fatality tally from Vibrio is below last year's, when a total of 82 infections and 19 deaths were recorded. In 2023, the state registered 46 infections and 11 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, the US recorded at least 82 cases and 19 deaths in 2024, also above the tally for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gallagher is pictured above before her infection, left, and while in the hospital. She believes the bacteria entered her left leg through an open cut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a previous case recorded in Florida this year, a 49-year-old woman nearly lost her life after she caught Vibrio while swimming in the sea off Pensacola Beach in July with her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genevieve Gallagher felt fine after the swim, but three days later her left leg began to swell and she developed agonizing blisters on its calf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed to the ER where doctors diagnosed her with Vibrio, septic shock and warned that she was going into organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gallagher told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/escambia-county/2025/09/03/vibro-bacteria-on-pensacola-beach-threatens-life-of-woman-after-swim/85830159007/"&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/a&gt;: 'It feels like somebody took gasoline, poured it on my leg, and lit my leg on fire.

The pain is unbelievable.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gallagher believes the bacteria entered her body through a 'small cut' on her left leg, which she said she had a waterproof bandage on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treated her by removing most of the muscle on her left leg up to the knee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ben West, 38, was diagnosed with Vibrio vulnificus, a severe bacterial infection that can cause kidney and liver failure. His fiancée, Jamie Knowles, took him to the hospital and has been caring for him&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists are warning that Vibrio vulnificus cases have risen nationwide in recent years (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another previous case recorded in Florida this year, Albert Allison, 88, from Collier County, was infected with Vibrio after fishing from a dock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Allison told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gulfcoastnewsnow.com/article/naples-flesh-bacteria-vibrio-fish-collier-county/66057247"&gt;Gulf Coast News Now&lt;/a&gt; that he never went into the water and was even wearing shoes, but the next day he noticed a bruise on the back of his calf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He put a bandage on it, but after the mark grew and turned a deep shade of purple, he went to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with Vibrio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Allison&lt;span&gt; was treated with antibiotics. He added, however: 'I handled the fish, and they're wet and slimy. Any, you know, it's possible that I got slime and I scratched my leg. I mean, I don't remember. I'll never know.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To treat a Vibrio infection, doctors may use antibiotics, which can clear the infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Physicians may also drain fluid from blisters and provide intravenous fluids. In serious cases, affected limbs may need to be amputated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 18:01:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究提示：白发可能是为了预防癌症而进化的- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/gray-hair-may-have-evolved-as-a-protection-against-cancer-study-hints</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;
&lt;p id="899d75a7-18a1-47b0-b795-4d66b09cb0f2"&gt;Graying hair could be a sign that the body is effectively protecting itself from cancer, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer-causing triggers, such as&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/sun-and-uv/uv-radiation.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/sun-and-uv/uv-radiation.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; &lt;u&gt;ultraviolet (UV) light&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or certain chemicals, activate a natural defensive pathway that leads to premature graying but also reduces the incidence of cancer, the research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="899d75a7-18a1-47b0-b795-4d66b09cb0f2-2"&gt;The researchers behind the study tracked the fate of the stem cells responsible for producing the pigment that gives hair its color. In mouse experiments, they found that these cells responded to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; damage either by ceasing to grow and divide — leading to gray hair — or by replicating uncontrollably to ultimately form a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad7d9898-316d-4c2b-b6bf-007d5d6eb77e"&gt;The findings, reported in October in the journal&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_4002302599642402687&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41556-025-01769-9&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fgray-hair-may-have-evolved-as-a-protection-against-cancer-study-hints" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41556-025-01769-9&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fgray-hair-may-have-evolved-as-a-protection-against-cancer-study-hints" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, underline the importance of these sorts of protective mechanisms that emerge with age as a defense against DNA damage and disease, the study authors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-16b50d28-a674-4bcc-aad6-f7a3e53d2d81" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="graying-hair-as-cancer-defense-3"&gt;Graying hair as cancer defense &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="5bb196ab-96b9-487e-b73f-507350295916"&gt;Healthy hair growth is dependent on a population of stem cells that constantly renews itself within the hair follicle. A tiny pocket within the follicle contains reserves of melanocyte stem cells — precursors to the cells that produce the melanin pigment that gives hair its color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every hair cycle, these melanocyte stem cells will divide and produce some mature, differentiated cells," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.sgul.ac.uk/dot-bennett" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.sgul.ac.uk/dot-bennett" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dot Bennett&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cell biologist at City St George's, University of London who was not involved in the study. "These migrate down to the bottom of the hair follicle and start making pigment to feed into the hair."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graying occurs when these cells can no longer produce sufficient pigment to thoroughly color each strand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ksVhsp8PbtHfP6RDqKuDoS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ksVhsp8PbtHfP6RDqKuDoS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a sort of exhaustion called cell senescence," Bennett explained. "It's a limit to the total number of divisions that a cell can go through, and it seems to be an anti-cancer mechanism to prevent random genetic errors acquired over time propagating uncontrollably."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the melanocyte stem cells reach this "stemness checkpoint," they cease to divide, meaning the follicle no longer has a source of pigment to color the hair. Ordinarily, this occurs with old age as the stem cells naturally reach this limit. However,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/aging-regeneration/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/aging-regeneration/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Emi Nishimura&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of stem cell age-related medicine, and colleagues at the University of Tokyo were interested in how this same mechanism operates in response to DNA damage — a key trigger for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse studies, the team used a combination of techniques to track the progress of individual melanocyte stem cells through the hair cycle after exposing them to different harmful environmental conditions, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/ionizing-radiation" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/ionizing-radiation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ionizing radiation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and carcinogenic compounds. Intriguingly, they found that the type of damage influenced how the cell reacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ionizing radiation caused the stem cells to differentiate and mature, and ultimately activated the biochemical pathway responsible for cell senescence. As a result, the melanocyte stem cell reserves were rapidly depleted over the hair cycle, thus halting the production of further mature pigment cells and leading to gray hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, by essentially switching off cell division, this senescence pathway prevented the mutated DNA from passing into a new generation of cells, thus lowering the likelihood of those cells forming cancerous tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to chemical carcinogens — such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/GB/en/product/sigma/d3254" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/GB/en/product/sigma/d3254" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a tumour initiator widely used in cancer research — appeared to bypass this protective mechanism. Instead of switching on senescence, it toggled on a competing cellular pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="53a902ed-cd55-4ae4-ac21-91f9620410a6"&gt;This alternative chemical sequence blocked cell senescence in the team's mouse studies, enabling the hair follicles to retain their stem cell reserves and the ability to produce pigment, even after DNA damage. That meant that the hair retained its color, but in the long term, the unchecked replication of damaged DNA led to tumor formation and cancer, the team said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can meet opposite fates depending on the type of stress they're exposed to, lead study author Nishimura said in the statement. "It reframes hair graying and melanoma [skin cancer] not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses," Nishimura added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to translate this understanding into human hair follicles, to see whether these observations in mice carry over to people, Bennett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="e1897105-2585-44b3-a7d1-e6eebd501436"&gt;

And if you’re sick, a steaming cup of whiskey, honey, lemon, and water can sound like a lot more fun than crackers and broth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But what about the alcohol? Here’s what experts say about hot toddies and colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-i-have-a-hot-toddy-when-im-sick" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I have a hot toddy when I’m sick?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Overall, it’s not a great idea, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients sometimes bring up hot toddies as a cold remedy, says Jesse Bracamonte, a family medicine physician at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. Indeed, some of the ingredients can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hot fluids, honey, and a little bit of lemon can be very therapeutic in combating a respiratory infection,” says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But there’s an important exception: “I would never recommend having alcohol with any illness,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="59efc4b2-afa6-43ab-99b5-d2f50c2d0b01" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Is love addiction real – and what does it look like?","elementId":"59efc4b2-afa6-43ab-99b5-d2f50c2d0b01","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/02/love-addiction-explained"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While drinking can cause a relaxing effect, consuming alcohol while sick can also overly sedate you, particularly if you’re taking cold and cough medications like Benadryl, Bracamonte says. Combining alcohol with medications that have sedative effects can &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/health-professionals-communities/core-resource-on-alcohol/alcohol-medication-interactions-potentially-dangerous-mixes" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increase risks&lt;/a&gt; like falling and overdose, and change how you metabolize prescriptions – people over 65 need to be especially cautious because of their slower metabolism. (Even outside hot toddy season, it’s essential to chat with your doctor about potential alcohol-medication interactions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alcohol may also weaken the immune system and slow down healing, Bracamonte says. Furthermore, drinking can cause dehydration, worsening symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The last thing you want to do when you have a cold is get dehydrated,” says Joan Blake, a registered dietician and clinical instructor at Boston University. “If you take in something that is going to dehydrate you, it’s sort of like filling a bucket with a hole in the bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s also likely that if you’re not feeling well, you’re not eating much. Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach can cause blood sugar levels to drop, says Blake. Low blood sugar can lead to dizziness. In particular, people who are diabetic or pre-diabetic need to monitor their blood sugar, Blake explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="whats-good-about-a-hot-toddy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s good about a hot toddy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you take the booze out of the equation, a non-alcoholic hot toddy could help with a cold, says Bracamonte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemon contains vitamin C, which can support the immune system, says Blake. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8264544/#B133" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests consuming vitamin C may slightly shorten the duration of the common cold (though you would probably need to consume at least &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279544/#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;200 milligrams&lt;/a&gt;; an orange has &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/sources-of-vitamin-c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about 83 milligrams&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/content/26/2/57" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4264806/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/571638#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; honey can help reduce cough frequency and discomfort. “A little bit of honey for a cough goes a long way,” says Bracamonte. A small amount of sugar, like the amount in a dollop of honey, can provide some necessary energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hydration helps with illness, especially &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4022-upper-respiratory-infection" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;upper respiratory infections&lt;/a&gt; like colds, explains Bracamonte. Staying hydrated &lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/news/five-ways-water-can-help-you-stay-healthy-1758946" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;helps your cells&lt;/a&gt; maintain a strong immune system, reduces the likelihood of headaches, and loosens mucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-eat-or-drink-to-help-with-a-cold" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you eat or drink to help with a cold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re intrigued by the idea of the hot toddy, Blake recommends adding ginger because of its anti-inflammatory components and swapping in apple cider to replace the whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even if you don’t have an appetite, it’s still important to consume a small amount of sugar, “so you can have some kind of fuel,” Blake explains. A Gatorade or its equivalent could be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Bracamonte also recommends chamomile tea as a soothing beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As for food, a 2010 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3023145/#abstract1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that eating fruits and vegetables is associated with a 20% reduction in the number of days of moderate or severe common cold symptoms. Blake also recommends classic chicken noodle soup: It is hydrating and contains a healthy balance of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ultimately, it’s important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest, says Bracamonte. Colds usually last three to seven days; if your illness lasts longer than that or if you’re having difficulty breathing, you should contact your healthcare provider for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While sipping a hot toddy might sound like a bright reprieve from the monotony of feeling sick, it’s more useful to stick to the basics: sleep, eat healthy and keep those non-boozy liquids coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNd3lJcnpFeFY1MngyVkMwb3BpSXkwcFVsRWdlRHlrWTVONE0zWDRrVHNuUE9RenpQbWN1ZFNPZUh0aWxnVWtTZDAyVmZiVjg4U092NnVvejAxNVJkMkJwdlJhRmlGeEtkMXhQMm9FNTktaFNxaWFRb2hlVDNwWDFpbUdKSWdQNG53NWxaNThuVnk2Q3JZYWc</guid></item><item><title>官员告诉俄亥俄州学校像垃圾一样扔掉72只死秃鹰事实证明他们患有禽流感- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/officials-told-ohio-school-to-trash-72-dead-vultures-like-garbage-turns-out-they-had-bird-flu-2000697260</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An Ohio elementary school recently became the site of an animal massacre you’d expect to see at the start of a horror movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staff and students at St. Bernadette’s School in Clermont County discovered 72 dead vultures on campus after returning from the Thanksgiving holiday break. It took days and mounting media pressure before state wildlife officials responded to the school’s pleas and agreed to collect and test the potentially diseased carcasses. And as it turns out, some of the birds have since tested positive for avian influenza, though the risk of infection to the public is considered low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Initially ignored&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The birds were found on campus December 1, according to local media outlet WCPO 9. School staff contacted the fire chief at Pierce Township, who reached out to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR). Despite the clear possible danger of bird flu, ODNR officials initially declined to help, saying it wasn’t part of the agency’s usual duties.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“They were very adamant that they were not coming. There was a recommendation that you just take them, put them in a bag, double-bag them and throw them in the garbage,” Pierce Township Trustee Allen Freeman &lt;a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/we-dont-know-why-the-birds-have-died-72-vultures-dead-at-clermont-county-school"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; WCPO 9. After WCPO 9’s investigative team contacted the ODNR about the situation, however, the agency changed its tune. Last Friday morning, wildlife officials arrived to collect the birds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bird die-offs can happen for various reasons, but one of the most concerning potential culprits is a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (HPAI). Remarkably, though, the ODNR still wasn’t planning to test the collected birds for flu—at least initially.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In a statement to WCPO 9, an ODNR spokesperson said that since some wild birds in the county had earlier tested positive for HPAI, all subsequent large die-offs (six or more dead birds) are presumed to be carrying the disease. However, a spokesperson for Clermont County Public Health stated that the department would indeed arrange for the testing of two birds. On Monday, the results came back, showing a presumptive positive for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A low risk, for now&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Avian influenza is a serious and growing public health threat. Experts worry that an HPAI strain can eventually evolve to spread widely between humans while causing severe illness—a combination ripe for causing the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This danger has become all the more present in the U.S. since last year, when a strain of H5N1 bird flu started to spread widely among dairy cows and other mammals. At least 71 people in the U.S. have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;caught&lt;/a&gt; H5N1 as well, while two are thought to have died from it. Just last month, a person in Washington exposed to wild birds and backyard chickens &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-human-dies-of-rare-h5n5-bird-flu-strain-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;also died&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu, albeit a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/first-ever-human-case-of-h5n5-bird-flu-found-in-washington-2000686941"&gt;different strain&lt;/a&gt; of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For now, human cases of H5N1 and other bird flu strains remain relatively rare, and the overall risk to the public is low. But the more people are exposed to infected wild birds or other carriers, the greater the chance that one day, we might not be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s all the more important to minimize these exposures as much as possible. And that’s also why it’s probably not the best idea to tell an elementary school that a bunch of dead birds isn’t a big deal to clean up on its own.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

He was soon hospitalized, ventilated and then died. Postmortem testing confirmed rabies, the CDC report said, baffling authorities because the recipient’s family had said he had not had any exposure to animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors then reviewed records about the kidney donor, a man in Idaho, and discovered that in the Donor Risk Assessment Interview (DRAI) questionnaire he said he had been scratched by a skunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When asked, the family explained that a couple of months before, in October, while he was holding a kitten in a shed on his country property, a skunk approached, showing “predatory aggression toward the kitten”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The man fought off the animal in an encounter that the report says “rendered the skunk unconscious”, but not before the man received a “shin scratch that bled”, although he did not think he had been bitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Five weeks later, a family member said, he became confused, had difficulty walking swallowing and walking, experienced hallucinations and had a stiff neck. Two days later, he was found unresponsive at home after a presumed cardiac arrest. Although he was resuscitated and hospitalized, he never regained consciousness, and after several days was “declared brain dead and removed from life support”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The report states that several of his organs, including his left kidney, were donated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After rabies was suspected in the kidney recipient, authorities went back to test laboratory samples from the donor; they tested negative for rabies. But biopsy samples directly from his kidneys did detect a strain “consistent with a silver-haired bat rabies”, suggesting that he had, in fact, died of rabies and had passed it on to the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The investigation suggested a “likely three-step transmission chain” in which a bat infected a skunk, which infected the donor, whose kidney then infected the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC said it was only the fourth reported transplant-transmitted rabies event in the United States since 1978. It noted that the risk for any transplant-transmitted infection, including rabies, is extremely low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After discovering that three people also received cornea grafts from the same donor, authorities immediately removed the grafts and administered Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent infection. The three people remained asymptomatic, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC report stated that in the US, family members often provide information about a prospective donor’s infectious disease risk factors, including animal exposures. Rabies is typically “excluded from routine donor pathogen testing because of its rarity in humans in the United States and the complexity of diagnostic testing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In this case, hospital staff members who treated the donor were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his pre-admission signs and symptoms to chronic co-morbidities,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In an interview with the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/06/health/rabies-death-skunk-kidney-transplant.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Lara Danziger-Isakov, the director of immunocompromised host infectious diseases at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, described the incident as “an exceptionally rare event”, adding that “overall, the risk is exceptionally small”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOWnhPUGlzVGYzT3Mycl8yYjFIWGYyODNseUxPdnhqMVFlLTZma0tXdDVqSC1UNnpnNi05d2VVSWZ1Um5DUUF6Z2FTUEVTemM5QzhOVkE4SXhZVEpicW5nbEZEU1pySzFWd2s0VG9uV0xqTmlOSkxMeHdlNkxLVENwRk1uZjd3NUk</guid></item><item><title>帕金森病正在上升。5个降低患病风险的专家提示- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/health/parkinson-risk-reduction-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Those are the words Dr. James Parkinson used in &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/jnp.14.2.223" target="_blank"&gt;an essay&lt;/a&gt; more than 200 years ago to group together symptoms and describe a mysterious infirmity afflicting six individuals in London. The British physician was the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/3/843/3053438" target="_blank"&gt;first to identify&lt;/a&gt; and document the condition now known as Parkinson’s disease, a progressive movement disorder. Its hallmark is damage to the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain that can lead to muscle stiffness, slowness, balance issues and a host of other problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4c8qs00083b6n84got7ze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine" target="_blank"&gt;Dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitter &lt;/a&gt;involved in our brain’s reward system. The chemical plays a central role in motivation, as well as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4084861/" target="_blank"&gt;executive function&lt;/a&gt; (which includes attention, decision-making, multitasking and planning), movement and emotional regulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            By 2021, public health researchers  reported there were &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/4/e095610" target="_blank"&gt;almost 12 million cases&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. And the number of people living with Parkinson’s is projected to &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/388/bmj-2024-080952" target="_blank"&gt;top 25 million&lt;/a&gt; by 2050. The disease not only &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-020-0117-1" target="_blank"&gt;substantially burdens&lt;/a&gt; the individual, but also their family, their community and society as a whole.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We’re now growing as a neurodegenerative disease faster than Alzheimer’s disease — that should grab everybody’s attention,” neurologist Dr. Michael Okun told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000e3b6ncmjxtj6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parkinson’s disease is so much more than just a shaking palsy, as scientists have come to learn since 1817, but there is still quite a ways to go in identifying its root causes, understanding more fully the progression of the disease, and even developing a foolproof diagnostic test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000f3b6n4ev6avjs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It becomes obvious, just absolutely obvious, when you see the folks with disease that this isn’t just a disease of dopamine; it isn’t just a disease of the brain. We see it in the gut. We see it in the skin. We see it in multiple organs,” said Okun, who cofounded and codirects the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and is the medical director and medical adviser for the Parkinson’s Foundation. “So, it is super important that we ask the why: Why does it start? Why does it progress? Why does it spread?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000g3b6na3b4m2v9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/advancing-research/our-research/pdgeneration/genetics-behind-pd" target="_blank"&gt;Genetics&lt;/a&gt; plays a key role in between 10% and 15% of cases. For many others, Okun said, the underlying cause of the disease might be more mundane and insidious: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11091623/" target="_blank"&gt;environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt; — via the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3114824/" target="_blank"&gt;the chemicals&lt;/a&gt; with which we regularly come in contact.

            “We have such an opportunity now to understand, hey, we don’t have to live in a world where we think it’s inevitable to get Parkinson’s,” Okun said. His latest book on the disease, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parkinsons-Plan-Path-Prevention-Treatment/dp/1541705386/" target="_blank"&gt;The Parkinson’s Plan&lt;/a&gt;: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment,” cowritten with Dr. Ray Dorsey, in part explores the associations between the disease and a host of chemicals that &lt;a href="https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.29371" target="_blank"&gt;quietly assail&lt;/a&gt; our bodies.

            What can you do to reduce your chances of getting Parkinson’s? Okun has a list of 25 tips in his book, and these are his five favorites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000j3b6nu10wfo7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Invest in a carbon water filter for your kitchen sink, Okun said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000k3b6nm4gw6nkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A simple carbon filter can reduce the &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/camp-lejeune/about/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/sites/lejeune/background.html" target="_blank"&gt;invisible toxicants&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186205/" target="_blank"&gt;sneak into drinking water&lt;/a&gt; and may stress vulnerable brain systems,” he said. “Clean water lowers the everyday chemical load your gut and brain must handle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000l3b6nog29wypb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These filters can reduce exposure to pesticides and chemicals like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7941732/" target="_blank"&gt;trichlorethylene, or TCE&lt;/a&gt;, a common chemical used to dry-clean clothes, decaffeinate coffee and degrease metal, as well as other impurities. (In December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency announced an almost &lt;a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/news/landmark-victory-parkinsons-community-epa-bans-trichloroethylene" target="_blank"&gt;complete ban of TCE&lt;/a&gt;, but lawsuits have so far &lt;a href="https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/27607-epa-further-delays-provisions-of-trichloroethylene-ban" target="_blank"&gt;stayed the &lt;/a&gt;rule’s effective start date under certain circumstances.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Use air purifiers both at home and work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000n3b6n0arhq5wz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Removing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8583112/" target="_blank"&gt;fine particulate matter&lt;/a&gt; from indoor air protects the nose-to-brain pathway that may seed Parkinson’s,” Okun said. “Cleaner air means fewer triggers entering through the brain’s front door.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000o3b6n6dg8yoi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Make sure to use an air purifier with a carbon filter designed to remove volatile organic chemicals, or VOCs, such as TCE. &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality#:~:text=Volatile%20organic%20compounds%20(VOCs)%20are,cosmetic%2C%20degreasing%20and%20hobby%20products." target="_blank"&gt;Volatile organic compounds are gases&lt;/a&gt; that can be emitted from solid or liquid products, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These chemicals can cause problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation and damage to the liver, kidney and central nervous system, the federal agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Take the time to wash your fruits and vegetables, even if they are organic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000r3b6nn4d2ajsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Rinsing and scrubbing your produce … helps remove pesticide residues that can quietly injure mitochondria over time,” Okun noted. “This simple daily habit lowers the exposure load your brain and nervous system must manage.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000s3b6nnkhnn86p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And just as you would when washing your hands, you should rinse them for more than 20 seconds, Okun added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Exercise every day. Regular movement is thought to prevent or delay the onset of Parkinson’s disease — and it is also crucial for people who already live with the disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000v3b6n87p5vvmv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Exercise every day, using four 20-minute walks (~7000 steps), or an equivalent routine that keeps you moving throughout the day,” Okun said via email. “Movement wakes up natural dopamine circuits, improves mobility, and may possibly slow symptom progression.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000w3b6nlbochgs9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For those who feel unsteady on their feet, Okun noted that a recumbent stationary bike is a safe and effective alternative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Prioritize  consistent, high-quality sleep to give your brain a chance to recover every night.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Deep sleep activates the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4636982/" target="_blank"&gt;brain’s built-in cleaning system&lt;/a&gt;, flushing toxins and helping symptoms improve the following day,” Okun said. “Protecting sleep is protecting brain health, especially when living with or aiming to prevent Parkinson’s.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000z3b6n10xbzrop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, when you get up in the morning, enjoy a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea. Research has consistently associated caffeine consumption with a lower risk of Parkinson’s Disease ; it is believed to protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from damage caused by environmental toxins.
    &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Back in 2023, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/ancient-roman-concrete-could-self-heal-thanks-to-hot-mixing-with-quicklime/"&gt;we reported&lt;/a&gt; on MIT scientists’ conclusion that the ancient Romans employed “hot mixing” with quicklime, among other strategies, to make their famous concrete, giving the material self-healing functionality. The only snag was that this didn’t match the recipe as described in historical texts. Now the same team is back with a fresh analysis of samples collected from a recently discovered site that confirms the Romans did indeed use hot mixing, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/noblewomans-tomb-reveals-new-secrets-of-ancient-romes-highly-durable-concrete/"&gt;reported previously&lt;/a&gt;, like today’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement" data-uri="7e5fcbf7f79050078486c69c2a8120d1"&gt;Portland cement&lt;/a&gt; (a basic ingredient of modern concrete), ancient &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_concrete" data-uri="57459e017b35b6cdf856f9fbc4b450d3"&gt;Roman concrete&lt;/a&gt; was basically a mix of a semi-liquid mortar and aggregate. Portland cement is typically made by heating limestone and clay (as well as sandstone, ash, chalk, and iron) in a kiln. The resulting clinker is then ground into a fine powder with just a touch of added gypsum to achieve a smooth, flat surface. But the aggregate used to make Roman concrete was made up of fist-sized pieces of stone or bricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his treatise &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_architectura" data-uri="eea6afa7452c7f0ebb23ac2d0cb07a89"&gt;&lt;em&gt;De architectura&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (circa 30 CE), the Roman architect and engineer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius" data-uri="3509522d11f467111a16bc495afbaac9"&gt;Vitruvius&lt;/a&gt; wrote about how to build concrete walls for funerary structures that could endure for a long time without falling into ruin. He recommended the walls be at least two feet thick, made of either “squared red stone or of brick or lava laid in courses.” The brick or volcanic rock aggregate should be bound with mortar composed of hydrated lime and porous fragments of glass and crystals from volcanic eruptions (known as volcanic tephra).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admir Masic, an environmental engineer at MIT, has studied ancient Roman concrete for several years. For instance, in 2019, Masic helped pioneer a new set of tools for analyzing Roman concrete samples from Privernum at multiple length scales—notably, Raman spectroscopy for chemical profiling and multi-detector energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for phase mapping the material. Masic was also a co-author of a &lt;a href="https://ceramics.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jace.18133"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; analyzing samples of the ancient concrete used to build a 2,000-year-old mausoleum along the Appian Way in Rome known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Caecilia_Metella" data-uri="a1e0e058f4d17139857bbc00170dfbdb"&gt;Tomb of Caecilia Metella&lt;/a&gt;, a noblewoman who lived in the first century CE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in 2023, Masic’s group analyzed samples taken from the concrete walls of the Privernum, focusing on strange white mineral chunks known as “lime clasts,” which others had largely dismissed as resulting from subpar raw materials or poor mixing. Masic et al. &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add1602"&gt;concluded that&lt;/a&gt; was not the case. Rather, the Romans deliberately employed “hot mixing” with quicklime that gave the material self-healing functionality. When cracks begin to form in the concrete, they are more likely to move through the lime clasts. The clasts can then react with water, producing a solution saturated with calcium. That solution can either recrystallize as calcium carbonate to fill the cracks or react with the pozzolanic components to strengthen the composite material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8e865027-b6bc-4a71-bca7-115096375383"&gt;New research in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2842444" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;JAMA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that more parents are opting out of giving their babies a recommended vitamin K shot at birth. And that puts babies at risk, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know unequivocally that infants that don't receive vitamin K are at significantly higher risk of getting serious bleeding," the lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vitamin-k-shot-given-at-birth-prevents-lethal-brain-bleeds-but-more-parents/" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told Scientific American&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All newborns are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/prenatal/delivery-beyond/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Administration-of-Vitamin-K.aspx" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommended to receive an injection of vitamin K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrient that helps the body form blood clots. Older children and adults get vitamin K from their diets and their gut microbiomes, but babies are born with very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutrient doesn't easily pass through the placenta and babies' microbiomes are too immature to make it; breast milk also contains relatively little vitamin K, and regardless, vitamin K given to babies by mouth isn't absorbed well. That means babies are vulnerable to vitamin K deficiency, which can lead to dangerous bleeding, and in turn, permanent brain damage or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-time vitamin K shot protects babies from this deficiency extremely effectively and safely. Since universal administration of the vitamin was started in 1961, the U.S. has "nearly eliminated" vitamin K deficiency bleeding. But now, our &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://publications.aap.org/hospitalpediatrics/article-abstract/10/3/286/26024/Refusal-of-Intramuscular-Vitamin-K-by-Parents-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;numbers are slipping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JAMA analysis found that, between 2017 and 2024, the rate of vitamin K shot refusal has risen nearly 80%, with the proportion of newborns not given the shot rising from 2.92% to 5.18%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I've seen my share of breathless, online influencers spreading misinformation about vitamin K shots. Their efforts are closely tied to — if not indistinguishable from — the anti-vaccine movement, despite vitamin K shots not being vaccines. Often, the influencers promote unproven alternatives to the shot, which they personally happen to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to put it plainly: when vitamin K administration goes down, the rate of babies dying goes up. The new JAMA study calls attention to that disturbing trend. You can learn more about the vitamin K shot from the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/149/3/e2021056036/184866/Vitamin-K-and-the-Newborn-Infant" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and their informational site, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/prenatal/delivery-beyond/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Administration-of-Vitamin-K.aspx" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Healthy Children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5ef6da5b-e0d9-433a-8ec2-24b2a863a3d9"&gt;XRISM observed comet 3I/ATLAS between Nov. 26 and Nov. 28, just as the comet moved far enough away from the sun to be visible to the telescope’s instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Comets are enveloped by clouds of gas produced as sunlight heats and vaporizes their icy surfaces," XRISM representatives wrote in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xrism.jaxa.jp/en/topics/news/1208/" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "When this gas interacts with the energetic stream of charged particles flowing from the Sun — the solar wind — a process called charge-exchange reaction occurs, producing characteristic X-ray emission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers described the glow in the X-ray image as a "faint emission structure" and said it was potentially the result of a diffuse cloud of gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers also noted that instrumental effects such as vignetting or detector noise can create similar structures in images, so they'll have to do follow-up analysis to confirm whether the extensive emission structure belongs to the comet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Moving forward, the XRISM team will continue refining its data processing and analysis to further reveal the activity of this interstellar comet and the nature of its interaction with the solar wind," the representatives wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ac4e2500-487a-4ec7-9a67-9aaec035f2c9"&gt;2025 is set to tie for the second-warmest year on record, the European Union's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2025-course-be-joint-second-warmest-year-november-third-warmest-record" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copernicus Climate Change Service&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November, this year is tied with 2023 for annual global surface temperature, but the temperature is slightly cooler than it was in 2024, the warmest year on record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest data suggests that next month we'll be able to say that the last three years were the warmest on record — an ominous consequence of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers measure global temperature rise above the estimated average temperature between 1850 and 1900, known as pre-industrial levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World leaders promised to limit this warming to preferably below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) and well below 3.6 F (2 C) in the 2015 Paris Agreement, adopted at the United Nations' COP21 climate conference. Unfortunately, they're failing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="0eef2021-c354-400a-95af-fb3eb74d1e70"&gt;"For November, global temperatures were 1.54 C above pre-industrial levels, and the three-year average for 2023–2025 is on track to exceed 1.5 C for the first time," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/samantha-burgess" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Samantha Burgess&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the strategic lead for climate at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which implements the Copernicus program, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2025-course-be-joint-second-warmest-year-november-third-warmest-record" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These milestones are not abstract — they reflect the accelerating pace of climate change and the only way to mitigate future rising temperatures is to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Burgess added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth remembering that last month, climate deliberations at the COP30 conference in Brazil ended in an underwhelming compromise. The final text of the COP30 agreement didn't contain any &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/22/roadmaps-adaptations-and-transitions-what-climate-measures-were-agreed-at-cop30" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clear mention of fossil fuels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are the primary source of increased greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8edf36cc-9124-4b5d-8879-fc14311af94c"&gt;EngineAI said that the purpose of the simulated fight was to counter claims that its latest model was a CGI creation, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/07/world/video/engineai-chinese-ceo-kicked-by-humanoid-robot-t800-digvid" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CNN reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the T800 appears to have a decent kick, it doesn't go unnoticed that Tongyang was standing still, waiting patiently for his robot to strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, don't expect to see robots beating UFC fighters anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1dbf24f0-316b-4855-aaaa-d13a4857b5bb"&gt;A Herculean effort to search for dark matter has found no evidence for the elusive substance. That's the takeaway from a gigantic particle detector located a mile underground in South Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 417-day-long experiment, known as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), looked at the light signatures released as particles collide with xenon atoms in a giant vat, which is placed deep underground so that most particles from space cannot muddy the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark matter, which emits no light yet exerts gravitational force, is thought to make up most of the universe. And the new findings tightly constrain the properties of one the leading candidates for dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read all about why scientists are actually happy about these negative results in contributor &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/author/elizabeth-howell" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/author/elizabeth-howell"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Elizabeth Howell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/particle-physics/historic-search-for-huge-missing-piece-of-the-universe-turns-up-negative-but-reveals-new-secrets-of-particle-physics" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/particle-physics/historic-search-for-huge-missing-piece-of-the-universe-turns-up-negative-but-reveals-new-secrets-of-particle-physics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;story here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="f0cb25bc-14eb-4c61-99a6-6fb0975a9585"&gt;A tsunami has hit Japan following a magnitude 7.6 earthquake off the northeastern coast of Honshu, the country's main island, earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html#6/42.692/145.789/&amp;amp;elem=warn&amp;amp;contents=tsunami&amp;amp;lang=en" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Japan Meteorological Agency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has recorded tsunami waves hitting Japan's eastern coastline. The precise height of the waves is unclear at this time, but most are in the 3-foot-tall (1 meter) or less category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no reported deaths at this time, although there are some reports of injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="a20d76ea-e4e8-40fb-8f54-b073644b85fb"&gt;Japan has downgraded its tsunami warning to a tsunami advisory. The initial warning meant that the authorities &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.data.jma.go.jp/multi/tsunami/tsunami_advisory.html?lang=en" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;expected a maximum tsunami height&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of between 3.3 feet and 9.8 feet (1 and 3 m).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, an "advisory" level means that the expected maximum height has been reduced to 3.3 feet, in keeping with the wave heights recorded thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

CMEs have the potential to clash with Earth's magnetic field and trigger geomagnetic storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow's strong geomagnetic storm forecast is associated with the eruption of a solar flare on Saturday. The resulting CME is predicted to arrive at midday tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Space Weather Prediction Center noted that the CME could also have limited, minor effects on technological infrastructure, but this can usually be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;

The Space Weather Prediction Center recorded another powerful &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/x11-flare-was-observed-080501-utc" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;solar flare&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier today.

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I went to see our family doctor because my arm was hurting for over a week. He diagnosed it as 'tennis elbow' and told me to take anti-inflammatories. Weeks later, I lost most of the feeling in my hand, so I was given nerve conduction tests, then imaging. It turned out I had under 50% of the normal nerve conduction, because I'd originally broken my arm and it healed badly, crushing the nerve in my elbow. I needed urgent surgery to chisel away the extra bone around the nerve. The neurosurgeon doing the operation injected the local anesthetic and waited for it to go numb. He checked my sensation and I could feel everything. Another shot. Same result. I told him to go ahead and I'd just put up with it. It was a tad painful, to say the least. If you imagine somebody literally chiselling away at your funny bone carefully for 4 hours, you'll get some idea. The nurse on my side said she'd never seen someone in that much pain before."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"At least the operation was successful, though the surgeon afterwards said he should have done it under a general anesthetic. I agree! 😩"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, Jamie, UK&lt;/p&gt;

As you can probably guess, one of those goldens is named Leia. And Leia's got a new younger sister, Daisy. Only one problem. According to a recent 10-second TikTok video, Daisy has Leia "contemplating her new life," in which she has a pesky younger sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video is captioned "Leia's contemplating her new life" and begins with Leia putting her front legs up on the couch, while her human parent films the interaction. Leia is trying hard to get away from Daisy, who is also standing on her hind legs and putting her front paws on the couch, mimicking her older sister and also getting closer to their human parent. The video captions what they imagine Leia is saying: "Mom, she's bothering me again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;"Mom, She's Bothering Me Again"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Daisy then moves in closer, putting her paws on her big sister, Leia. Leia immediately tries hard again to move away, and the caption on the screen reads, "Ew, too close." Daisy leans in even harder, putting her head on Leia, and the caption switches to narrating what Daisy must be thinking. "But sister, I just want to playyy," the caption says. Then the video pans back to show just a close-up of Leia's face with the caption reading, "Can we return this thing?" And that's how the video ends!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/puppy-thought-getting-versus-puppy-230500896.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: 'Puppy I Thought I Was Getting' Versus 'Puppy I Got' Video Is Cracking People Up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: 'Puppy I Thought I Was Getting' Versus 'Puppy I Got' Video Is Cracking People Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some other TikTok users chime in in the comments with their own narrations of what Leia must be thinking and trying to communicate. "Can we return it? I'll drop her off at FedEx," TikTok user @balian76 commented. "Get this thing away from me," another TikTok user adds. "Excuse me, Mother, but this is unbearable. I simply can't even," TikTok user @MissKate also comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are many benefits to getting another dog as a companion for your current dog. The first benefit is just that—companionship. Especially if you're frequently out of the house for work or travel, this can give your dog some social interaction and a friend to keep them company. It's also a good way to increase your dog's activity. Younger dogs have more energy and love to play, keeping your older dog engaged and active. There are, of course, some things to consider. Mostly, it's important to be absolutely certain that both you and your current dog can handle the significant lifestyle change and all that comes with owning two dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-thinks-hes-invisible-110500419.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Golden Retriever Who Thinks He's Invisible While Stalking His Brother Has Us in Stitches;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Golden Retriever Who Thinks He's Invisible While Stalking His Brother Has Us in Stitches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-contemplating-new-life-with-puppy-tiktok" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PetHelpful;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PetHelpful&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 9, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pet News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pet News&lt;/a&gt; section.

In it, 20 adults ate one of two diets, which were identical in nutrients and differed only in their level of processing. Participants who ate ultra-processed foods (UPFs) consumed about 500 kilocalories more per day and gained weight, whereas those on a minimally processed diet lost weight. The results offered strong evidence that many industrially produced foods can override satiety signals and drive overeating. And it made Hall one of the most influential figures in nutritional science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02754-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51412508.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Are ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understandably, expectations were high for his book, &lt;i&gt;Food Intelligence&lt;/i&gt;, co-written with Canadian journalist Julia Belluz. It digs deeper into the implications of the 2019 study — that the harms of processed foods can’t be reduced to their fat, sugar or salt content alone, and that the prevalent government strategy of politely asking companies to tweak their recipes by cutting salt or sugar content, say, is unlikely to address rising obesity rates. Unfortunately, the execution only partly lives up to the promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this wide-ranging primer on food science, Hall and Belluz revisit many food-related misconceptions. They debunk the idea that cutting 500 kilocalories a day reliably leads to the loss of half a kilogram a week and that “broken metabolism” explains obesity — as Hall showed in his studies on contestants who participated in &lt;i&gt;The Biggest Loser&lt;/i&gt;, a reality television programme built around extreme weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04163-x" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51793264.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Are you what you eat? How food shapes self-image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors challenge the current obsession with protein, noting that most people already consume enough through ordinary diets. They are equally dismissive of the booming supplements industry, arguing that many products lack clinical evidence or have been shown to offer no real benefit. Their scepticism extends to continuous glucose monitoring in people without diabetes, which they warn might provoke needless anxiety without providing clear advantages. The critique culminates in a forceful take down of the personalized-nutrition industry — diet plans based on genetics, which they argue have no solid scientific basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limited legislation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracing the origins of the limited control the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exerts over food additives and supplements, the authors provide valuable context for why the US food environment is particularly problematic. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ensured that dietary supplements do not require premarket approval. The FDA also allows companies to introduce additive chemicals into food if these are merely ‘&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;generally recognized as safe&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lax regulatory framework, shaped heavily by food-industry lobbying, stands in stark contrast to the stricter regimes in much of Europe and Latin America. Some countries now warn the public about highly processed foods, yet nutrition-guideline committees in the United States and United Kingdom still decline to mention them as potentially harmful, even as the FDA has been asked to consider the issue in its upcoming review.

The authors insist that the real challenge lies in reshaping the “toxic food environment” that drives overconsumption. They call for tighter regulation and greater transparency on additives, reformulation of industrial products, and taxes on ultra-processed foods to shift diets towards whole foods, fruit and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a powerful message, and one that deserves wider attention, even if the book’s practical diet suggestions are underwhelming: eat less meat, eat more fruit and vegetables, and store junk food out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;A barrage of &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/social-media-children-brain-rot"&gt;AI-generated brain rot&lt;/a&gt; is haunting children across numerous screens, from personal smartphones to school-issued laptops to televisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Social media is adding significantly to that cacophony, making it harder than ever for kids to concentrate. Now, new research from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University has found a significant link between screen time and diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), suggesting that exposing young brains to social media could have major mental health implications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatricsopenscience/article/doi/10.1542/pedsos.2025-000922/205729/Digital-Media-Genetics-and-Risk-for-ADHD-Symptoms?autologincheck=redirected" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics Open Science&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers followed 8,324 children aged nine to ten years old in the US for four years. The children self-reported how much time they spent on social media, watching TV, or playing video games. Their parents also assessed their ability to pay attention and any signs of hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;There was a clear link between social media use and an attention deficit, raising the possibility that the constant sensory assault by online services like TikTok and Snapchat could be robbing kids of the ability to focus. That’s in contrast to TV or video game use, which showed no clear association with symptoms of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate,” said coauthor and Karolinska Institutet professor of cognitive neuroscience Torkel Klingberg in a &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/using-social-media-may-impair-childrens-attention" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The researchers found that over the four years, children went from spending an average of 30 minutes a day to 2.5 hours a day on social media. Meanwhile, inattention symptoms also increased.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction,” Klingberg added. “This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;While it’s always hard to figure out causation in research like this, one clue is that children who were already struggling with symptoms of ADHD at the outset of the study didn’t start using social media more, suggesting that its use leads to inattentiveness, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Importantly, there was no evidence of reverse association, as average inattention symptoms did not predict increased social media use,” the paper reads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Interestingly, an increase in social media use was shown to have no effect on hyperactivity, which is also a symptom associated with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Although the effect size is small at the individual level, it could have significant consequences if behavior changes across population level,” the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As such, the number of ADHD diagnoses in the US is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/05/23/1252941968/adhd-diagnoses-are-rising-1-in-9-u-s-kids-have-gotten-one-new-study-finds" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;rising&lt;/a&gt;. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2024.2335625" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt;, one in nine US kids is now living with the disorder, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizing it as an “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/19960/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;expanding public health concern&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As of 2022, there were over seven million kids and adolescents in the US with a diagnosis of the condition, up from just over six million in 2016, a significant rise in only a matter of six years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;According to Klingberg, social media may have contributed to the trend over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Greater consumption of social media might explain part of the increase we’re seeing in ADHD diagnoses, even if ADHD is also associated with hyperactivity, which didn’t increase in our study,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The researchers stressed that their findings didn’t establish explicit, causative links and that social media use doesn’t necessarily imply a child will develop ADHD symptoms. However, they suggest parents should discuss limiting the time children spend on social media each day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We hope that our findings will help parents and policymakers make well-informed decisions on healthy digital consumption that support children’s cognitive development,” said first author and Karolinska Institutet postdoctoral researcher Samson Nivins, in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

Mice fed AL were allowed free access to food at all times and never ran out of food. The mice on the DR regimen received 50% of their average daily (normal) intake of food. Mice on DR were given pre-weighed pellets between 09:00 h and 11:00 h every day of the experiment. Following 1 week on their respective diet, mice were subcutaneously injected with 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (EO771) or 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (B16-OVA) cells into the right abdominal flank. Tumour volume was measured every 2–3 days with a calliper once tumours became palpable. Tumour initiation was scored as a tumour volume of ≥250 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Mice were euthanized when the tumour volume reached 1,500 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For experiments involving anti-PD1 treatment, mice received 200 µg of IgG (BP0091; RRID: AB_1107773) or anti-PD1 (BP0033-2; RRID:AB_1107747) antibodies intraperitoneally every 3 days, for a total of five injections (1 mg of antibody total). Treatment was initiated 7 days after tumour cell injection. The maximal tumour size permitted by the ethical regulations was 1,500 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and this limit was not exceeded in any experiment. Animals were monitored regularly for signs of discomfort or distress, and any animal reaching predefined humane endpoints was euthanized in accordance with approved protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;TIL isolation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIL were isolated from palpable tumours 12–14 days post tumour cell injection. Tumours were mechanically homogenized in a six-well plate and then passed through a 100 µm cell strainer, followed by a 40 µm cell strainer. The single-cell suspension was incubated with red blood cell lysis buffer for 1 min at 20–22 °C (room temperature), after which three volumes of T cell media (TCM) were added to halt the lysis reaction. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 RCF for 5 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of TCM and processed for flow cytometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19"&gt;Mouse T cell isolation and culture&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells were purified from mouse spleens through negative selection using magnetic bead-based isolation kits (StemCell Technologies). T cells were cultured in TCM: Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM; Wisent) containing 10% Nu-Serum IV culture supplement (Corning), 50 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin, 50 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin (Gibco), 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and 2 mM &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-glutamine (Gibco; final concentration 6 mM). T cells (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells per ml) were activated in vitro by stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3ε (clone 145-2C11; 2 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51; 1 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) antibodies for 48 72 h.

MS parameters were as follows: source voltage −2,500V; sheath gas, 60; aux gas, 19; sweep gas, 1; ion transfer tube temperature, 320 °C; and vaporizer temperature, 250 °C. Full scan data were collected using an Orbitrap with a scan range of 70–850 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; at a resolution of 240,000 and RF lens at 35%. Fragmentation was induced in the Orbitrap using assisted higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) collision energies at 15, 30 and 45%. Orbitrap resolution was 15,000, the isolation window was 2 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; and data-dependent scans were capped at five scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For acetyl-CoA measurements, samples were analysed with a Vanquish liquid chromatography system coupled to an Orbitrap ID-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an H-ESI source in positive mode. A total of 2 μl of each standard and/or sample was injected and run through a 5-min reversed-phase chromatography Cortecs T3 Column (1.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm; Waters, 186008500) combined with a Cortecs T3 VanGuard Pre-column (1.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm; Waters, 186008508). Mobile phase A consisted of 100% LC–MS-grade water (Fisher, W6), 0.01% ammonium hydroxide (Fisher, A470) and 5 mM ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, 73594), and mobile phase B consisted of 99% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile (Fisher, A955). Column temperature was kept at 30 °C, flow rate was held at 0.3 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the chromatography gradient was as follows: 0–0.5 min held at 0% B; 0.5–1 min from 0% B to 10% B; 1–4 min from 10% B to 50% B; 4–4.1 min from 50% B to 99% B; and 4.1–5 min held at 99% B. A 5-min wash gradient was run between every injection to flush the column and to re-equilibrate solvent conditions as follows: 0–2 min held at 100% B; 2–3 min from 100% B to 0% B; and 3–5 min held at 0% B. MS parameters were: source voltage, 3,500 V; sheath gas, 70; aux gas, 25; sweep gas, 1; ion transfer tube temperature, 300 °C; and vaporizer temperature, 250 °C. A targeted single ion scan was performed in the Orbitrap to target acetyl-CoA and all of its carbon-13 isotopologues with a centre mass of 810.133 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; and an isolation window of 48 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;. Resolution was set at 60,000, RF lens at 60% and scan time was set for 2–4 min of the chromatographic gradient described above. Data-dependent MS2 fragmentation was induced in the Orbitrap using assisted HCD collision energies at 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% as well as with collision-induced dissociation (CID) at a collision energy of 35%. For both MS2 fragmentations, Orbitrap resolution was 30,000, the isolation window was 1 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; for HCD and 1.5 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; for CID, and the total cycle time was 0.6 s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For βOHB quantification in serum and tumours, metabolites were extracted with a 40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol and 20% water solution. An external standard curve for βOHB was generated from 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to 0.01 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; by half-log serial dilutions. Standards were processed identically to tissue and serum samples throughout the workflow. Tissues were extracted at a concentration of 40 mg tissue per ml, and serum at 40 µl serum per ml of extraction solvent. Extracts were dried and reconstituted in water (200 µl for tissue, 1 ml for serum) containing 100 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of internal standard ([U-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]-βOHB). Samples and standards were analysed on an Orbitrap Exploris 240 (Thermo) in ESI-negative mode using tributylamine ion-paired chromatography as described above. Data were processed using Skyline, and internal standard-normalized peak areas were used to calculate βOHB concentrations, which are reported in units of mg g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for tissues and mM for serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Lipidomics analyses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipidomics samples were analysed with a Thermo Vanquish dual liquid chromatography system using two alternating methods, referred to as chromatography 1 and chromatography 2, coupled to an Orbitrap ID-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an H-ESI source in positive and negative mode, respectively. A total of 2 μl of each standard and/or sample was injected, column temperatures were kept at 50 °C and the flow rate was held at 0.4 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. For both chromatography 1 and 2, mobile phase A consisted of 60% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific, A955), 40% LC–MS grade water (Fisher Scientific, W6), 0.1% LC–MS-grade formic acid (Fisher Scientific, A117) and 10 mM ammonium formate (Fisher Scientific, 70221), and mobile phase B consisted of 90% LC–MS-grade isopropanol (Fisher Scientific, A461), 8% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile, 2% LC–MS-grade water, 0.1% LC–MS-grade formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate. Chromatography 1 used a 30-min reversed-phase chromatography Accucore C30 column (2.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 27826-152130) combined with an Accucore C30 guard column (2.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 10 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 27826-012105), and the gradient was as follows: 0–1 min held at 25% B; 1–3 min from 25% B to 40% B; 3–19 min from 40% B to 75% B; 19–20.5 min 75% B to 90% B; 20.5–28 min from 90% B to 95% B; 28–28.1 min from 95% B to 100% B; and 28.1–30 min held at 100% B. A 30 min wash gradient was run between every injection (in parallel with chromatography 2) to flush the column and to re-equilibrate solvent conditions as follows: 0–2 min held at 100% B and 0.3 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 2–2.1 min from 100% B to 25% B and held at 0.3 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 2.1–4 min held at 25% B and ramp to 0.4 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 4–6 min held at 25% B and ramp to 0.6 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 6–17 min held at 25% B and 0.6 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 17–17.1 min held at 25% B and ramp to 0.4 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; and 17.1–30 min held at 25% B and 0.4 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Chromatography 2 used a 30-min reversed-phase chromatography Acquity UPLC CSH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm; Waters, 186005297) combined with a a VanGuard pre-column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm; Waters, 186005303), and the gradient was as follows: 0–1 min held at 25% B; 1–3 min from 25% B to 40% B; 3–4 min from 40% B to 50% B; 4–16 min from 50% B to 65% B; 16–17 min from 65% B to 70% B; 17–25 min from 70% B to 75% B; 25–27 min from 75% B to 100% B; and 27–30 min held at 100% B. A 30-min wash gradient was run between every injection (in parallel with chromatography 1) that used the same gradient as the chromatography 1 wash gradient. For both methods, MS parameters were as follows: source voltage, +3,250 V or −3,000 V depending on method polarity; sheath gas, 40; aux gas, 10; sweep gas, 1; ion transfer tube temperature, 300 °C; and vaporizer temperature, 275 °C. Full scan data were collected using the Orbitrap with a scan range of 200-1,700 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;at a resolution of 500,000 and RF lens at 45%. Data-dependent MS2 fragmentation was induced in the Orbitrap using assisted HCD collision energies at 15, 30, 45, 75 and 110% as well as with CID at a collision energy of 35%. For both MS2 fragmentations, Orbitrap resolution was 15,000, and the isolation window was 1.5 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;. A &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 184 mass trigger, indicative of phosphatidylcholines, was used for CID fragmentation. Data-dependent MS3 fragmentation was induced in the ion trap with the scan rate set at Rapid, using CID at a collision energy of 35%. MS3 scans were triggered by specific acyl chain losses for detailed analysis of mono-, di- and triacylglycerides. Total cycle time was 2 s. Lipid identifications were assigned using LipidSearch (v.5.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For data analysis, peak picking and integration was conducted in Skyline (v.22-23) using in-house curated compound lists of accurate mass MS1 and retention time of chemical standards&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 69" title="House, R.

Red blood cells were lysed using red blood cell lysis buffer containing 0.15 M NH₄Cl, 10 mM KHCO₃ and 0.1 mM EDTA, followed by neutralization with three volumes of TCM. For cell staining, single-cell suspensions were incubated with a cocktail of fluorescently labelled antibodies and dyes as listed in the Key Resources Table. Cell viability was assessed using Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. To assess cytokine production following &lt;i&gt;Lm&lt;/i&gt;OVA infection, splenocytes collected from infected mice at 7 dpi were stimulated with 1 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; OVA&lt;sub&gt;257–264&lt;/sub&gt; peptide (Anaspec) and 50 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; IL-2 for 4 h at 37 °C. TIL were re-stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. GolgiStop protein transport inhibitor (BD Biosciences) was added at a 1:1,500 dilution during the last 2 h of incubation to block cytokine secretion. After stimulation, cells were stained with surface marker antibodies in staining buffer (PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.02% sodium azide) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C for 1 h. Intracellular staining was performed by incubating cells with fluorescently labelled antibodies targeting intracellular markers for either 1 h or overnight at 4 °C. Flow cytometry data were acquired using a CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter), Aurora Cytek or BD Accuri C6 Plus cytometer. Cell sorting was performed on an Astrios (Beckman Coulter) or BD FACSAria Fusion cell sorter. Data analysis was conducted using FlowJo software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;CITE-seq experimental protocol&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;C57BL/6J mice aged 10–12 weeks were allocated to either AL feeding or DR for 1 week before tumour cell injection. Following the feeding regimen, each mouse was subcutaneously injected with 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; B16-OVA melanoma cells. At 13 dpi, tumours were dissected from the mice for further analysis. To prepare single-cell suspensions, excised tumours were mechanically dissociated and filtered sequentially through 100 µm and then 50 µm cell strainers. Throughout all procedures, cells were kept on ice to preserve viability. The resulting cell suspensions were counted, and cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. To prevent nonspecific antibody binding, cells were blocked with TruStain FcX Plus (BioLegend, 156603) in Cell Staining Buffer (CSB; BD Biosciences, 420201) for 10 min at 4 °C. Each tumour sample was then labelled with a specific antibody (Hashtags 1–8, product information in Key Resource Table) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, including appropriate incubation and washing steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After hashtag labelling, cells were stained with a panel of fluorescently labelled antibodies targeting surface markers to identify live CD45⁺ leucocytes while excluding red blood cells (Ter119⁻), tumour cells (CD105⁻) and dead cells (DAPI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). This staining facilitated the isolation of the desired cell population during flow cytometric sorting. Cells were sorted by flow cytometry, and live CD45⁺ cells were collected into tubes containing IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS. After sorting, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in CSB, and cell viability was reassessed. Based on cell counts, CD45⁺ cells were adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells per 50 µl and blocked again with TruStain FcX Plus for 10 min at 4 °C. During this blocking step, TotalSeq C antibodies were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BioLegend). The TotalSeq C antibodies were then added to the CD45⁺ cells and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C to label cell surface proteins for subsequent analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following antibody staining, cells were washed three times with CSB to remove unbound antibodies. Cells were then resuspended in 1× PBS containing 0.04% pure BSA at an approximate concentration of 2,200 cells per µl. The prepared cell suspension was used for downstream library preparation and sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;CITE-seq library preparation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libraries were generated and sequenced by the VAI Genomics Core. Cells were processed with 10× Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5ʹ GEM kit (v.1.1) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to target an output of 13,000 cells per sample using a 10× Genomics Chromium Controller. In brief, single-cell suspensions in PBS + 0.04% BSA were assessed for quantity and viability on the CytoFLEX S (Beckman Coulter), then 20,000 cells per sample were loaded onto the Chromium Controller. Single cells were captured in gel beads in emulsion, where they were lysed. Released RNA was barcoded and then converted to cDNA. Using beads, cDNA was separated from the hashtag oligonucleotides (HTO), and each was used to generate adaptor-ligated libraries. Quality and quantity of the finished gene expression and HTO libraries were assessed using a combination of Agilent DNA High Sensitivity Chip (Agilent Technologies) and QuantiFluor dsDNA System (Promega). Then, 2 × 100 bp, paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using an S2, 200-cycle sequencing kit (v.1.5) to a minimum depth of 20 K reads per cell. Base calling was done by Illumina RTA3, and output was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format with Cell Ranger (10× Genomics, v.3.1.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;CITE-seq quality control and processing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following library preparation, FastQ files were processed using Cell Ranger (v.7.0.1) to map and quantify expression profiles for both the transcriptome and epitopes. Single-cell 5′ paired-end sequencing chemistry was used, and the sequencing data were aligned to the mouse reference genome m10-2020-A. The resulting raw_feature_bc_matrix, containing both transcript-level and epitope quantifications, was imported into R using the Read10X function from the Seurat package (v.5.0.0). Initial data processing involved separating the gene expression (GEX) data, ADTs and HTOs, which was critical for downstream analysis. A Seurat object was created using the CreateSeuratObject function. Quality control and normalization steps were then performed: HTO data were normalized using the NormalizeData function with the method set to ‘CLR’ (centred log ratio transformation), and the HTODemux function was used to classify cells based on HTO signals into ‘singlets’, ‘doublets’ and ‘negative’ categories. Further quality control filtering was applied by retaining cells with ADT counts of at least 150, RNA counts of at least 200, an HTO classification of ‘singlet’ and mitochondrial gene expression percentage less than 20%. The GEX matrix was normalized using the SCTransform function (sctransform v.0.4.1), and ADT data were normalized using the NormalizeData function. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on both RNA and ADT data using the RunPCA function, including all ADTs for dimensionality reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To generate a joint uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) embedding that integrates both GEX and ADT data, the FindMultiModalNeighbors function was used, followed by the RunUMAP function, resulting in a weighted nearest-neighbour UMAP. Cluster identification was achieved by integrating gene expression profiles, ADT data and gene expression density visualizations using the plot_density() function from the Nebulosa package (v.1.14.0). Details of cluster identification are provided in Supplementary Tables&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01415-6#MOESM1"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01415-6#MOESM1"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Figs.&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01415-6#Fig9"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01415-6#Fig13"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;. Statistical analyses for violin plots were performed using the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon comparison tests with Bonferroni &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value adjustment. Sequencing data from the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE267070"&gt;GSE267070&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;RNA velocity estimation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To infer cellular trajectories from the scRNA-seq data, we performed RNA velocity analysis using the Python implementation of Velocyto (v.0.17.17), following previously described methods&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="La Manno, G. et al.

In brief, spliced and unspliced counts were generated using the velocyto run10x subcommand, outputting a loom file for importing into Python or R. Next, we used scvelo to infer RNA velocity vectors and projected them onto the UMAP embeddings generated above. This approach enabled us to determine the directional changes of cells between dietary conditions.

In brief, cells were resuspended in 50 µl of lysis solution and proteins were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23227) following the vendor-supplied protocol. Plates were read at an absorbance of 562 nm using the Synergy LX Multi-Mode Reader, and Gen5 software was used for data analysis (BioTek/Agilent). Polynomial regression was used in the Gen5 software to calculate protein concentrations from a protein standard curve after an average blank absorbance subtraction. Then, 25 µg of protein per sample was reduced and alkylated at 95 °C for 10 min, and samples were digested overnight with Trypsin/Lys-C at 30 °C at a ratio of 10:1 (protein:enzyme (w/w)). Resulting peptides were cleaned with the supplied peptide clean-up columns in the EasyPep mini kit and then dried down in a Genevac SpeedVac before resuspension for instrument analysis. Samples were resuspended in 12.5 µl 0.1% formic acid (Fisher Scientific, LS118-1) and diluted 1:1 with 6 µl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Fisher Scientific, LS119-500) in autosampler vials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;Data-independent acquisition LC–tandem MS proteomics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data-independent acquisition analyses were performed on an Orbitrap Eclipse coupled to a Vanquish Neo system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a FAIMS Pro source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) located between the nanoESI source and the mass spectrometer. A total of 2 μg of digested peptides were separated on a nano capillary column (20 cm × 75 μm inner diameter, 365 μm outer diameter, 1.7 μm C18; CoAnn Technologies, HEB07502001718IWF) at 300 nl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Mobile phase A consisted of LC–MS-grade H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Fisher Scientific, LS118-500), mobile phase B consisted of 20% LC–MS-grade H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and 80% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific, LS122500), both containing 0.1% formic acid. The LC gradient was 1% B to 24% B in 110 min; 85% B in 5 min; and 98% B for 5 min; with a total gradient length of 120 min. The column temperature was kept constant at 50 °C using a customized column heater (Phoenix S&amp;amp;T). For FAIMS, the selected compensation voltage was applied (−40 V, −55 V and −70 V) throughout the LC–MS/MS runs. Full MS spectra were collected at 120,000 resolution (full width half-maximum; FWHM), and MS2 spectra at 30,000 resolution (FWHM). Both the standard automatic gain control target and the automatic maximum injection time were selected. A precursor range of 380–985 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; was set for MS2 scans, and an isolation window of 50 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; was chosen with a 1 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; overlap for each scan cycle; 32% HCD collision energy was used for MS2 fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data-independent acquisition data were processed in Spectronaut (v.19; Biognosys) using direct data-independent acquisition. Data were searched against the &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; proteome. The manufacturer’s default parameters were used. In brief, trypsin/P was set as the digestion enzyme, and two missed cleavages were allowed. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification, and methionine oxidation and protein amino-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. Identification was performed using a 1% &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; value cutoff on precursor and protein levels. Both peptide precursors and protein false discovery rate (FDR) were controlled at 1%. Ion chromatograms of fragment ions were used for quantification. For each targeted ion, the area under the curve between the XIC peak boundaries was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Proteomic data processing and GSEA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteomic values were imported into R from an Excel file and processed with dplyr and readxl. Replicate columns for each condition (AL-WT, AL-DKO, DR-WT, DR-DKO) were coerced to numeric and averaged to obtain per-protein means. Differential abundance was calculated as log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(fold change) (for example, DR-WT / AL-WT), and Welch’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests were performed between the corresponding replicate groups to obtain &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. Proteins lacking sufficient replicate measurements were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For GSEA, proteins were mapped to gene symbols (duplicated symbols collapsed by the entry with the largest absolute log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(fold change). A pre-ranked vector was generated using the sign of the log2(fold change) multiplied by −log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value) (equivalent results were obtained using log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(fold change) alone). Mouse gene sets were retrieved from MSigDB via msigdbr (Hallmark ‘H’, curated ‘C2’ and Gene Ontology ‘C5’ collections); sets with &amp;lt;15 or &amp;gt;500 genes were discarded. Enrichment analysis was performed with fgsea (10,000 permutations, default weighting), returning normalized enrichment scores, nominal &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and FDR-adjusted &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; values (Benjamini–Hochberg). Only pathways with an FDR &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 were considered significant and are displayed in the figures. Bar plots of normalized enrichment scores and volcano plots were generated in ggplot2 and EnhancedVolcano, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec38"&gt;Promethion metabolic cages&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were individually housed in Promethion metabolic cages (Sable Systems International) for comprehensive metabolic phenotyping. Before data collection, animals underwent a 24 h acclimation period within the cages to minimize stress and ensure steady-state measurements. Following acclimation, continuous monitoring was performed over a desired period under controlled environmental conditions (temperature, humidity and a 12–12h light–dark cycle) as specified by the manufacturer’s guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Promethion system simultaneously recorded oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and energy expenditure, as well as food and water intake and locomotor activity. Calibration of the sensors and verification of system performance were conducted in strict accordance with Sable Systems International’s operating protocols. Data acquisition and subsequent analysis were carried out using the proprietary Promethion analysis software, ensuring that all measurements met the company’s quality control standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec39"&gt;EchoMRI body composition analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body composition was measured using an EchoMRI-100 on conscious mice. Before each session, the instrument was calibrated with manufacturer-provided oil standards. Individual mice were weighed, placed in a ventilated acrylic restraining tube with an internal insert to minimize movement and scanned (standard mode; water stage on–off as indicated in figure legends). Each scan yielded fat mass, lean mass, free water and total water; values were exported directly from the EchoMRI software for downstream analysis. Restraining tubes were disinfected between animals with 70% ethanol or facility-approved disinfectant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec40"&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DAB staining quantification&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-resolution SVS images of HDAB-stained tissue sections were imported into QuPath (v.0.5.1)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 80" title="Bankhead, P. et al.

Detections were then generated on the average channel image using the custom-trained CellPose-based model using the CellPose plugin for QuPath (v.9.0) (&lt;a href="https://github.com/BIOP/qupath-extension-cellpose"&gt;https://github.com/BIOP/qupath-extension-cellpose&lt;/a&gt;). The detections and tissue outline were exported as an object GeoJSON and imported to the original HDAB-stained image. Detection measurements were generated with QuPath’s built-in Add Intensity Features with the following settings: pixel size, 0.5 µm; region, region of interest; tile diameter, 0; channels, haematoxylin, DAB; basic features, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median. Nuclei were then classified as positive or negative for DAB staining using the mean DAB signal at a threshold of 0.117. A pixel thresholder was used to measure the area covered by DAB staining. A training image generated from an equal number and size of random rectangles from each image was used for parameter setting. QuPath’s Create Thresholder was used with the following settings: resolution, very high (1.01 µm per pixel); channel, DAB; prefilter, Gaussian; smoothing sigma, 1; threshold, 0.25. The measure option was then run on the tissue outline to quantify the area of the tissue covered by DAB staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec41"&gt;Statistics and data reproducibility&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data are presented as means ± s.d. for technical replicates or means ± s.e.m. for biological replicates, as indicated in figure legends. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, v.10.4.1) unless otherwise noted. Comparisons between two groups were conducted using unpaired, two-tailed Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests. For comparisons involving more than two groups, one-way or two-way ANOVA with post hoc multiple-comparison corrections (Tukey’s or Sidak’s test, as appropriate) were applied. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were compared using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test, with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons when indicated. Data distribution was assumed to be normal. Statistical significance was defined as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, with significance levels represented as *&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, **&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01, ***&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 and ****&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001. The statistical tests used for each dataset are specified in the corresponding figure legends when deviating from the above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications. All data were included in the analyses. In rare cases for which data were excluded, exclusion occurred because of animal health concerns (for example, sickness or tissue necrosis) or based on statistical outlier identification using standard outlier exclusion tests. Investigators were blinded to outcome assessment but not to experimental allocation during data collection. All experiments were independently repeated as described in the figure legends, and similar results were obtained, confirming reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec42"&gt;Declaration of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the preparation of this work, the author(s) used OpenAI’s ChatGPT to review grammar, spelling and refine text style.

As a neurologist who sees the devastating consequences daily, it is evident to me that  many strokes need never have happened. Strokes  are the final event in a long, silent process—one that we now have the tools to detect, slow down, and often prevent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Overlooked risk factor&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked contributors to stroke risk lies not in the brain, but in the neck. The carotid arteries, which carry blood to the brain, can gradually narrow due to the build-up of fatty plaques. This process is often completely symptom-free. Yet when a plaque ruptures or a clot forms, blood flow to the brain can suddenly stop, leading to irreversible paralysis, loss of speech, or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an important international study, the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2508800" target="_self"&gt;CREST-2 trial&lt;/a&gt;, offered new clarity on how we can better protect people at risk. The study followed more than 2,400 individuals with severe but symptom-free carotid narrowing. All participants received the best possible medical therapy—including strict control of blood pressure, cholesterol, and other vascular risks. However, the findings showed something crucial: those who also underwent carotid stenting had nearly half the risk of stroke or early death over four years compared with those treated with medicines alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that every individual with carotid disease requires an intervention. What it does reinforce, however, is that early identification of severe carotid narrowing provides an opportunity to offer additional protection to those who truly need it. Timely diagnosis makes the difference between silent risk and preventable tragedy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Tools available&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the simplest tools available to us is the carotid Doppler ultrasound. This non-invasive test uses sound waves—without any radiation—to assess plaque build-up and measure how much the artery has narrowed. It is quick, painless, widely available, and remarkably informative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is not recommended indiscriminately for everyone, it can be immensely useful for individuals with multiple stroke risk factors. These include high blood pressure, diabetes, elevated cholesterol levels, smoking, heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or a strong family history of vascular events. For adults above 50–55 with such risks, adding a carotid Doppler scan to an annual health check can help unearth silent but dangerous blockages long before they cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Focusing on the basics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, no scan replaces the basics. The most effective protection against stroke continues to be disciplined control of blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes; quitting smoking; regular physical activity; and maintaining a healthy body weight. These &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/doctors-stress-need-for-healthier-lifestyles-regular-check-ups-to-prevent-strokes-in-young-adults/article68805892.ece" target="_self"&gt;lifestyle foundations&lt;/a&gt; remain our strongest defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we must &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/understanding-the-fast-rule-how-to-spot-a-stroke-in-seconds/article70215513.ece" target="_self"&gt;remember the signs&lt;/a&gt; that need urgent medical attention. Sudden weakness, facial drooping, slurred speech, vision loss, or sudden imbalance should &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; be treated as a medical emergency. These brief, transient episodes—often called warning strokes—may be the first indication of significant carotid disease and represent a narrow window to prevent something far more catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we work toward strengthening &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/india-records-18-lakh-new-brain-stroke-cases-every-year-nationwide-campaign-launched/article69834815.ece" target="_self"&gt;India’s stroke-preparedness ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, encouraging proactive risk assessment must be a key priority. A simple neck artery scan, guided by the individual’s risk profile, can be the difference between identifying a silent threat early and discovering it only after disability strikes. Stroke prevention is not only possible—it is within reach, if we act n time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Dr. Vikram Huded is senior consultant, director, and clinical lead, interventional neurology programme, Narayana Health, Bengaluru. vikram.huded.dr@narayanahealth.org)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="update-publish-time article-published-time-end"&gt;&lt;p class="publish-time-new"&gt; Published &lt;span&gt;- December 09, 2025 03:46 pm IST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-block d-sm-none "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hindu</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 10:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>尖端的Tourette综合征治疗帮助女性重拾日常生活- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/news/health-now/after-years-of-tourette-syndrome-battles-woman-finds-new-beginning-with-experimental-procedure/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyContent"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Neurology Department at Allegheny General Hospital’s Hemlock Building, Abigail Bailey’s body folded forward in her chair.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her muscles tightened as if someone had forced the air from her lungs.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her nose burned, her chest hitched and she gripped the chair’s armrests to keep from collapsing.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail’s younger sister reached out and gently brushed a section of hair from her face.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I felt it kick in,” Abigail said. It was her physical reaction to her brain wirelessly connecting to the laptop sitting on the examination bed next to her Friday.

&lt;p&gt;Abigail, 24, of Hookstown in Beaver County, has lived and struggled with Tourette syndrome for more than two decades. But it wasn’t until last year — when a bladder infection led to sepsis and triggered a spike in painful motor and vocal tics — that she chose to pursue an experimental treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, she underwent a two-part deep-brain stimulation procedure. Surgeons implanted a device that delivers electrical impulses to targeted areas of the brain to treat motor disorders.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was like, ‘It’s time. I don’t even care what it takes. I just want my life back. I want to be happy,’” Abigail said, remembering the constant physical pain her uncontrolled tics put her through.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="graybox"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="hidden-xs"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, eight months later, she is working full-time, living independently and preparing for her 2026 wedding.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spirits were high Friday as Abigail, joined by her sister Emily Bailey and her mother Colleen Bailey, visited the Allegheny Health Network hospital in Pittsburgh’s North Side. It was a routine visit to recalibrate the electrodes in her brain to help minimize the involuntary movements associated with Tourette syndrome.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurosurgical Physician Assistant Amanda Webb pointed to the different parts of Abigail’s brain they were targeting on the laptop’s screen. Everyone in the room was struck by the technology and shared memories of times when Abigail’s tics were less controlled.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the nature of their visit, everyone in the hospital room laughed and told stories to the doctors and staff.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If anybody in the world should’ve had Tourette, it was Abby — because she handled it like a pro,” said Colleen.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘Not curable’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail, who grew up on a farm in Hookstown, was 3 years old when her parents began to notice symptoms of Tourette syndrome.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourette’s is a neurological disorder marked by sudden, repetitive, uncontrollable movements and sounds, with symptoms typically beginning between ages 5 and 10, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition can become dangerous when tics lead to accidental self-injury.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Abigail’s case, she has broken several fingers and even her ribs during severe tic episodes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn’t realize until middle school how disruptive her tics had become. By high school, she was attending a modified schooling program.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her tics became an issue when she distracted her classmates and interrupted lessons.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were points in her life when she was younger, when she was like a fish flopping on the ground,” Colleen said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I started noticing the older I got the … worse it was getting,” Abigail said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She began to feel she was reverting back to childhood as she lost control of her body.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, Abigail spent a week each year at a camp for people with Tourette’s and their families. There, she made friends with other kids who shared her condition and heard stories of the severe bullying many of them faced.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was eye opening,” said Emily, her sister.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Abigail said she never faced bullying or cruelty from other students, many of her teachers didn’t understand her condition.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Abigail entered elementary school, Colleen met with the school board to discuss Tourette’s. She distributed handmade guidebooks explaining the condition and how to respond to it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did everything we could in order to learn about Tourette’s, because it was devastating for us to find out. But you know, your daughter has something that’s not curable, and as a mom, you want to solve everything, because that’s your job, and you can’t solve it. So you have to learn everything about it,” Colleen said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail graduated from Eastern Gateway Community College with a degree in social work, before attending Robert Morris University, in pursuit of a degree in health services administration.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘Everything pretty much revolved around my tics’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Abigail called her mother. She was extremely sick and scared.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She said, ‘Mom, I can’t get out of bed. I can’t do anything. I need your help,’ ” said Colleen, teary-eyed in the waiting room of the neurologist, before the Friday check-in appointment. “I didn’t know she had gotten that bad again. It was so bad she couldn’t do anything. It was horrible.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time she became ill, Abigail was living on her own and working as a case manager at a pharmaceutical company, helping people with chronic illnesses access care and develop treatment plans.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While hospitalized with sepsis, Abigail’s tics worsened drastically. She was placed on multiple different medications that left her feeling unlike herself.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She barely remembers that month,” Colleen said.

&lt;p class="caption" align="left"&gt;Abigail Bailey (center) at Allegheny General Hospital with Physician Assistant Amanda Webb (right) and Neuroscience Institute Chair and Surgeon Dr. Donald Whiting. (Louis B. Ruediger | Triblive )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="graybox"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="hidden-xs"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Three months later, Dr. Donald Whiting performed two surgeries — one to place the electrodes in her brain and a second to connect them to a pacemaker or “battery” inside Abigail’s chest.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the brain, there’s circuits that connect to different structures in the brain that help modulate that activity and make sure that everything is moving smoothly … so by putting an electrode into one of those two areas and adjusting the electricity, we regulate that relay center,” said Whiting, chair of Allegheny Health Network’s Neuroscience Institute.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail is one of only a handful of patients Whiting has performed deep-brain stimulation surgery on for Tourette’s. The Bailey family came across Whiting while researching the treatment when Abigail was still in high school, but it wasn’t until she got sick that they decided to go through with it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was so scared, as a high schooler, of somebody operating on her brain,” Colleen said. “We researched Dr. Whiting, and we knew he was the best in the field. He’d been doing it for 20 years.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the device is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, insurance companies don’t always approve it because it is still considered experimental for Tourette syndrome, Whiting said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Abigail’s insurance covered the procedure. With the machine’s help, which runs 24 hours a day, she is able to live her life again.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is more personal, but the coolest thing in this job is to really be able to make a difference in people’s lives, and particularly young people like her. This is really just amazing that she’s now going to have a life, to get married and live in a house, get a job.” Whiting said. “To me, that’s just what it’s all about.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail has been engaged to her high school sweetheart, Shane Smith, since June 2024. In August&lt;ins&gt; 2025&lt;/ins&gt;, she started a new job as a patient service representative for Heritage Valley Health System. Planning for the 2026 wedding is well underway.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything pretty much revolved around my tics,” Abigail said. “You just have to get through it. … There’s life at the end of the tunnel, we (people with Tourette’s) just have to make it there.”

&lt;/p&gt;

                Over 100 million people in the United States are estimated to have allergies each year – be they seasonal, topical, or food-related.

   &lt;p&gt;More than 100 million people in the U.S. have some allergy each year. That's about every 1 in 3 adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For many, the fix is a bandaid: over-the-counter allergy medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there's another treatment that works to lessen these reactions rather than just manage people's symptoms, allergy shots. The treatment has been around for over a century and is still popular today. Patients have to take the shots for a few years, and it's the closest thing science has to a cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Host &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/1082526815/regina-g-barber" target="_blank"&gt;Regina G.

That’s how you lose fat, that’s how you stay full (and) lean.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of regular foods with low calories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adi broke down her food list into three distinct groups. The first included foods that are “high-volume, low-calorie, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/nutritionist-says-these-15-high-fiber-fruits-vegetables-and-lentils-can-help-control-hunger-and-weight-loss-naturally-101764586193271.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="high-fibre"&gt;high-fibre&lt;/a&gt;” and can keep us feeling full without significantly increasing the calorie count and derailing the weight-loss journey. Such foods include the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Egg whites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yoghurt (0-2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watermelon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All leafy greens (spinach, arugula, lettuce)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydrating veggies (cucumber, tomato, zucchini)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cruciferous veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carrots (smack them raw — also great for your teeth)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pumpkin/squash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone broth (big volume, almost no calories)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pickles (super filling, almost zero calories)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air-popped popcorn (3 cups = nothing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of lean proteins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins are the building blocks of our body and are absolutely essential for muscle growth. As such, lean proteins are an important part of the diet to stay healthy, even as we cut weight. Adi’s proteins of choice are listed as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;White fish (cod, tilapia)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shrimp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chicken breast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turkey breast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cottage cheese (0-2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edamame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of carbohydrates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While controlling the intake of carbohydrates is essential for hitting the weight loss target, the energy-rich food group is also necessary for vital functions.

'Things such as hugging people, going outside, taking a hot shower and being around people are all tasks Cailin [could not] partake in.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joyce was forced to miss many of the joyful early days of college life, including living in the dorms, going to OSU football games, and attending classes as well as being unable to pursue her passion for dance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus is one of the most common in the world, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Cailin Joyce, 19, was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder due to the Epstein-Barr virus at the beginning of the school year and the dancer was left bed-ridden before passing on Saturday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After spending a significant amount of time in hospital with her mother, Terese seen on the left and Joyce's father Sean on the right, Joyce's condition 'took a sudden turn for the worse'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The young teen was an active member in her parish's youth ministry program and the Ohio State Club Dance Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most who contract the virus show no symptoms, which include fatigue, fever, inflammation of the liver and throat, rash, swollen lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many who do present symptoms, which typically appear as teens or adults, recover in around two to four weeks. Currently, there is no specific treatment for EBV and no vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Joyce, her immune system became compromised and her organs suffered 'extreme inflammation resulting in her body retaining a ton of fluid,' the GoFundMe said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But her condition only worsened and she succumbed to the illness after a months-long fight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cailin was a bright, joyful, faith-filled young woman whose presence touched so many. She will be remembered by the JOY she brought to everyone she met. She lit up every room she walked in,' the fundraiser said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The young teen was an active member in her parish's youth ministry program and the Ohio State Club Dance Team, which celebrated third place in the NCA &amp;amp; NDA Collegiate Cheer and Dance Championship in April. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her teammates wrote on &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR-IZUOjgHe/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram &lt;/a&gt;that Joyce 'embodied everything that our team represented.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She was kind, humble, determined, loyal and oh so funny.

Because that’s just who you were. You were everything and more.

You have truly made my life so full with all of our unforgettable memories and countless hours spent laughing together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You made life so much sweeter, and I am forever grateful to be able to know you and to be known by you.

Every year, like clockwork, we see a spike in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-with-40-years-of-experience-shares-5-early-warning-signs-of-sudden-heart-attacks-starts-in-the-centre-101765017532465.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart attacks"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, around Christmas and New Year's. In fact, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/christmas" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Christmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; Eve is the highest risk day of the year. Well, why does this happen?”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Behaviour and holiday habits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to Dr London, drastic changes in eating and drinking habits during the holidays can put extra strain on the heart, increasing the risk of heart attacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He explains, “First is our behaviour. We drink too much, we eat too much, and we tend to move less around the holidays.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The holiday season also brings a surge of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/stress" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="stress"&gt;stress &lt;/a&gt;- from financial pressures to social obligations and packed schedules - all of which can quietly elevate the risk of heart attacks. Dr London highlights, “Next is stress - emotional stress, financial stress, the increased pace of the holidays, increased obligations.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cold weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The heart surgeon explains that cold weather causes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-explains-why-your-heart-attack-risk-doubles-at-night-this-is-when-blood-vessels-tighten-blood-pressure-101757039051096.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood vessels"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; to constrict, reducing blood flow, thereby raising the risk of heart attacks. He explains, “Cold weather causes vasoconstriction which increases the risk of plaque rupture and potential heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Delay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Amid the celebrations and holiday cheer, people often ignore their body’s warning signs, brushing off symptoms and delaying medical attention - and sometimes that can lead to serious complications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dr London puts it as, “And finally, is delay. I don't feel good but I'll wait till after holiday dinner to get checked out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to prevent holiday heart attacks?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr London outlines four precautionary measures you can adopt to prevent unnecessary complications during the holidays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Movement is medicine: Maintain or increase your activity level. Dr London recommends getting out and exercising every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Don’t skip your meds: Set an alarm on your phone as a reminder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prioritise sleep and mindfulness: Taking care of yourself during this stressful time is important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Don’t ignore symptoms: If you feel like something is off, don’t ignore it.

							&lt;p&gt;Strength doesn’t always announce itself loudly. Sometimes it shows up in the small, thoughtful ways people speak to us when we need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I think about people with genuinely strong personalities, I’m reminded of how gentle they often are in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They use language that grounds people instead of shaking them, and psychology consistently shows that supportive communication is one of the biggest markers of emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’ve noticed over the years, both in my own relationships and while diving into the research around behavior and communication, is that strong personalities tend to gravitate toward certain phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t catchphrases or motivational slogans. They’re simple sentences that make others feel understood, valued, and capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, I want to share seven of those phrases with you. They’re small, but trust me, they carry weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) “I see why you’d feel that way.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s something incredibly calming about feeling understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase offers instant validation without taking sides, which is one of the most psychologically grounding things you can do for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities know that people aren’t usually asking to be fixed. They’re asking to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentence does exactly that because it shows that you listened long enough to recognize the emotional logic behind what someone is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up a version of this habit while traveling through Japan in my twenties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversations there emphasized harmony and understanding, and people took their time acknowledging each other’s feelings before offering any kind of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now, whenever I use this phrase, I can almost feel that same &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/dna-7-daily-habits-of-people-who-stay-calm-no-matter-what-life-throws-at-them/"&gt;sense of calm&lt;/a&gt; passing through the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validation isn’t agreement. It’s respect. Strong personalities understand that difference, and that’s why they use this phrase so naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) “Tell me more.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those phrases that immediately shifts the entire direction of a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It tells the other person that you’re not planning your rebuttal, you’re not jumping to conclusions, and you’re not assuming you already know where the story is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone says, “Tell me more,” they’re signaling curiosity instead of judgment. Curiosity lowers walls. Judgment builds them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with strong personalities choose curiosity because they aren’t threatened by different perspectives, and they aren’t in a rush to control the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this phrase often when I’m trying to understand someone’s thought process, especially when I’m interviewing people or digging into a psychological concept I’m writing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeper you go into someone’s experience, the more clarity you get about what they actually need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/nat-people-who-have-a-rare-combination-of-high-intelligence-and-deep-intuition-usually-display-these-8-behaviors/"&gt;intuitively make space&lt;/a&gt; for that clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple phrase that makes people feel safe opening up. And in my experience, it’s one of the most generous ones you can offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) “You’re not alone in this.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people aren’t overwhelmed because they don’t have solutions. They’re overwhelmed because they think they’re carrying something alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/social-isolation-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; this “perceived social isolation,” and it’s powerful enough to make even ordinary challenges feel impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities tend to be the first to interrupt that belief. They know how heavy life can feel when you convince yourself you’re on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they say the words we don’t realize we’re desperate to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a close friend of mine was going through a brutal breakup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have anything insightful or wise to say at that moment, but I remember telling him, “You’re not alone in this. I’m here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t offering a solution. I was &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-8-phrases-emotionally-intelligent-people-use-when-they-notice-someone-is-quietly-struggling/"&gt;offering presence&lt;/a&gt;. And sometimes, presence is the very thing that lifts someone back onto their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase uplifts because it reminds us that carrying something together changes the weight of it. Strong people know that, and they offer their companionship freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) “You’ve handled tough things before.”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often forget their own resilience. When stress hits, memory gets short, and we act like every challenge is the first one we’ve ever faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase gently reconnects someone to their own strength by pointing them back to their previous victories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In psychology, this ties into a concept called &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-self-efficacy-2795954" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;self-efficacy&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially your belief in your ability to handle life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities speak to that belief directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They remind people of what they’ve already survived, knowing it will give them confidence to face what’s in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this one from a mentor early in my writing career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I’d panic about a deadline, he’d say, “This isn’t your first climb.” For whatever reason, those words always centered me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-i-held-onto-resentment-for-years-then-i-learned-these-8-steps-to-truly-let-go/"&gt;shifted my focus from fear&lt;/a&gt; to capability, and I’ve used a version of that phrase in countless conversations since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with strong personalities know that sometimes the most uplifting thing you can do is help someone remember who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this phrase does exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) “It’s okay to take your time.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If modern life had a soundtrack, it would be a constant ticking clock. We’re always rushing, always &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-5-things-i-stopped-doing-that-made-me-happier-in-15-days-than-id-been-in-years/"&gt;comparing our timelines&lt;/a&gt;, always feeling like we’re behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities break that pattern for other people by reminding them that there’s no universal schedule for growth or healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase permits people to slow down without feeling guilty. It creates space where pressure used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is often the one thing someone needs to breathe again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m out shooting photos, I catch myself rushing more than I should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But funny enough, the best images I’ve ever taken came from slowing down and letting the moment settle. Life works the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong people understand that not everything needs to be solved immediately, and not every chapter needs to be hurried through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By saying, “It’s okay to take your time,” they offer people a kind of emotional permission many of us rarely give ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hearing it can feel like someone loosening a knot in your chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) “What do you need right now?”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of assuming the answer or diving into advice mode, people with strong personalities go straight to the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ask the person what they actually want or need in that moment. It seems obvious, but most of us forget to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/k-9-phrases-boomers-use-that-younger-generations-secretly-find-comforting/"&gt;encourages clarity&lt;/a&gt;, autonomy, and emotional honesty. It hands the power back to the person who might be feeling powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And psychologically, it transforms the dynamic from “I know what’s best” to “You know what’s best, and I’m here to support that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to a reader recently who said this question changed the way she leaned on her friends during &lt;a href="https://www.helpguide.org/mental-health/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For weeks, she didn’t know how to articulate what she needed until someone asked her directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when he did, the answer came easily. She needed rest. She needed quiet. She needed permission to step back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities help people uncover that truth instead of assuming it. This phrase is an invitation to self-awareness, and that alone can be deeply uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) “I believe in you.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase is simple, but it’s a psychological powerhouse. Humans tend to rise to the level of the expectations the people around them hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone with a strong personality says they believe in you, something inside you stands a little taller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is tied to the &lt;a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/pygmalion-effect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pygmalion effect&lt;/a&gt;, which shows that positive expectations from others can actually improve someone’s performance and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t magic. It’s social psychology. And it works more often than you’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time an editor trusted me with a big feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think I was ready, but he did, and I leaned into his belief until it became my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities use this phrase when it matters, not as empty flattery but as a &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/c-lc-my-evenings-felt-aimless-and-restless-but-these-7-rituals-gave-me-structure-and-calm/"&gt;genuine reflection&lt;/a&gt; of what they see in someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often forget their strengths. A phrase like this can return them instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities aren’t defined by volume, intensity, or force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re defined by the way they communicate calm, confidence, and compassion to the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seven phrases uplift because they validate, reassure, and empower. They make people feel capable. They make people feel accompanied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they make people feel human in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can develop this type of strength. It starts with being intentional about the words we choose and the presence we bring into every conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

"Because we don't know where this infection originated, it's important that everyone in the Bingham school community be aware of symptoms and the possibility they were exposed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department warned that symptoms can usually appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include high fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, followed by a rash. So they advise anyone associated with Bingham High School who develops symptoms to contact their health care provider or clinic before arriving so the facility can provide instructions about how to seek care without exposing other people to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best form of protection against measles is vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said two doses of the MMR vaccine can prevent more than 97% of measles infections. It added that vaccinated people who do get measles tend to have milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unvaccinated people — including children too young to be vaccinated — are more likely to experience severe complications," the department noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

His research focuses on how metabolism, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-hormones-keep-an-hourly-rhythm-shaping-mood-and-energy/"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt;, and stress inside cells shape aging and disease across different tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, the ketogenic diet, a very low carbohydrate, high fat way of eating, is designed to push the body away from sugar and toward fat as its main energy source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The keto diet is a very low-carbohydrate, high fat way of eating that shifts the body’s primary energy source from carbohydrates to fat,” explained Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When carb intake stays low enough, the liver produces ketones, small fuel molecules made from fat that can power the brain and other organs when glucose is scarce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carefully planned ketogenic programs are a long standing therapy for drug resistant epilepsy, and a pediatric hospital keto &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27373-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;clinic&lt;/a&gt; has reported large seizure reductions in many children without major growth problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-aging-and-keto-diets"&gt;Studying aging and keto diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one mouse &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124725007971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, male animals fed a keto diet for several weeks showed a spike in markers of cellular aging called senescence, a state where stressed cells stop dividing but stay alive and inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These senescent cells piled up in the heart and kidney, along with higher levels of inflammatory molecules in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female mice on the same diet did not show the same surge in senescent cells or inflammatory signals over that time window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their heart and kidney tissue stayed closer to normal, even though their blood ketone levels confirmed they were in ketosis just like the males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The male mice also showed strong signs of oxidative stress, an overload of reactive oxygen containing molecules that chip away at fats, proteins, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-link-autism-to-neanderthal-dna-genetic-variants-found-in-modern-humans/"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage markers such as oxidized lipids and modified proteins climbed in male organs on keto, while female tissues again remained largely unchanged under the same feeding plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older female mice with naturally lower estrogen levels began to look more like the males when they were placed on a ketogenic diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They developed more senescent cells and oxidative damage, linking the protection seen in younger females to hormone status rather than sex alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hormones-oxidative-stress-and-aging-cells"&gt;Hormones, oxidative stress, and aging cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test that idea directly, the team treated some male mice with estrogen, a major female sex hormone that also influences metabolism and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those males no longer showed the keto driven rise in senescent cells or oxidative damage, suggesting that estrogen was actively buffering their tissues against stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protective role fits with broader research showing that estrogen can tune up the cell’s own defense systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, estrogen replacement &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448598/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to switch on antioxidant and longevity related genes and to lower several measures of oxidative stress, supporting the idea that hormone status changes how tissues weather metabolic strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also tried a different route, giving male mice classic antioxidants, compounds that neutralize reactive oxygen molecules before they harm cell structures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agents such as N-acetylcysteine, alpha lipoic acid, vitamin C, and a drug that mimics the antioxidant enzyme MnSOD, all cut back the buildup of senescent cells and oxidative damage in keto fed males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those antioxidant treatments also brought inflammatory blood markers down toward normal in the male mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the hormone and antioxidant experiments suggest that the diet itself creates extra oxidative pressure, but hormones and chemical defenses can either blunt or amplify the impact on aging cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keto-in-real-people-risks-and-uses"&gt;Keto in real people, risks and uses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal work like this does not translate directly to humans, which the researchers themselves stressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we can gain insight into metabolic processes through studies defining effects of a keto diet in mice, we do not yet extrapolate those findings in humans,” said Jason Ng, MD, BA, who teaches endocrinology and metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the &lt;a href="https://dom.pitt.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, human data already show that keto style patterns are not neutral for the heart and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a randomized feeding &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33801247/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, healthy young women following a ketogenic low carbohydrate high fat diet developed very high LDL cholesterol levels compared with when they ate a more conventional non keto diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A broad cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146280624000410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; concludes that low carbohydrate patterns can bring quick drops in weight, blood pressure, and blood sugar, yet they do not outperform other eating styles for long term cardiovascular outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That review also flags safety questions, including nutrient gaps, kidney strain, and possible effects on arterial plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate work in male mice found that long periods of keto feeding led to fat buildup in the liver and worse glucose control, changes that eased after switching back to standard chow in one &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1290540/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mixed findings underline that keto is a strong &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-extracts-may-help-treat-metabolic-syndrome/"&gt;metabolic &lt;/a&gt;tool, not a harmless shortcut, and responses can vary across bodies and over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-lessons-from-keto-diets"&gt;Aging lessons from keto diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new mouse work suggests that deep carb restriction might speed the accumulation of senescent cells in some tissues, at least in male animals with typical hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of cellular aging is linked in other research to stiffer hearts, weaker kidneys, and chronic low grade inflammation as organisms grow older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, ketogenic therapy remains a vital option for some people with severe epilepsy when other drugs fail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some cases, particularly for specific medical conditions like epilepsy, a medically supervised keto or modified low carb approach can be beneficial,” said Routhenstein, who emphasized the need for professional guidance when such a restrictive diet is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people drawn to keto mainly for weight loss or short term glucose control, the picture is more unsettled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings add sex and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-tricks-the-immune-system-with-the-help-of-hormone-scg2/"&gt;hormone&lt;/a&gt; status to a growing list of factors that likely shape who does well, who runs into trouble, and how long such a diet should reasonably continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of this research, one message stands out clearly: very low carbohydrate, very high fat diets act as powerful metabolic stress tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone considering them as a lifestyle choice, rather than a time limited medical therapy, needs careful medical supervision, regular lab checks, and an honest look at whether less extreme changes could meet their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00797-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124725007971%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Arizona are sounding the alarm on how changing weather patterns are affecting the transmission of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-happening"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://news.azpm.org/p/azpmnews/2025/10/31/227085-arizona-researchers-track-how-climate-change-is-fueling-mosquito-activity-and-disease-risk/" target="_blank"&gt;AZPM&lt;/a&gt;, NPR's Southern Arizona affiliate, scientists are concerned about the relationship between warming global temperatures and &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/unexpected-mosquito-surge-sacramento/" target="_blank"&gt;mosquito-transmitted diseases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The region has seen two confirmed human cases of &lt;a href="https://www.pima.gov/2720/Newsroom?contentId=0e3f1793-94e6-4ffe-bc70-7f7527646ee7" target="_blank"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt; in 2025&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diseases like West Nile virus are known as "&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;vector-borne diseases&lt;/a&gt;," a class of diseases that infect humans through the bites of arthropods like fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-88403d5a29392b7611b66112dea3a6fe theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-88403d5a29392b7611b66112dea3a6fe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-69b34f23595ebfc51d398c4fbbe33302 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-69b34f23595ebfc51d398c4fbbe33302"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-e37eb46fcd4c5bc65ba5b2cb3d446bc8 theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-e37eb46fcd4c5bc65ba5b2cb3d446bc8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-30e55e7a457a6cdd5a0231f0377c46b6 theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-30e55e7a457a6cdd5a0231f0377c46b6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-3d876f2e81d079827d6ae36eb06c32d6 theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-3d876f2e81d079827d6ae36eb06c32d6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes can not only infect humans, but they can also pick up the disease of an already infected human with their bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-2a6a67f22e63f64cf05d197c641550a3 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-2a6a67f22e63f64cf05d197c641550a3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-the-relationship-between-a-warmer-planet-and-vector-borne-illnesses-concerning"&gt;Why is the relationship between a warmer planet and vector-borne illnesses concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the American Southwest, &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/explore-critical-climate-issues/" target="_blank"&gt;rising temperatures&lt;/a&gt; mean that summer heat waves are more extreme than ever, which speeds up the mosquito lifecycle, expands their reach and longevity, and increases their numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-4261581203" data-theco-trackid="446882" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="theco-3120c6e45430773e1d343f19b2eaec58 theco-embedded-video" id="theco-3120c6e45430773e1d343f19b2eaec58"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, more intense monsoon seasons are ideal for mosquito breeding, as they need to lay their eggs in water. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/quinx-mosquito-spread-west-nile-virus/" target="_blank"&gt;The bug's ability to adapt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/mosquitoes-adapting-rising-temperatures/" target="_blank"&gt;changing climate conditions&lt;/a&gt; also concerns scientists, as it makes prevention methods a more temporary solution, with the need to update practices over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-62417e8a7070ca2edd1507faec803684 theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-62417e8a7070ca2edd1507faec803684"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The new places that become better for mosquitoes outweigh the places that are currently experiencing and might experience less due to high temperatures," explained Heidi Brown, an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/psr/yearinreview2021" target="_blank"&gt;In 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Pima County in Arizona saw over 100 cases of West Nile virus during a year littered with particularly hot weather and a violent monsoon season. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As global temperatures rise and extreme weather becomes stronger, longer, and more frequent &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/steroids-extreme-weather-climate-change-storms/" target="_blank"&gt;as a result&lt;/a&gt;, the region will likely see more years of elevated case counts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"It's one of the things that's fascinating to me as a scientist," Brown said. "These diseases shouldn't exist, right? It just seems completely improbable, and yet it's not. It's a very big problem globally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-d7a8ea6b19b30b88ab32fc0b487a8408 theco-ad-after-12th-p" id="theco-d7a8ea6b19b30b88ab32fc0b487a8408"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-being-done-to-mitigate-disease-transmission-by-mosquitoes"&gt;What's being done to mitigate disease transmission by mosquitoes?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Southern Arizona, one of the methods to manage vector-borne diseases is a more indirect approach that addresses other concerns in the area. Municipalities are experimenting with &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/red-oak-rain-garden-university-illinois/" target="_blank"&gt;green stormwater infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; to recycle much-needed water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The method not only benefits the water supply but also helps reduce the amount of standing water that makes for ideal mosquito breeding conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The reason that we care about green stormwater infrastructure is because adding nature back into the urban environment provides all of these benefits in the urban environment that we really need, like cooling, shade, air quality improvement," said Blue Baldwin, program manager for the City of Tucson's climate action initiative Storm to Shade, per AZPM.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend the birth dose only for the infants of women who test positive for hepatitis B or whose infection status is unknown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The panel voted that women whose blood tests show they aren’t infected with hepatitis B should discuss the issue with their doctors. The acting CDC director, Jim O’Neill, MA, has not yet announced whether the agency will adopt the recommendations as official policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hospitals, regional health alliances rejecting ACIP recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago will continue to recommend hepatitis B vaccines to newborns within 24 hours of delivery – when immunization will protect the largest proportion of infants – as recommended by the Chicago and Illinois health departments, said Larry K. Kociolek, MD, MSCI, vice president of system preparedness, prevention, and response and a pediatric infectious diseases attending physician.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The pediatric vaccine schedule currently adopted in the US is based on decades of research, extensive real-world experience, and vetting by well-trained and unbiased medical and public health experts,” Kociolek told CIDRAP News.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recommendations from the ACIP “were made without any new research suggesting that the current vaccine schedule is flawed in terms of its safety or effectiveness,” Kociolek said. “We will continue to endorse the pediatric vaccine schedule currently in place.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ACIP’s members were handpicked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist. Many of the new members parrot Kennedy’s false claims that vaccines aren’t adequately tested for safety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ACIP’s decision to vaccinate only babies deemed to be at “high risk” for hepatitis B flies in the face of evidence, said Ravi Jhaveri, MD, head of infectious diseases at Lurie Children’s Hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new recommendation “assumes that we can accurately predict who has infection and who will be exposed in the future; we cannot,” said Jhaveri, who noted that previous recommendations to target hepatitis B vaccines toward babies of infected moms failed to lower infection rates. “This is the lesson we learned prior to starting birth dose. The fact that this committee ignores our prior experience proves their agenda has nothing to do with the evidence.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other clinicians are taking a similar approach. The hepatitis B vaccine is “safe, exceptionally effective, and one of the great success stories in modern public health,” said Stephen Patrick, MD, MPH, MS, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital of Atlanta, who said he will not change how he practices because of the ACIP vote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For the first time in my career, I am deeply concerned that I cannot fully rely on the CDC’s recommendations,” Patrick said. “My duty is to my patients, and I will continue to lean on my training and the best available evidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before the CDC recommended a universal birth dose, about 30,000 children were infected every year, he said. About 90% of infants infected at birth develop chronic hepatitis B. About 25% of children with chronic infections die prematurely from liver cancer or cirrhosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In defiance of Kennedy and the agency he is remaking in his image, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/12/west-coast-health-experts-reject-rfk-jr-panel-say-hepatitis-b-vaccines-at-birth-should-continue.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;West Coast Health Alliance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-01-01_statement_northeast_public_health_collaborative.htm%23:~:text=ALBANY%2C%20N.Y.%20(December%201%2C%202025)%20%E2%80%93%20%22The,that%20all%20newborns%20receive%20a%20hepatitis%20B"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Northeast Public Health Collaborative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govsforhealth.org/news/govs-acip-hepb-2/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Governors Public Health Alliance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; also rejected the ACIP’s proposal. The regional health care alliances were formed in recent months, largely in states led by Democratic governors, to provide an alternative to the CDC, which has lost the confidence of doctors across the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaming up with parents to protect children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Manisha Juthani, MD, an infectious disease physician and commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Public Health, said her state has no plans to change its vaccination policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We do not anticipate changing our policy,” Juthani said today at a press conference of public health leaders. “If anything, we are more concerned about how to communicate and clarify the noise from the facts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Juthani said all vaccines are given only after informed consent from parents or guardian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No vaccine is put into the into a child without the consent of the parent,” Juthani said. “We are going to still encourage providers to have that conversation at birth.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Maryland Department of Health has issued a standing order “to ensure hepatitis B vaccine accessibility to all children and infants in the state,” said Michelle Taylor, MD, DrPH, MPS, commissioner of the Baltimore City Health Department and incoming chair of the Big Cities Health Coalition, at the press conference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the first time in my career, I am deeply concerned that I cannot fully rely on the CDC’s recommendations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many parents will be confused by ACIP’s recommendation, and pediatricians should be willing to listen to them and provide thoughtful answers, said Lisa Costello, MD, MPH, chair of the AAP’s committee on state government affairs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People “fiercely love their children, and they want to do what's in their best interest,” Costello, a pediatrician and associate professor of general pediatrics at the West Virginia University School of Medicine, said at the press conference. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“As pediatricians, we're on that team with them,” she added. The vaccine discussion is “one that we need to keep having and make sure that we're meeting people where they're at.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurance coverage of vaccines to continue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Private insurance plans will continue to cover the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccines as well, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bcbs.com/about-us/association-news/blue-cross-blue-shield-statement-vaccines"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BlueCross BlueShield Association&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage"&gt;&lt;span&gt;AHIP, formerly America’s Health Insurance Plans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an industry group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AHIP members will cover all vaccines recommended by ACIP as September 1, including updated flu shots and COVID-19 vaccines, with no cost sharing through the end of 2026. BlueCross BlueShield companies will cover all vaccines approved as of January 1, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In August, Kennedy warned health providers not to deviate from the CDC’s vaccine recommendations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“AAP should also be candid with doctors and hospitals that recommendations that diverge from the CDC’s official list are not shielded from liability under the 1986 Vaccine Injury Act,” Kennedy posted on X, the social media platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That statement is misleading, said Dorit Reiss, PhD, a law professor at the University of California San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors could defend themselves from malpractice claims by citing the AAP vaccine schedule as a standard of care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If there are multiple standards in the profession, it is not malpractice as long as you followed one of the accepted approaches,” Reiss said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hepatitis B vaccines are still included in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a program established by Congress nearly 40 years ago, said Richard H. Hughes IV, JD, MPH, who teaches vaccine law at George Washington University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That means that families who believe that their child was injured by a vaccine are still required to first file a complaint with the vaccine court. If the vaccine court rejects their claim, they may sue in civil court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“AAP guidelines form a viable standard of care and there are liability shields under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,” Hughes said. “Therefore, providers should have protections.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If Kennedy wants to remove hepatitis B vaccines from the VICP, the law requires that he go through a lengthy rule-making process, in which proposed changes are published and the public is given time to comment, Reiss said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jhaveri said he is trying to take an optimistic view.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think most people see vaccines as a positive thing, which is why they consistently get their children vaccinated,” Jhaveri said. “I think this will continue because they can see the benefits of vaccines for themselves.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						A southern Iowa school district has canceled classes Tuesday, Dec. 9 and Wednesday, Dec. 10 due to illness. An official with the Moulton-Udell School District, in Appanoose County, told KCCI about 30% of students and staff are out — many with influenza A. "We will use this time to fully sanitize our facilities and provide a needed health reset for our students, staff, and families," the school posted on its Facebook page. Athletic events and other activities are also canceled.Last month, following the state's first flu-related death of the season, KCCI spoke to several medical professionals about how to stay healthy this winter. State Medical Director Dr. Robert Kruse issued a statement urging Iowans to talk with their doctors about getting the flu shot and reminding anyone who is ill — or whose children are ill — to stay home. The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services also recommends that Iowans:Stay home and avoid social gatherings if you or your children are sick.Clean high-touch surfaces in your home frequently with household disinfectants.Practice hand hygiene frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer for at least 20 seconds.Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, or if a tissue is not available, cover them with an upper shirt sleeve, not a hand.Keep children home from daycare or school who have fever, cough, congestion, runny nose, or sore throat, and until they are fever-free for 24 hours without medications that reduce fever.If you or a loved one is sick and needs medical care, contact your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider can offer advice on whether you or your child needs to be evaluated in person, tested for flu or other respiratory diseases, and the best location for care.» Subscribe to KCCI's YouTube page» Download the free KCCI app to get updates on the go: Apple | Google Play

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;U.S. health officials have issued travel advisories for Americans planning trips to certain tropical countries amid outbreaks of an untreatable mosquito-borne disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Friday that it has issued Level 2 &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/cuba" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;travel advisories for Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Guangdong Province in southern China, advising Americans to "practice enhanced precautions" when visiting these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say there are currently no treatments for chikungunya, but the disease is vaccine-preventable, and vaccination is recommended for travelers to affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms of the virus include fever and joint pain, though patients may also experience headache, muscle pain, joint swelling or a rash, according to health officials. Symptoms typically appear three to seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, and most people recover within a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cdc-reports-19th-cruise-ship-norovirus-outbreak-year-affecting-passengers-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC REPORTS 19TH CRUISE SHIP NOROVIRUS OUTBREAK THIS YEAR, AFFECTING PASSENGERS AND CREW&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt;

because of the risk of organ damage and death," according to the World Health Organization (WHO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an Oct. 3 notice from WHO, there have been 445,000 suspected and confirmed cases of chikungunya and 155 deaths worldwide between January and September 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Bangladesh, WHO reported 700 suspected chikungunya cases in the capital, Dhaka, between January and September 2025, citing the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/cdc-warns-enhanced-virus-risk-travelers-amid-outbreak-spread-mosquitoes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC WARNS OF 'ENHANCED' VIRUS RISK FOR TRAVELERS AMID OUTBREAK SPREAD BY MOSQUITOES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt;

established to help support the family — particularly her mother, Terese, who had to take time off work to stay with her daughter in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the fundraiser explained, Joyce had been diagnosed with a rare blood disorder, which “left her immune system compromised, her organs with extreme inflammation resulting in her body retaining a ton of fluid.” The once active teen — she was a member of the Ohio State Club Dance Team and active in her parish’s youth ministry program — was left bedridden due to the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Cailin Joyce, 19, died from a rare disorder caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cailin has been contained to 4 tiny walls in a hospital room for many weeks now as doctors try to understand more about her rare condition. This has come with daily blood draws, blood transfusions, bone marrow tests and so many more treatments that I can’t even remember the names of,” the GoFundMe explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cailin is unable to do simple tasks that many healthy individuals take for granted. Things such as hugging people, going outside, taking a hot shower and being around people are all tasks Cailin cannot partake in. She fatigues quickly making it hard for her to walk short distances. Things like living in the dorms, dining in dining halls, going to OSU football games, going to in person classes, going to Mass [at] the Newman Center and even dancing are all things she hasn’t been able to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus often won’t cause symptoms, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23469-epstein-barr-virus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains. When it does present with symptoms, it’s most often as &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/florida-teen-dies-after-contracting-mononucleosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mononucleosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mononucleosis&lt;/a&gt; (which causes fever and fatigue) in young adults and children. Although it wasn’t specified which blood disorder Joyce developed, EBV can cause a handful of rare — but lethal — conditions, including &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5770746/#S6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chronic active Epstein–Barr virus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chronic active Epstein–Barr virus&lt;/a&gt;, which is when the infection is unable to be controlled, or &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557776/#:~:text=Pathophysiology,resulting%20in%20target%20cell%20degradation." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis,&lt;/a&gt; which is a “a devastating, hyperinflammatory condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 4, the fundraiser announced that “in the past twenty-four hours, Cailin’s condition took a sudden and significant turn for the worse, and despite the extraordinary care she received and the many prayers lifted for her healing, she passed away peacefully, surrounded by love.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cailin Joyce/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; Cailin Joyce&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her teammates on the Ohio State Club Dance Team wrote a post on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR-IZUOjgHe/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; in her honor, remembering her as “kind, humble, determined, loyal and oh so funny.

Concord and Penacook wastewater treatment plants also track data but did not report any norovirus information at the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2,500 reported norovirus outbreaks a year&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. Some health experts worry that the variant GII.17, which was responsible for last year’s spike, may have mutated and become more contagious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3080904/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;GII.4 strain dominated norovirus outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; for more than 30 years, but last year, the GII.17 mutation was responsible for about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;75 percent of outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Atmar, professor in the Department of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/norovirus-2025-spread-rise-contagious-symptoms-experts-what-know-rcna244719" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told NBC News&lt;/a&gt; there are two possibilities: Either the virus changed to make it more transmissible, or changes in the population made more people susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And probably it’s a combination of both,” Atmar said. “But whether it’s going to persist this year, I think, is one of the big questions in our scientific community.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the GII.17 strain include forceful vomiting, intense diarrhea and stomach cramps that are especially hard on children under 5, adults over 85, and those with underlying health conditions, according to the CDC. Dehydration is a primary risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because GII.17 is a new strain, people have less built-up immunity and may experience more severe illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When new strains emerge, people are exposed to a strain that they have not previously been exposed to, and hence are more likely to get infected,” Lee-Ann Jaykus, a professor in the Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences at North Carolina State University, &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/winter-vomiting-disease-surges-ahead-of-schedule-norovirus-11154741" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Historically, new strains emerge every seven to 10 years, and we were due for one, so this is not surprising,” Jaykus said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vigorous hand-washing with hot water and soap and other good hygiene practices are crucial to limit the spread of norovirus. It spreads easily, either through direct contact with someone who is sick, eating food or drinking liquids contaminated with the virus, touching contaminated surfaces, and poor hand-washing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor's note: &lt;/strong&gt;This post was scripted by another Patch staffer, not New Hampshire's editor, for publication on New Hampshire sites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 22:58:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
