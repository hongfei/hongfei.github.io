Dr Vaish highlights, “We routinely see patients complaining of unexplained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/mumbai-orthopaedic-surgeon-explains-why-knee-pain-worsens-in-winter-shares-causes-symptoms-and-easy-tips-to-manage-it-101765811662475.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="knee pain"&gt;knee pain&lt;/a&gt;, backache, and muscle fatigue during winter. In many cases, the underlying cause turns out to be Vitamin D deficiency aggravated by lack of sun exposure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He explains that vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption and bone mineralisation. When sunlight-driven synthesis drops, nutritional sources play a compensatory role - and a thoughtful winter diet can significantly help prevent deficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fatty fishes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Dr Vaish, salmon, mackerel, sardines and tuna are among the richest natural sources of vitamin D. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He recommends including them regularly in your diet - at least two to three times a week - as this can help support bone density and muscle strength.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He notes, “Vitamin D from fatty fish is highly bioavailable and supports joint health, particularly in individuals with early arthritis or age-related bone loss.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Egg yolks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Rathi emphasises that egg yolks are often the most overlooked source, but they provide a steady amount of vitamin D, along with essential fats. For non-vegetarians, eggs are an easy addition to winter meals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He explains, “Egg yolks are nutritionally dense and help improve vitamin D intake without major dietary changes. When consumed sensibly, they benefit immunity and musculoskeletal health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/24/original/photo-1699892726871-22e77ee1b75b_1766582217747.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Egg yolks are a great source of vitamin D.(Unsplash)" title="Egg yolks are a great source of vitamin D.(Unsplash)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Egg yolks are a great source of vitamin D.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fortified foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fortified milk, yoghurt, cereals, and plant-based milk alternatives have emerged as practical vitamin D sources, especially for vegetarians. These foods are widely recommended during winter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Rathi notes, “Fortified foods are extremely useful for people who spend most of their day indoors - office workers, students, and elderly individuals - who get minimal sun exposure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;UV-exposed and sun-dried mushrooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Dr Rathi, certain mushrooms naturally produce vitamin D when exposed to ultraviolet light, making them another great source. Sun-dried mushrooms can be incorporated into curries, soups, and stir-fries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He explains, “This is one of the few plant-based natural Vitamin D options and works well for those avoiding animal products.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cod liver oil and select dairy products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Vaish highlights that cod liver oil remains one of the most concentrated dietary sources of vitamin D. Cheese and butter contribute smaller amounts but can support daily intake when eaten as part of a balanced diet. He cautions, “While food helps maintain levels, individuals with deficiency may still require medical supplementation after proper testing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a season when sunlight is limited, informed dietary planning and expert advice remain the most effective tools to safeguard long-term health. Both doctors stress that persistent bone pain, muscle cramps, fatigue, or frequent infections during winter should not be ignored. Dr Vaish concludes, “Timely screening, dietary correction, and guided supplementation can prevent long-term bone and joint complications.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Adding to this, Dr Rathi emphasises a preventive approach, stating, “Vitamin D deficiency is not just a bone issue - it impacts immunity, energy levels, and overall well-being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Winter should be seen as a time to proactively support the body through nutrition, testing when required, and medical guidance rather than waiting for symptoms to appear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;A study published in 2022 found a tenuous but plausible link between picking your nose and an increased risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases where picking at your nose causes internal tissue damage, critical species of bacteria have a clearer path to the brain, which responds to their presence in ways that resemble signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="182682" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are numerous caveats here, not the least of which is that the supporting research so far is in mice rather than humans, but the findings are definitely worth further investigation – and could improve our understanding of how Alzheimer's disease starts, which remains something of a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-new-compound-reverses-alzheimers-symptoms-in-rats"&gt;Simple New Compound Reverses Alzheimer's Symptoms in Rats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers led by scientists from Griffith University in Australia ran tests with a bacterium called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydia_pneumoniae"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chlamydia pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can infect humans and cause  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="182682" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004300050071"&gt;also been discovered&lt;/a&gt; in the majority of human brains affected by late-onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video below has a summary of the study's findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was demonstrated that in mice, the bacteria could travel up the olfactory nerve (joining the nasal cavity and the brain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, when there was damage to the nasal epithelium (the thin tissue along the roof of the nasal cavity), nerve infections got worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to the mouse brains depositing more of the amyloid-beta protein – a protein that is released in response to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaques (or clumps) of this protein are also found in significant concentrations in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-how-alzheimer-s-causes-cells-to-overheat-and-fry-like-eggs"&gt;people with Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're the first to show that &lt;em&gt;Chlamydia pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; can go directly up the nose and into the brain where it can set off pathologies that look like Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://news.griffith.edu.au/2022/10/28/new-research-suggests-nose-picking-could-increase-risk-for-alzheimers-and-dementia/"&gt;said neuroscientist James St John&lt;/a&gt; from Griffith University in Australia, when the study was published in October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We saw this happen in a mouse model, and the evidence is potentially scary for humans as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists were surprised by the speed at which &lt;em&gt;C. pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; took hold in the central nervous system of the mice, with infection happening within 24 to 72 hours. It's thought that bacteria and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="182682" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; see the nose as a quick route to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not certain that the effects will be the same in humans, or even that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-have-a-new-theory-about-what-causes-alzheimers-and-its-not-plaque"&gt;amyloid-beta plaques are a cause of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, it's nevertheless important to follow up promising leads in the fight to understand this common neurodegenerative condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148468" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/amyloid_plaques_642.jpg" alt="Mouse Study Suggests Surprising Link Between Alzheimer's And Nose-Picking" class="wp-image-148468 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/amyloid_plaques_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/amyloid_plaques_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148468" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of amyloid-beta protein plaques, in orange.

In fact, it's possible &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/nose-picking"&gt;as many as 9 out of 10 people&lt;/a&gt; do it… not to mention a bunch of other species (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weve-caught-aye-aye-using-its-wacky-long-finger-for-something-pretty-gnarly"&gt;some a little more adept&lt;/a&gt; than others).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benefits aren't clear, studies like this one should give us pause before picking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies into the same processes in humans are planned – but until then, St John and his colleagues suggest that picking your nose and plucking your nose hair is "not a good idea" because of the potential damage it does to protective nose tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want to damage the inside of our nose and picking and plucking can do that," &lt;a href="https://news.griffith.edu.au/2022/10/28/new-research-suggests-nose-picking-could-increase-risk-for-alzheimers-and-dementia/"&gt;warned St John&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you damage the lining of the nose, you can increase how many bacteria can go up into your brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148469" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148469" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/child_picking_nose_642.jpg" alt="child picking their nose" class="wp-image-148469 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/child_picking_nose_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/child_picking_nose_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148469" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Nose picking: not just a habit for small children.

Every Thursday, our contributing editor will address your conundrums, with no hesitation and no sugarcoating—just straight-up Tough Love. This week, Abigail answers a question from Julia (that’s not her real name), who’s considering severing ties with her brother because he won’t vaccinate his kids.

My brother and his wife refuse to vaccinate their children—unless they’re forced to, like when their kids were kicked out of school for being unvaccinated, specifically for not having the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) jab. We’ve tried to be nonjudgmental in our questions and suggested compromises on ways we can interact, but every conversation feels like we’re speaking different languages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of a broader pattern of unsafe choices that make it hard to spend time together. My brother and his wife have driven more than once on the highway without putting their infant in a car seat because “he cries too much.” They also brought their kids, who had fevers, to our 100-year-old grandfather’s birthday party. Moments like these leave me feeling anxious, angry, and unsure whether I can trust them around my own family (I have three young children).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love my brother, and I’ve always believed family should matter. But the disconnect in our values and basic safety standards feels enormous, and I’m starting to wonder if the healthiest choice is to step back. We don’t have a cool uncle willing to intervene; otherwise, I would go that route. So what do I do? Do I sever ties? Should I keep trying to reconcile or is it okay to accept that not all relationships can be fixed?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I navigate the guilt, the love, and the need to protect my own family?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time I lost my little brother, he was 4. We were in our local Lord &amp;amp; Taylor, where he’d crept inside a fountain of racked clothing and ducked down so I wouldn’t see him. I tore through the racks, crying his name, until I found him smiling, thinking he had won this round of hide-and-seek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Free Press</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 21:43:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE5xbWQ2a3R1ZGNjUzNwaFpRcWVXRDMzZkwzNFBhVFRsNzJGaEtyMFQteVBJb0prZzgzdVZkS0R0R3hkNndCaTVwODU5aHNFaVdJNkE4LUw1UWVKakFvdlplQ2xEd0MyVE9iSUE</guid></item><item><title>波士顿、威斯特伯勒可能有麻疹暴露，官员警告-《波士顿环球报》</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/24/metro/massachusetts-measles-alert/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local partners to identify and notify those who may have been exposed, officials said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious, airborne disease, which has increased significantly in the United States because of the unfortunate decrease in vaccination rates. It is also a preventable disease,” Public Health Commissioner Dr. Robbie Goldstein said in a statement. “This current situation serves as an important reminder of the critical role vaccination plays in protecting our communities.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While Massachusetts has not had a measles case this year, the United States has seen the highest number of nationwide cases in more than a decade – nearly 2,000 in 44 jurisdictions, which included three confirmed deaths from measles, Goldstein said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Fifteen years ago, measles had been considered eliminated in the United States, but that tremendous progress is at risk,” Goldstein said. “Vaccines are one of the most important public health interventions ever – they are safe, effective, and lifesaving.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Officials said the exposures may have occurred at Logan Airport Terminal B on Dec. 11 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:45 p.m.; at the DoubleTree hotel in Westborough from 3:30 p.m. on Dec. 11 to 9 p.m. on Dec. 12; and at Logan Airport Terminal C from 6 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on Dec. 12.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Those who could have been exposed and begin to develop symptoms of measles should call their healthcare provider before visiting an office, clinic, or emergency department,” public health officials said in the statement. “Visiting a healthcare facility may put others at risk and should be avoided if possible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Those who have had measles in the past or have received two doses of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine are unlikely to develop measles even if they were exposed, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Boston Public Health Commissioner Dr. Bisola Ojikutu also encouraged people to get vaccinated for measles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“With multiple measles outbreaks across the country and increased travel around the holidays, now is an important time to ensure that you and your family are protected,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Ojikutu said two doses of MMR vaccine are 97 percent effective at preventing measles and provide protection against mumps and rubella. Children should receive the vaccine at 12-15 months of age and again before kindergarten, she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Children who are at least 6 months old and traveling internationally or to areas of the US with active outbreaks should receive an early dose of vaccine before traveling, Ojikutu said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It is never too late for children or adults to get the measles vaccine even if they are past the recommended age,” Ojikutu said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Early symptoms of measles occur one to three weeks after exposure and may resemble a cold, with symptoms fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes. A rash occurs on the skin two to four days after the initial symptoms develop and usually appears first on the head, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;People with measles may be contagious up to four days before the rash appears and for four days after the rash starts, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;State public health officials are urging anyone who has not been vaccinated or doesn’t know their measles immunization status to contact their healthcare provider to get vaccinated with at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Measles vaccine given within 72 hours of exposure may prevent measles disease,” officials said in the statement. “Vaccination beyond this window will provide protection from subsequent exposures.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjhh5esz000o3b79ovij47bn@published"&gt;My wife and I used to attend sex parties all the time. Ever since she got pregnant, that came to a halt. Our son is now nearly a year old, and I’m really eager to return to the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjhm50pl003q3b797fkwyevp@published"&gt;However, she says that because we have a kid now, that chapter of our lives needs to remain closed. It’s not like we would be hosting parties at our place, and the fact that we have a kid seems neither here nor there in terms of going back to what we were doing. How can I ease her hang-ups?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjhh5f0r000r3b79ijey3535@published"&gt;Regardless of the fact that you’ll likely creep into coercion territory, convincing a person to have sex they aren’t comfortable with is a recipe for destroying your relationship. You don’t ease your wife’s hang-ups. You respect her current boundaries. Where you’re saying your son is nearly a year old, I’m seeing a woman who is not even a year out from giving birth for the first time. Your wife’s position might change again if you can exercise patience. If you push the subject, though, you’re likely to create distance, resentment, and a rigid and eternal “no” on this practice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjhh5f3b000s3b7911mq45mp@published"&gt;It feels telling that you omit any mention of what your wife’s reasons are for her decision. OK, yes, because the two of you have a child, but is this about fear of STIs? Does the fact of motherhood mean a change in the boundaries of what she considers acceptable conduct? Has something about the physical and hormonal process of pregnancy changed her relationship to her body or her desires? Is it that time with your infant, or protecting precious sleep, is a higher priority, and sex parties interfere with that? It doesn’t seem like you have this information, and it does seem like you’ve assumed one (probably not the actual case) reason and immediately dismissed it. If you do want to understand your wife’s reasoning, ask her with genuine curiosity. Those answers are likely to help you come to terms with this particular manifestation of the fact that your lives are profoundly different now, because they need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

What are the emotional needs that were being met? Excitement? Novelty? Attention? Can you come up with potential ways to satisfy those desires while staying within your wife’s boundaries? This can be a second conversation. If you’re able to really hear your wife, and she’s able to feel that you’re hearing her, there will probably be at least some room for compromise and negotiation. This has to be collaborative, though, and you’ll be wise to proceed cautiously, gently, and with grace extended regarding how she may be reacting to the massive life experience she’s just been through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjhhdohb001q3b794pdcv7ox@published"&gt;Recently, my long-term boyfriend got me a new dildo. It’s pale green, fairly large, and has stylized eyes painted onto it. I thought it looked freaky, but he thought it was funny and it went to live on the rack with most of our other sex toys near the bed. It’s never actually been used for any sexual activity, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/04/haunted-dildo-sex-advice.html"&gt;but I thought I’d try it under the right circumstances…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Five years on, the picture has grown darker and stranger than most would have imagined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus has infected hundreds of millions of farm animals, spilled into mammals at an unprecedented scale, devastated wildlife, and – in the United States – established itself in dairy cattle, a species no one expected to see implicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human cases remain rare. But virologists say the trajectory is troubling, the data patchy and the future uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s now a global problem,” says &lt;a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/infectionimmunity/staff/edwardhutchinson/"&gt;Dr Ed Hutchinson&lt;/a&gt;, professor of molecular and cellular virology at the University of Glasgow. “As a disease of wild animals, it’s completely out of control. It’s raging around the world, and there’s no feasible containment method other than just watching it infect huge populations of animals.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How quickly has the virus spread?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current lineage of H5N1 emerged in Asia in the late 1990s and has since swept from continent to continent. Since 2020, a particularly aggressive branch of the virus – known to scientists as clade 2.3.4.4b – has spread explosively through wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;180 million poultry&lt;/a&gt; have been infected in the US alone, and over &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock"&gt;1,000 dairy farms&lt;/a&gt; have reported outbreaks. Egg prices have soared, and the US government has spent more than &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48518"&gt;$1.19bn&lt;/a&gt; (£881m) reimbursing farmers for losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the human toll remains limited: only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;71 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; in the US, resulting in two deaths. Historically, though, H5N1 has been far deadlier: since 2003, &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20250131.pdf"&gt;almost half&lt;/a&gt; of all known human infections globally have proved fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, something unprecedented has happened. In early 2024, H5N1 was found in dairy cattle in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was to everyone’s astonishment,” Hutchinson says, “You now have a situation where a large proportion of consumer milk in the US at any given time contains genetic material from these highly pathogenic viruses.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, pasteurisation destroys the virus. But raw milk, along with close contact for workers on dairy farms, still poses significant risks of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/12/eggs.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="A customer, holding a carton of eggs, is seen during shopping at a supermarket as packages of eggs are seen on the shelves of the egg aisle in New York City, United States on December 20, 2024." class="wp-image-210606"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Average egg prices in the US peaked at more than $6 (£4.40 approx) per dozen in March 2025 as swathes of flocks of hens were culled due to bird flu infections - Photo credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That unexpected species jump – along with growing evidence of infection in mammals from seals to foxes to bears – increases opportunities for the virus to change and adapt. Flu viruses are unusually good at evolving because their genome is segmented. If two different strains infect the same host cell, their gene segments can mix and match, producing a new hybrid virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process, known as genome reassortment, has played a key role in sparking past pandemics, and many experts are concerned the same could happen if a person infected with a human influenza were also infected with bird flu. This may, for example, allow the virus to gain the ability to transmit effectively in humans, while maintaining a structure which is alien and undetectable to our immune systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a sense,” Hutchinson says, “the question about reassortment is not ‘When is it going to happen?’, but ‘Why isn't it happening all the time?’ Because there are so many influenza variants out there, and we don't really know the barriers to it taking off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond farms and factories, the outbreak has become a wildlife crisis. In South America, mass die-offs have struck &lt;a href="https://eswi.org/education-hub/pacific-and-atlantic-sea-lion-mortality-caused-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sea lions&lt;/a&gt;. And on the Antarctic coast, almost half of the world’s female breeding population of southern elephant seals may already have been killed, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-09014-7"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The US: epicentre and outlier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US today is one of the most active hotspots for avian influenza transmission. Yet the national response is fragmented. Farm biosecurity measures remain the primary line of defence, even as&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/bird-flu-airborne-usda-pandemic"&gt; evidence grows&lt;/a&gt; that the virus may be travelling between farms on the wind – a mode that fences, disinfectant and clean boots cannot stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, virologists say monitoring and reporting are weakening. US surveillance varies dramatically between states, complicating assessments of how widespread H5N1 infections really are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/biosciences/people/1028/rossman-jeremy"&gt;Dr Jeremy Rossman&lt;/a&gt;, honorary senior lecturer in virology at the University of Kent, says effective containment hinges on broad, coordinated surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This requires extensive surveillance of infection in multiple animal populations, as well as monitoring and testing for animal workers at these farms,” he says. “This can allow for management of any infected flocks or herds, rapid identification of human spillover cases and early detection of new mutations in the virus that may affect transmissibility.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the US, Rossman argues, that isn’t happening consistently. “The response is more limited and variable from state to state and farm to farm,” he says. “Without strategic and coordinated surveillance and containment, the risks of a human transmissible H5N1 virus will steadily rise, with unknown, but potentially critical consequences.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hutchinson shares this concern. Not only are human and animal infections rising, he says, but data sharing has become patchier and harder to interpret, raising the risk that early warning signs could be missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that effective vaccines already exist to protect both humans and animals – and the US is thought to have &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2025/01/22/the-us-has-bird-flu-vaccines-heres-why-you-cant-get-one/"&gt;millions of doses stockpiled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How successful is vaccination? France adopted poultry vaccination in 2023 and saw outbreaks fall by&lt;a href="https://avinews.com/en/france-avian-influenza-nearly-eradicated-thanks-to-vaccination/#:~:text=France%20has%20achieved%20a%20major,vaccination%20campaign%20in%20October%202023."&gt; 96 per cent&lt;/a&gt; in two years, which is impressive. But progress elsewhere has been slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, poultry producers and lawmakers have opposed vaccination on trade grounds, warning that it could harm export markets and cost the chicken industry &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48518"&gt;$10bn&lt;/a&gt; (£7.4bn) if other countries ban US meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is despite the outbreak already costing the country billions of dollars, not least ordinary people whose grocery bills have risen as egg prices &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000708111"&gt;soared 300 per cent&lt;/a&gt; in 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/12/bird-flu-virus.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Colorised transmission electron micrograph of avian influenza A H5N1 virus particles (gold)." class="wp-image-210607"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This transmission electron micrograph shows avian influenza A H5N1 particles (gold), grown in a cell culture (blue) - Credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;So how worried should we be?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central fear is human-to-human transmission. So far, it has not happened in any sustained way. But influenza evolves fast, and every new infected host is another throw of the genetic dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rossman warns that high levels of circulation across species increase the odds “of the virus evolving into a strain that has both high transmissibility and high lethality. Given the catastrophic implications if it did, tracking and mitigating the spread of H5N1 virus is of critical importance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reasons for optimism: vaccines and antivirals should be effective against avian influenza, and the world is far better prepared thanks to lessons learned from COVID, particularly in diagnostics and global surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are caveats too. Scaling vaccines to a global population would take time; antiviral resistance has already appeared in poultry in Canada, and our immunity to H1 and H3 seasonal flu offers little protection against H5 strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the sharpest warning comes from computer modelling of an outbreak. A 2025 &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-025-25358-5"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Indian researchers found that once a pandemic strain began spreading in humans, the window for effective containment could be just 2 to 10 detected cases. Beyond that, containment would become almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What happens next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2026 begins, H5N1 is circulating in more species, across more continents, than ever before. It is entrenched in global wildlife. It has destabilised farming. It is mutating, spreading and defying prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hutchinson’s message is clear: vigilance, not panic. “There are reasons to hope as well as reasons to be alarmed,” he says. “But there’s definitely no reason to be relaxed about this one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What scientists want next is simple: more surveillance, more transparency, more vaccination and more urgency, especially in the United States, where the virus is spreading rapidly, and surveillance remains uneven. Whether they’ll get their wishes, however, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;They say a mother’s intuition is key – but a mother’s information may help you do the best job possible when advocating for your child.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A while back, I shared &lt;a href="https://betweencarpools.com/one-trick-make-sure-never-forget-dose-antibiotics/"&gt;this medicine hack&lt;/a&gt; that was recently discovered by my much younger sister-in-law, who found it to be a game-changer for her and her friends. As I was discussing another parenting and medical idea with her, she encouraged me to share it with the BCP readers. Thanks, Tzipora, for being my cheerleader!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-prata-font-family"&gt;In my experience, navigating Western medicine requires us to be our own advocates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, with the convenience of urgent care centers and late hours, we often find ourselves in various medical offices with our children. However, this can also mean that no one is keeping track of our kids’ medical history for us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why I started a note on my phone called “The Family Health Log.” I listed my children’s names and underlined them, then created bullets for each medical episode, including the treatment and sometimes a brief note. This simple hack has helped me stay organized and informed, and I hope it can do the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a sneak peak at what a segment of my log looks like : &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[Child’s Name]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;•⁠  ⁠March 16th, 2020: Strep (rapid positive) – Cephalexin for 10 days&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;•⁠  ⁠May 27th, 2020: Strep (overnight positive) – Amoxycillin (switched to Duricef after 4 days)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;•⁠  ⁠Feb 25th, 2021: Toe infection – Cephalexin&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;•⁠  ⁠April 26th, 2021: Strep (positive after multiple cultures and behavioral issues) – Duricef&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;•⁠  ⁠July 15th, 2021: Toe infection – Duricef&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This tool is especially valuable for young parents who travel frequently, perhaps between Eretz Yisroel, their childhood home for Bain Hazmanim, and their in-laws in another city. With their baby experiencing recurring ear infections in different locations, it can be challenging to keep track of treatments and dates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This smart tool allows a responsible mom to maintain a detailed list of dates and treatments, making it easier to share with an ENT specialist and determine the best course of action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another example of how the Health Log proved helpful. My nine-year-old was complaining of frequent headaches, and I couldn’t quite pinpoint the cause. I decided to track the occurrences, jotting down the date and time in his Health Log whenever he mentioned a headache. After a few weeks, a pattern emerged: his headaches always seemed to occur on Sunday evenings. Armed with this insight, we made a few adjustments – we shifted his bedtime on Motzai Shabbos and added an extra water bottle to his Sunday backpack. The headaches significantly decreased. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark class="has-inline-color"&gt;My camera roll has also been an empowering tracking tool, as long as it’s organized.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I learned from BCP to caption photos and I’ve created and labeled albums to monitor specific issues. For example, track your teen’s acne journey for a couple of months to identify which creams or medicines are most effective, and have photos readily available to share with their dermatologist. I’ve used this hack to track my son’s eczema journey, and it’s been incredibly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-prata-font-family"&gt;While playing the big sister role,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d like to share a tip that seemed obvious to me until a great-grandmother told me she wasn’t aware of it. When you or your child take antibiotics, try to wait 2–3 hours before giving probiotics or a yogurt/probiotic snack. Don’t stress if the timing isn’t perfect – even 1.5 hours can make a difference. Waiting 2–3 hours helps protect against diarrhea, upset stomach, diaper rash, and yeast infections caused by antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just a heads up, sometimes kids can throw up after taking antibiotics. If that happens, definitely check with your pediatrician, but I’ve heard that if it’s more than 30 minutes after the dose, it’s probably absorbed and you don’t need to worry about giving another one. Best to get their advice, though!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-prata-font-family"&gt;The last tip is one I’ve found incredibly helpful:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark class="has-inline-color"&gt;I often ask a doctor for permission to record or film a visit.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s why. When I’m with my infant and we’re at the ENT for a procedure like a tongue clip, I can’t focus on the nurse’s instructions while tending to my screaming baby. By filming the exercises, I can review them later at a calmer time. Similarly, when I take a child to a specialist and am hit with a lot of information or options, it’s hard to retain everything to discuss with my spouse later. Recording the consult (with the doctor’s permission) or taking notes on my phone helps me process the information and make informed decisions. This is especially useful if I’m seeking a second opinion and want to compare perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope this share brings you and your family the same benefits it’s brought mine. Wishing you a winter filled with health, happiness, and fewer unexpected doctor visits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sure, oats themselves are chock &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/benefits-of-oatmeal" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;full of benefits&lt;/a&gt; and nutrients. Rich in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/dietitians-favorite-high-fiber-foods-11819806" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt;, they’re good for your gut and heart health. They’re also known for providing &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/grain-with-more-energy-boosting-power-than-quinoa-or-brown-rice-11760171" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;steady energy levels&lt;/a&gt;, stabilizing blood sugar, and reducing the risk of some diseases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Clearly, oatmeal is a healthy food to eat daily…so long as it’s not the kind that’s filled with sugar. So what happens when you eat oatmeal for breakfast, day-in and day-out? We spoke to RDs to find out.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Oatmeal is a nutrient powerhouse, packed with soluble fiber, especially beta-glucan, plus &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-b-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;B-vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, iron, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-antioxidants-than-blueberries-11773725" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;,” says Brannon Blount, RDN, a registered dietitian in Danville, Virginia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s a closer look at the nutrient profile of 40 grams (about ½ cup dry) of rolled oats, according to USDA&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2346396/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;data:&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calories:&lt;/strong&gt; 153&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbohydrates:&lt;/strong&gt; 27.5 grams (g)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; 4.16 g&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beta-glucan:&lt;/strong&gt; 3.01 g&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein:&lt;/strong&gt; 5.4 g&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat:&lt;/strong&gt; 2.36 g&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.74 milligrams (mg)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; 50.4 mg&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B1 (Thiamine):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.162 mg&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B9 (Folate):&lt;/strong&gt; 12.8 micrograms (µg)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These nutrients look great on paper, but they’re also associated with a variety of positive health effects. Many of them can be chalked up to the fiber content, particularly a type of fiber known as beta-glucan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Oatmeal is a fabulous source of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/what-are-refined-carbs" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;complex carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, and contains fiber that helps to prevent blood sugar spikes and supports sustained energy between meals,” explains Jenny Finke, MS, RD, a registered dietitian who specializes in women’s and metabolic health in Greenwich, Connecticut. “One serving of oatmeal packs around 4 grams of fiber, specifically beta-glucan, a viscous, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/soluble-fiber-vs-insoluble-fiber" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; known for various health benefits, including lowering cholesterol and improving blood sugar control.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research on oatmeal really says it all. In one trial, an oat beverage rich in beta-glucan was shown to significantly lower cholesterol &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;heart disease risk&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. “Oatmeal offers cardiovascular benefits that are often overlooked,” Finke says. Additional research has demonstrated the anti-obesity&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and antioxidant&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; properties of oats, much of which emphasizes the role of beta-glucan. Finally, oats are known for helping balance blood sugar levels, and these benefits can even be see in people with type 2 diabetes&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, the gut-friendliness of fiber can’t be ignored. &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-foods-11690551" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;High-fiber foods&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/healthiest-grains" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; like oats, are associated with improving a variety of GI issues, such as constipation and diarrhea&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Since the majority of Americans currently don’t get enough fiber&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, oats are that much more attractive for those looking to increase their intake of this essential nutrient. Oats may also provide some protection against colorectal cancer, research suggests&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fiber, namely beta-glucan, in oats is only scratching the surface. RDs also point out that it provides a plethora of micronutrients. “Oats are surprisingly rich in minerals for such an affordable &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-shelf-stable-foods-11740097" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pantry staple&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/manganese-benefits-7568287" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;manganese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-magnesium-than-almonds-11810536" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, iron, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-zinc-7511268" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, and copper,” Finke says. She adds that many of the nutrients in oats (e.g. fiber, iron, magnesium, etc.) are generally not consumed enough in the United States, further demonstrating how upping your oat intake could fill nutritional gaps.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s a ton of research behind the nutrients in and benefits of oatmeal. In some contexts, oats are even considered a &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-superfoods-right-now-according-to-registered-dietitians-11740552" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;superfood&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s one thing to &lt;em&gt;read &lt;/em&gt;about the perks of oats—it’s another to &lt;em&gt;incorporate &lt;/em&gt;them into your daily life, reaping the benefits one day at a time. Here’s what could happen over the short- and long-term if oats become your &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/why-eating-the-same-breakfast-every-day-might-be-the-healthiest-choice-11859026" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;staple breakfast&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you first start eating oats daily, you may notice some of the effects fairly quickly. “Many people notice they &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-start-eating-healthier-8425807" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;snack less&lt;/a&gt; and feel more sustained energy throughout the morning,” Blount says. At the same time, there may be an adjustment period if &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-lunch-ideas-that-ll-help-power-you-through-your-work-day-8633615" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; aren’t the norm for you. “For some, the jump in fiber can cause bloating or gas—especially if they’re not used to whole grains,” Blount adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What about the long-term effects of eating oatmeal daily? “Daily oatmeal can improve cholesterol levels, support &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/gut-healthy-breakfast-ideas-8758625" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, regulate appetite, and stabilize blood sugar,” Blount says, adding that it’s perfectly safe for most adults to eat oatmeal every day. Some of these effects could also lead to a reduced risk of certain diseases, such as heart disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finke is such a fan of daily oatmeal, she frequently recommends it to her clients &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;eats it herself. However, not all bowls of oatmeal are equal. “When eating oatmeal daily, it’s important to choose minimally sweetened options to limit added sugars and preserve blood sugar benefits,” Finke explains. She also shares an important reminder that no one food provides &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the nutrients your body needs. This is why the ingredients you mix into and add on top of your oatmeal are also important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In case you need inspiration, Finke shared her very own oatmeal combo: “The breakfast I make as a dietitian specializing in metabolic health is a bowl of oatmeal mixed with protein powder and a couple of tablespoons of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/chia-seeds-vs-flax-seeds-11709668" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, then topped with a dollop of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/easy-ways-to-add-greek-yogurt-to-your-diet-11810883" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of berries. This combination delivers complex carbohydrates from the oats, along with high-quality protein, calcium, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-omega-3-11695043" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;omega-3 healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, and plenty of fiber.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Health, via its Chemistry, Food and Drug Division, has announced a voluntary recall affecting specific lots of bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a generic medication used to treat hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affected lots are 17232401 (expiring November 2025), 17232401 (expiring November 2025), 17232401 (expiring November 2025), 17240974 (expiring May 2026), 17240974 (expiring May 2026) and 17240974 (expiring May 2026).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recall was initiated by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc in coordination with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after routine quality testing identified a potential cross-contamination issue. Trace amounts of another drug, ezetimibe, a medication used to treat high cholesterol, were detected in reserve samples of the product, which should not have been present in the blood-pressure medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 11,136 bottles of these products have been affected by the recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While FDA’s classification of this recall is Class III, indicating that exposure to the trace contaminant is not likely to cause adverse health effects, the ministry is urging appropriate precaution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry advised that people who may have purchased or are currently in possession of the affected products to discontinue use immediately and return the medication to the place of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said anyone with health concerns should consult with their healthcare provider as patients should not abruptly stop antihypertensive medication without professional guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;For more than a century, Alzheimer's disease has been widely viewed as permanent and untreatable once it begins. As a result, most research has focused on preventing the disease or slowing its progression rather than attempting to reverse it.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;By studying multiple mouse models of Alzheimer's alongside human Alzheimer's brain tissue, researchers identified a critical biological problem at the center of the disease. They found that the brain's inability to maintain healthy levels of a vital cellular energy molecule called NAD+ plays a major role in driving Alzheimer's.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;In animal models, maintaining normal brain NAD+ levels prevented Alzheimer's from developing. Even more striking, restoring NAD+ balance after the disease was already advanced allowed the brain to repair damage and fully restore cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;These results suggest that treatments aimed at restoring the brain's energy balance could potentially move Alzheimer's therapy beyond slowing decline and toward meaningful recovery.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The findings also open the door to further research, including the exploration of complementary strategies and carefully designed clinical trials to determine whether these results can translate to patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Longstanding View of Alzheimer's Is Being Questioned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than 100 years, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been widely viewed as a condition that cannot be undone. Because of this belief, most scientific efforts have focused on preventing the disease or slowing its progression, rather than attempting to restore lost brain function. Even after decades of research and billions of dollars in investment, no drug trial for Alzheimer's has ever been designed with the goal of reversing the disease and recovering cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That long-held assumption is now being challenged by researchers from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center. Their work set out to answer a bold question: can brains already damaged by advanced Alzheimer's recover?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Study Targets Brain Energy Failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Kalyani Chaubey, PhD, of the Pieper Laboratory and published on December 22 in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. By examining both human Alzheimer's brain tissue and multiple preclinical mouse models, the team identified a key biological failure at the center of the disease. They found that the brain's inability to maintain normal levels of a critical cellular energy molecule called NAD+ plays a major role in driving Alzheimer's. Importantly, maintaining proper NAD+ balance was shown to not only prevent the disease but also reverse it in experimental models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAD+ levels naturally decline throughout the body, including the brain, as people age. When NAD+ drops too low, cells lose the ability to carry out essential processes needed for normal function and survival. The researchers discovered that this decline is far more severe in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. The same pattern was seen in mouse models of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Alzheimer's Was Modeled in the Lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Alzheimer's occurs only in humans, scientists study it using specially engineered mice that carry genetic mutations known to cause the disease in people. In this study, researchers used two such models. One group of mice carried multiple human mutations affecting amyloid processing, while the other carried a human mutation in the tau protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid and tau abnormalities are among the earliest and most significant features of Alzheimer's. In both mouse models, these mutations led to widespread brain damage that closely mirrors the human disease. This included breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, damage to nerve fibers, chronic inflammation, reduced formation of new neurons in the hippocampus, weakened communication between brain cells, and extensive oxidative damage. The mice also developed severe memory and cognitive problems similar to those seen in people with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing Whether Alzheimer's Damage Could Be Reversed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After confirming that NAD+ levels dropped sharply in both human and mouse Alzheimer's brains, the team explored two possibilities. They tested whether maintaining NAD+ balance before symptoms appeared could prevent Alzheimer's, and whether restoring that balance after the disease had already progressed could reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach built on the group's earlier work published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA, which showed that restoring NAD+ balance led to both structural and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury. In the current study, the researchers used a well-characterized pharmacologic compound called P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper laboratory, to restore NAD+ balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Cognitive Recovery Observed in Advanced Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Preserving NAD+ balance protected mice from developing Alzheimer's, but even more surprising was what happened when treatment began after the disease was already advanced. In those cases, restoring NAD+ balance allowed the brain to repair the major pathological damage caused by the genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both mouse models showed complete recovery of cognitive function. This recovery was also reflected in blood tests, which showed normalized levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker used to diagnose Alzheimer's in people. These findings provided strong evidence of disease reversal and highlighted a potential biomarker for future human trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers Express Cautious Optimism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were very excited and encouraged by our results," said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH. "Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as Psychiatrist and Investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Shift in How Alzheimer's Is Viewed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a fundamental change in how Alzheimer's could be approached in the future. "The key takeaway is a message of hope -- the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent," said Dr. Pieper. "The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chaubey added, "Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Approach Differs From Supplements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pieper cautioned against confusing this strategy with over the counter NAD+-precursors. He noted that such supplements have been shown in animal studies to raise NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer The method used in this research relies instead on P7C3-A20, a pharmacologic agent that helps cells maintain healthy NAD+ balance during extreme stress, without pushing levels beyond their normal range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery," said Dr. Pieper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps Toward Human Trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also opens the door to additional studies and eventual testing in people. The technology is currently being commercialized by Glengary Brain Health, a Cleveland-based company co-founded by Dr. Pieper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients," Dr. Pieper explained. "Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer's reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In diabetes, it is like the conductor that goes off-beat and the music turns chaotic. Everyone wants to “reverse” that disorder and restore perfect harmony but doctors say that it is more like retuning the orchestra than flipping a switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What diabetes reversal actually means&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When endocrinologists talk about remission rather than reversal, they mean a state where blood glucose levels return to non-diabetic ranges without the need for medications but the underlying susceptibility remains. If lifestyle support is lifted, blood glucose can climb again. This distinction is important and backed by emerging clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remission is possible in type 2 diabetes with intensive lifestyle change. According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1389816" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2012 study published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, “Intensive lifestyle intervention resulted in significantly greater remission of type 2 diabetes compared with standard diabetes support and education.” This landmark study from the US looked at people with type 2 diabetes undergoing a structured lifestyle program with calorie control and increased physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lifestyle group experienced significantly higher rates of diabetes remission compared with the control group, highlighting that how you live matters tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/64/10/3300/34408/Effects-of-Intentional-Weight-Loss-on-Mechanisms" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2015 study in Diabetes journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found, “Modest weight loss was associated with improved insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and metabolic outcomes.” This study shows that even modest weight loss, as little as 5% of body weight, can significantly improve key physiological processes involved in type 2 diabetes. These include insulin sensitivity and how the body manages blood glucose, which supports remission efforts even when medications remain part of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep quality, stress and glucose regulation. As per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.6476" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2017 study in Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; established, “Poor sleep quality and short sleep duration are associated with impaired glucose metabolism and increased risk of type 2 diabetes.” This review highlights an often-neglected piece of the diabetes puzzle: sleep. Poor sleep disrupts hormonal regulation, including insulin sensitivity, demonstrating that lifestyle inputs beyond diet and exercise, like sleep quality and stress reduction, meaningfully influence diabetes outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What experts say about diabetes reversal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to reverse diabetes or is remission a more realistic goal? With diabetes rates ever increasing across the world, many people are questioning if intensive lifestyle changes can significantly improve blood sugar levels and even lessen the need for drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even when talking about diabetes reversal, we must be precise in our terminology," Dr Usha Ayyagari, Endocrinologist at Apollo Clinic in Chennai, shared in an interview with the Times of India. "Remission is a more accurate term, not reversal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to her, remission is possible-albeit mainly possible with early type 2 diabetes and very patient specific. The population of people who enjoy the best results usually see:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Significant and sustained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short duration of diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good blood sugar control prior to intervention&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not required (or not previously required) insulin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will dramatically improve the chances of going into remission," Dr Ayyagari implied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about what type of diabetes can benefited most from lifestyle changes, Dr Ayyagari said that all types of diabetes need lifestyle management but type 2 diabetes, in particular, has the greatest responsiveneness to lifestyle based interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Insulin resistance is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, and it can improve significantly with lifestyle change," explained Dr Ayyagari. "This makes blood sugar control much easier than type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

However, other diabetes-related complications will often require a greater weight loss: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep apnoea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatty liver disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In those cases, a minimum of 15% weight loss, and sometimes more, will be needed,” Dr Ayyagari indicated. Discontinuing medication is not guaranteed but improvements are much more likely. This depends on the same remission factors, said Ayyagari and added that even if a person can’t stop their medicine, there will be improvements in control and these can allow for: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fewer medicines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower doses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less frequent insulin injections&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Or a lesser dose of insulin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, patients will be able to terminate certain medications but they will still need to undergo a treatment program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although diabetes is not reversible, remission is an achievable and evidence-based target, particularly in individuals with early-type 2 diabetes. The most effective tools remain the fundamentals of eating well, exercising on a regular basis, sleeping well, managing stress and reduce their weight and maintain it. Dr Ayyagari concluded, "Lifestyle is the cornerstone of diabetes management - but the health benefits extend beyond blood glucose management."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Sure, toting around your grocery bags can be testing if you’re struggling to remember where you parked, but otherwise, you're probably not picking things up and thinking ‘Wow, I wish I gripped that a bit harder.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, as UK-based physical trainer Ben Dillon (founder of the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.facebook.com/themyoroom/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.facebook.com/themyoroom/"}' href="https://www.facebook.com/themyoroom/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Myo Room&lt;/a&gt; and an expert at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://exercisewithstyle.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://exercisewithstyle.com/"}' href="https://exercisewithstyle.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Exercise With Style&lt;/a&gt;) explains, there’s more to grip strength than you’d think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does ‘grip strength’ really mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Grip strength is defined as the force exerted by the muscles in the hand and forearm to hold onto an object,” explains Dillon. Those muscles include the &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-biceps-exercises"&gt;biceps&lt;/a&gt; brachii and brachioradialis; triceps brachii, the flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris; extensor carpi radialis and extensor carpi ulnaris muscles. But what does this motley collection of muscle fibers actually do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-actually-build-muscle-when-you-work-out-3"&gt;muscles&lt;/a&gt; work together to control the hand’s ability to grip and hold objects of different shapes and sizes, from small objects such as coins to large objects such as a basketball,” says Dillon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is grip strength important in the gym?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, grip strength is important during your workout so that you don’t injure yourself. Deadlifts, pull-ups and kettlebell swings (for example) might not go so well if you’re not able to hold them tight. But good grip strength is also crucial for improving performance and increasing overall strength for exercises like deadlifts, pull-ups, chin-ups, and rows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stronger grip strength allows for better control and stability when performing exercises that place stress on the hands, wrists, and forearms, reducing the risk of overuse injuries or strains,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can good grip strength help with your daily routine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having good grip strength can have a positive impact on day-to-day activities, as it allows for better control and stability in many everyday tasks, including carrying objects, opening jars and bottles, DIY tasks, typing, and general outdoor activities such as gardening,” says Dillon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dillon goes on to point out that a strong grip allows for better control when carrying objects. reducing the risk of dropping or spilling items and can reduce the risk of hand and wrist strain from extended computer use (you know who you are). “Using hand tools, painting, or hanging pictures, with good grip strength will help reduce the risk of hand fatigue and injury,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>gq.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE8xVVdlcmFRcUt5X0V0bWhRaU9jRzZJem03blF1Z2dTWTFrbzRDYTNEb3RTRTI3dVlsWmRBekxuc2FFNEI5THJ2LVFYTW1aMF9hczVzMG9CSDNCX1J2a1hRVkRvOVRITnhaZVE</guid></item><item><title>科学家促进线粒体燃烧更多卡路里- Phys.org</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-12-scientists-boost-mitochondria-calories.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials are issuing a warning about possible &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; exposure in multiple locations in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Public Health announced Wednesday that an out-of-state visitor who spent time in Boston and Westborough earlier this month was diagnosed with measles and visited multiple locations which could have resulted in other people being exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the visitor arrived on Dec. 11 at 2:39 p.m. at Boston Logan International Airport on American Airlines flight 2384 from Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. The visitor stayed at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Boston-Westborough in Westborough and departed the state on Dec. 12 from Logan Airport at 9:19 p.m. on JetBlue flight 117 to Las Vegas, Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state is now working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local partners to identify and notify anyone who might have been exposed to measles from this person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious, airborne disease, which has increased significantly in the United States because of the unfortunate decrease in vaccination rates. It is also a preventable disease,” said Robbie Goldstein, the state's public health commissioner. “This current situation serves as an important reminder of the critical role vaccination plays in protecting our communities. While Massachusetts has not had a measles case this year, 2025 saw the highest number of nationwide cases in more than a decade – nearly 2,000 in 44 jurisdictions, and sadly, three deaths. Fifteen years ago, measles had been considered eliminated in the United States, but that tremendous progress is at risk."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is very contagious. However, the risk to most people in Massachusetts is low because the vaccination rate in the state is high. People who are not immune and visited any of the locations on the following dates and times may be at risk for developing measles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logan Airport Terminal B, Boston, 2:30-4:45 p.m., on Thursday, Dec. 11&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Boston-Westborough, Westborough, between 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, Dec. 11 and 9 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 12&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Logan Airport Terminal C, Boston, 6-11:30 p.m., on Friday Dec. 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who could have been exposed and begin to develop symptoms of measles should call their healthcare provider before visiting an office, clinic, or emergency department. Visiting a healthcare facility may put others at risk and should be avoided if possible. Anyone who has had measles in the past or has received two doses of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is unlikely to develop measles even if exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;/div&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms of measles occur seven to 21 days after exposure and may resemble a cold, with fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes. A rash occurs on the skin two to four days after the initial symptoms develop. The rash usually appears first on the head and then moves downward. It typically lasts a few days and then disappears in the same order. People with measles could be contagious up to four days before the rash appears and for four days after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This case is a reminder that everyone should be vaccinated against measles to protect themselves and others from this highly infectious disease. With multiple measles outbreaks across the country and increased travel around the holidays, now is an important time to ensure that you and your family are protected,” said Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, Boston's commissioner of public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health care providers who suspect they might have measles are urged to call the Department of Public Health at 617-983-6800 for recommendations and testing guidance. Providers in Boston should call the Boston Public Health Commission at 617-534-5611.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say the best way to start your day for hydration is with plain water. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydration supports cognitive function, digestion and many other essential bodily functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To stay hydrated all day, sip water, eat hydrating foods and monitor your hydration status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hydration can feel confusing—between electrolyte drinks, wellness shots and trending morning beverages, it’s hard to know what actually helps. Mornings are an especially important time for hydration, since we naturally lose fluid overnight. It may not be flashy, but the best morning drink is still &lt;strong&gt;plain water.&lt;/strong&gt;

As Hardy, explains, “We typically wake up &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8064290/how-to-tell-if-you-are-dehydrated/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mildly dehydrated&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to overnight respiration, perspiration and urine production.”&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Drinking water shortly after waking helps replenish these losses and potentially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015851/sneaky-reasons-you-wake-up-feeling-tired/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prevent symptoms of fatigue and sluggishness&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jones adds, “After a night of sleep without food and fluid, plain water offers the body what it needs to rehydrate and support optimal energy levels and digestion.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Helps Set the Tone for Healthy Hydration Habits &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting your morning with water can help you stay hydrated throughout the day. Hardy notes that one study found that the first six hours after waking are the prime time that people hydrate. For this reason, she suggests &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7988280/should-you-be-drinking-water-first-thing-in-the-morning/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drinking a glass of water early in the morning&lt;/a&gt;, ideally before reaching for coffee.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jones chimes in, “Because total daily fluid needs are individualized based on body weight, activity level, climate and other factors, there’s no one-size-fits-all for morning fluid recommendations.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a rule of thumb, most women should aim for about 11.5 cups per day and most men about 15.5 cups per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research on the ideal water temperature for hydration is still limited, but one small study found that cool water around 60°F may support comfortable intake and optimal hydration after dehydration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-dietitian-approved-ways-to-stay-hydrated"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other Dietitian-Approved Ways to Stay Hydrated &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavor your water: &lt;/strong&gt;If plain water isn’t appealing, try adding lemon, cucumber, mint or berries for a boost of flavor without added sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy hydrating foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Many fruits and vegetables, such as watermelon, cucumbers, oranges and tomatoes, are composed of over 85% water. Pairing water-rich foods with fluids can help meet hydration needs while also adding essential vitamins and minerals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replenish electrolytes when needed: &lt;/strong&gt;During intense workouts, hot weather or illness, extra electrolytes such as sodium and magnesium can help restore balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stack habits together: &lt;/strong&gt;Jones suggests “stacking water intake with the habits you already have. If that’s a morning cup of coffee, drink water while it’s brewing. If you have a midmorning or afternoon snack packed for work, pair it with water in a reusable bottle.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it appealing:&lt;/strong&gt; Making hydration visually appealing can encourage you to drink more. “Don’t underestimate the power of a cute glass. Some research shows that the shape and fullness of a cup can impact how much and how quickly we drink.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Hardy likes to fill a 40-ounce cup each morning to make steady sipping easier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor your hydration status: &lt;/strong&gt;Use simple cues like thirst and urine color to track your hydration. Pale yellow pee typically indicates adequate hydration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to starting your day hydrated, plain water wins. It’s accessible, inexpensive and consistently supported by research for promoting digestion, cognitive function and overall fluid balance. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting your day with a glass sets a strong foundation, but hydration doesn’t stop there. Steady sipping throughout the day, along with water-rich foods, helps keep fluid levels stable so you feel your best all day long.

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What is the MyCelsius Cooling Bracelet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MyCelsius Cooling Bracelet is a wearable device intended for women experiencing menopausal hot flushes, positioned in the wellness market as a stylish tech solution. Claiming to bring “cooling comfort and help to restore confidence”, it’s designed to instantly cool down wearers who experience hot flushes triggered by menopause, but also alleviates the effects of hormonal changes, stress, anxiety or other everyday factors on body temperature. There’s also a warming mode that you can use in chillier moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bracelet sits in the premium wellness tech price bracket, at £229.99, but it’s positioned as a lifestyle investment rather than a basic gadget. The subtle design doesn’t shout “medical device”, but it’s definitely distinctive, and can be worn day or night. In this review, I’ve tested whether the brand claims live up to real‑life use and assessed whether the investment is justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal"&gt;JUMP TO:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;When testing cooling bracelets, we consider ease of use, cooling effectiveness, comfort and wearability, battery life and reliability, symptom relief and functionality. Each metric is reviewed based on hands‑on use, expert commentary and practical day‑to‑day wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this MyCelsius bracelet review, I wore it daily across a four‑week period, at home, away from home and over some nights too, tracking the onset, duration and relief of hot flushes, and pairing this with feedback from GP and Women’s Health Expert, Dr Lucie Ormerod, and endocrinologist, Dr Mark Vanderpump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra checks included wearing the bracelet during a light workout and going from warm to cold environments to test real‑world responsiveness. Our aim is to deliver an independent, transparent verdict so that you can decide whether this device is suitable for you and worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why you can trust Telegraph Recommend&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our thorough, real-world tests will always help you find the best product.

We are fine with that but are not looking to make it a larger group and I am definitely not looking to turn into the “cruise director” for the group as often seems to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IHFFPISC6ZE4TJXU5VR47BTTHY"&gt;There is one friend that we feel is going to be very upset when she finds out about the cruise and feel personally excluded.

It’s perfectly fine for a subset of a friend group to decide to do something that doesn’t necessarily involve the rest of the group. Bruised feelings might occur, but this isn’t in and of itself a betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KXGFXU5PB5FYTIOA2NSWKQSIEY"&gt;But you’ve purposefully been trying to exclude this one friend, something that she might correctly infer should she find out about the trip through social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6YTGXEDSHJH3LOSCI5QHWJQQOM"&gt;This is your right, of course, but you have to own your choices. To that end, think about what you personally desire from this friendship. It won’t help you to speak for the group – and hearing “we all think this…” never feels great. But you have an individual connection to this friend that may or may not be damaged by the group’s decision. Let that connection guide your actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6HW6VNI3KRHZFCPQQACIAJLTBA"&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Send questions to R.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrambled eggs are high in protein and will have little impact on blood sugar response. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oatmeal contains fiber and your blood sugar response may depend on the type of oats you choose. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both are healthy breakfast options; pairings and mix-ins will impact how your body responds. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re trying to keep your blood sugar steady, what you choose for breakfast matters and two of the most popular options couldn’t be more different. Here, we’re putting Team Savory and Team Sweet in a head-to-head breakfast showdown. In one corner: scrambled eggs, the savory protein-packed powerhouse. In the other: oatmeal, the classic sweet staple. Next, dietitians break down how scrambled eggs and oatmeal impact blood sugar and which one might be the better pick for you. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Let’s start by cracking open eggs to see what’s inside. One-half a cup of whole scrambled eggs contains 164 calories, 12 g fat, 1.7 g of carbohydrates, 0 g fiber and 11 g protein.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Since scrambled eggs have very little carbohydrate and are made up mostly of protein and fat, they have very little impact on blood sugar on their own,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.jackietopol.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jackie Topol, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, specializing in pre-diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you cook with your eggs can make a difference. “Cooking eggs with butter or oil will increase the fat content, which can slow digestion and slow the rise in blood sugar further. Adding in vegetables, which contain fiber, will also help slow down how quickly blood sugar rises”, she adds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you pair with your eggs matters too. Eating them alongside a few slices of bread, cereal or a bowl of fruit may cause your blood sugar to rise. However, the protein and fat in eggs still helps slow digestion while also creating less of a rise in blood sugar levels and keeps you satiated longer too, explains &lt;a href="https://www.amysnutritionkitchen.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Kimberlain, MS, RDN, CDCES,&lt;/a&gt; a diabetes educator. Ultimately, we’re keeping eggs in the running in this breakfast showdown. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Warm, comforting and filling, a bowl of oats is a blank canvas for sweet and savory toppings. When peering inside the barrel of oats, one cup of cooked oats provides 182 calories, 6 g of fat, 27 g of carbs, 4 g of dietary fiber and 5 g of protein.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Oatmeal contains carbohydrates and will impact blood sugar levels when consumed.  Additionally, the type of oat, how it’s cooked and what you eat it with will impact how quickly it can raise your blood sugar,” explains Kimberlain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Topol breaks down the different varieties of oats: “Steel-cut oats are the least processed, highest in fiber and slowest to digest. They generally have the most gentle impact on blood sugar. Rolled oats are moderately processed and a good source of fiber; they typically provide a moderate rise in blood sugar. Instant oats are made up of ground oats, which are quickest to cook and also to digest, which can lead to a faster, sharper rise in blood glucose.”&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, it's important to note that all types of oats contain soluble fiber, which helps slow digestion and leads to fewer blood sugar spikes. Both experts emphasize that the portion size of oats and whether any added sugars are present will determine how much a person’s blood sugar may rise. Adding high-protein toppings like Greek yogurt or nuts, or extra fiber like berries or chia seeds, can help further slow down digestion and prevent blood sugar spikes, says Kimberlain.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-eggs-vs-oatmeal-which-is-better-for-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Eggs vs. Oatmeal: Which Is Better for Blood Sugar? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, when comparing the two head-to-head, what is the final verdict? The answer is: it depends. “Though eggs on their own may produce the smallest increase in blood sugar, without the addition of carbs, most people will be hungry pretty soon,” says Topol. That means you’ll likely pair eggs with something else for more sustenance - like toast, potatoes, fruits, veggies or a cup of juice - all of which can affect blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oatmeal, on the other hand, if prepared with both protein and fiber (ie. Greek-style yogurt and berries) and without added sugar, can provide sustained energy and lessen the blood sugar response, she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The ultimate verdict:  Aim for a breakfast that is balanced with protein, fiber and healthy fats, says Topol. Kimberlain agrees, and wants readers to remember: "Everyone's blood sugar response is different. Pay attention to how &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; body responds to different foods, not just eggs or oatmeal. Checking your blood sugar after meals can help you understand your own patterns and make choices that work best for you.”&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you break out your skillet - don’t forget to also include these items:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Veggies&lt;/strong&gt;: Saute any type of veggies with your scrambled eggs, such as dark leafy greens, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, broccoli or cauliflower.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Healthy Fat&lt;/strong&gt;: Include a source of healthy fat like avocado slices, a sprinkle of hemp seeds or a handful of walnuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Whole Grains or Starchy Veggies:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoy your eggs with a slice or two of whole wheat or sprouted bread, or build your own breakfast bowl by adding eggs to cooked grains such as farro or buckwheat or starchy veggies like a sweet potato or yam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Fruit:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoy eggs with a bowl of cut fruit or berries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dress up your blank canvas of oats with a plethora of toppings and mix-ins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make with Milk: &lt;/strong&gt;Make oats with dairy or soy milk, as it will naturally increase the protein and add other nutrients like calcium and vitamin D to the mix. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;Mix in Greek-style yogurt or cottage cheese for more protein and to dial up the creaminess. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Nuts or Seeds: &lt;/strong&gt;Sprinkle or stir in seeds like chia, flax or hemp for omega-3 fats, fiber and protein. Or add nuts like walnuts or pistachios or drizzle on some almond or peanut butter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Fruits: &lt;/strong&gt;Sweeten up your oats naturally by topping them with, or stirring in, any type of fruit. Kimberlain recommends raspberries or blackberries, which have the highest fiber and lowest sugar among fruits. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Savory Oats&lt;/strong&gt;: Whip up a batch of savory oats by topping it with eggs and veggies. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Steel-Cut or Rolled Oats: &lt;/strong&gt;Topol recommends choosing steel-cut or rolled oats as your best option for the least blood sugar spiking oatmeal option.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there wasn’t a clear winner in our scrambled eggs versus oatmeal blood sugar showdown, our experts agree that the better breakfast depends on several factors. For eggs, what you cook them with and what you eat them alongside can influence blood sugar. For oats, the portion size, type of oats and mix-ins play a role. To build a blood-sugar-friendly breakfast bowl, dietitians recommend including a balance of protein, fruits, veggies, healthy fats and whole grains to each plate.

&lt;p id="31433fd2-a8c2-4cef-a8cf-42c000d8ceea"&gt;What if a single blood test could determine whether you had one of 14 types of cancer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the question posed by a study published in November in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.70075" target="_blank" data-url="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.70075" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Conducted by researchers at the cancer detection-test company Exact Sciences, the paper models how cancer care for five million U.S. adults might be changed by easy access to blood tests designed to spot many cancers — known as multicancer early detection (MCED) liquid biopsy tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="31433fd2-a8c2-4cef-a8cf-42c000d8ceea-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The study suggests the tests could save lives by catching cancer at earlier stages, when it's more easily treated. It predicted that, over a decade of use, MCEDs could reduce stage IV cancer diagnoses in the U.S. by 45%, compared to the current standard-of-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1c1c5491-0d56-472d-bbe1-153c0eb6983c"&gt;But for now, liquid biopsies that test for multiple cancers still have unacceptably high false-positive rates. And even when they don't, there aren't clear guidelines for how to integrate them into the standard-of-care. That means they aren't going to make their way into the clinic in the near term, experts told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the transformative effect predicted by the Cancer paper can be borne out, doctors will need to figure out how to best use these tests in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-51aefc96-d0b2-4820-9abc-d4447d6575ce" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-pitch-for-liquid-biopsy-3"&gt;The pitch for liquid biopsy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="8b579450-fa8d-482c-9fec-ecd96981f174"&gt;The idea behind liquid biopsy tests is that they enable clinicians to look for cancer without going anywhere near the tumor itself, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolina-reduzzi/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolina-reduzzi/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Carolina Reduzzi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist and director of the liquid-biopsy platform at Weill Cornell Medicine, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like translating a tissue biopsy into the blood," said Reduzzi, who was not involved in the Cancer report.

Additionally, the hope is that if clinicians regularly repeat liquid biopsies, they could build up a picture of how a tumor changes in response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient's tumors contain many genetically distinct cells, tissue biopsies that only sample one portion of the tissue may provide a biased view of their disease, said Reduzzi. Liquid biopsy, in contrast, should provide a broader picture of a patient's cancer by making it easier to analyze cells from multiple tumor sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2f8e873a-e9aa-4c47-9b39-3181da9a0f1c" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-tests-are-in-use-now-3"&gt;Which tests are in use now? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a69643c1-d294-47fd-9dce-23613298be50"&gt;To date, the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics/list-cleared-or-approved-companion-diagnostic-devices-in-vitro-and-imaging-tools" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics/list-cleared-or-approved-companion-diagnostic-devices-in-vitro-and-imaging-tools" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; five liquid biopsy diagnostic tests, each for single types of cancer. These tests have been validated via assays that compared their ability to detect signs of cancer against tests that sample tumor tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No MCED tests are currently approved or available through routine clinical care, although some, like Exact's Cancerguard and GRAIL's Galleri, are available in the United States as "laboratory-developed tests" (LDTs).

The U.K.'s National Health Service is conducting a trial of Galleri, called PATHFINDER 2, based on data from 140,000 participants. That data will be released next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browne and Reduzzi noted that inertia in the field of oncology could delay the further rollout of liquid biopsies. Oncologists have, for decades, built diagnostic and treatment plans based on data from tissue-biopsy analyses. Shaking these entrenched practices, even with data showing the utility of liquid biopsies, is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with single-cancer tests, Browne says that standardization is an issue. "Everyone is using a different assay," so making head-to-head comparisons to decide which test is best can be confusing. Different trials have been analyzing different markers of cancer, at various timepoints in disease progression, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="634fcace-2f61-46f6-8800-98f6a97aaecc"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Liquid biopsies look for signs of cancer — such as whole tumor cells, fragments of tumor cells, and free-floating tumor DNA — in the blood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: CIPhotos/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-fdb59867-f9db-411e-b244-f6ee354c0287" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="less-optimistic-predictions-3"&gt;'Less optimistic' predictions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="ee514d7b-4dc2-46de-962b-b81a517a9c40"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/etzioni-ruth.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/etzioni-ruth.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ruth Etzioni&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a biostatistician at Fred Hutch cancer center in Seattle, leads a multi-institute effort to review emerging cancer treatment and diagnostics. Similar to the Cancer report, Etzioni's team has modeled the impact of MCEDs and predicts that they would allow cancers to be detected at earlier stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she added, "our numbers are a little less optimistic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests' helpfulness varies by cancer type, because it hinges on how long different cancers remain in each stage of progression. If a cancer lingers longer in stage I and II, then MCED tests would be well-placed to diagnose it early. But if a cancer rapidly progresses to stage IV, then the test will be less useful, Etzoni explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question of how long different cancers stay in each stage is still a matter of debate. The "dwell times" used in the recent Cancer report leaned more optimistic, assuming that cancers would progress slowly enough for an annual MDEC test to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason MCED tests are not ready to replace existing diagnostics is that some analyses will always require a tissue biopsy, and current medical guidelines advise doctors to make some clinical decisions based on tumor-tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="899858ba-1185-4aca-b546-25d63b3d4387"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't think we have a test that is there.

"You cannot get that in the blood." All the researchers interviewed for this article agreed that a positive on a liquid biopsy test would need to be followed up with further testing before any cancer treatment was initiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, multicancer tests may diagnose cancer earlier, but whether that early diagnosis will lead to lower death rates will depend on whether those confirmation tests happen quickly, Etzioni said. And those follow-up tests also have to be up to the task of identifying early-stage cancer, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-645ca3e0-b784-4b5b-8c2c-e626110456b9" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="fixing-false-positives-3"&gt;Fixing false positives &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="bf702886-e0c6-44c6-aa5e-1909961609f5"&gt;Emerging MCEDs also have issues with false positives, Browne said. Early, non-peer reviewed data from the PATHFINDER 2 trial shows that Galleri was extremely good at identifying people without cancer — correctly identifying people without the disease 99.6% of the time. But meanwhile, roughly 40% of the patients that the test diagnosed with cancer were actually cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A false-positive rate of that magnitude puts unnecessary worry on the patient, said Browne, and each false-positive could trigger follow-up tests that people would not have gotten otherwise. If scaled up to the millions of people at elevated risk of cancer, it would significantly burden any health system that adopted the tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce false-positive rates, future studies will need to find more reliable signals of cancer to detect. Detecting information from other cell types, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/85/8_Supplement_2/LB254/761677" target="_blank" data-url="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/85/8_Supplement_2/LB254/761677" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;like immune cells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has been shown to improve test specificity. Improvements to laboratory standardization could also help cut the false-positive rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ce17fe5b-6b67-4cf6-9026-2fa8bc6d709f"&gt;Browne hopes that liquid biopsy could someday help patients avoid the sapping side effects that were once unavoidable parts of cancer treatment. For instance, an ongoing trial at the Royal Marsden Hospital is assessing whether a test could identify breast cancer patients who don't need post-operative chemotherapy. The test enables the doctors to assess a patient's risk even after their tumor has been removed because it looks for tumor DNA in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduzzi believes that optimized multicancer tests — which would identify a large fraction of people who have cancer while having a low false-positive rate — will transform cancer diagnostics, and that such tests are on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we have a test that is there," she said. "But I think we will. With time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="01f3d76f-ed7b-4cc1-baee-a9af6db70401"&gt;

One of her friends, “Callie,” has an innocent but obvious crush on my husband, “Josh.” Callie does a lot of clumsy teen flirting and he either ignores it or shuts it down politely. If she’s around, he makes himself scarce. Our daughter teases Callie about it and tells her it’s weird, but it hasn’t stopped. And there’s a particular reason that Josh is so uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now our approach is that I do all the supervising the girls, including carpool drives, pickups, and dropoffs, when Callie is involved, and Josh steers clear.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s worried about just the appearance of inappropriate behavior if she’s flirting with him. Josh begged me to help him deal with this situation. He suggested she not be allowed at our house anymore, and he wants to skip our daughter’s games for the rest of the season since Callie is also on the team. He suggested we talk to her parents. He suggested I (!!) talk to Callie about romantic safety and the risks to minors. This all seems like overkill, but maybe I’m just not taking this seriously enough? I want to keep everyone in this situation safe and well, but not go too far.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="196" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjef21al000n3b7ae2dzhftx@published"&gt;It may seem like “overkill,” but Callie’s behavior is triggering to your husband and it makes sense that he’s willing to do whatever it takes to avoid her. I would start with talking to her parents; while a talk from you could be helpful, it would be more appropriate for her own folks to have that discussion with her. For most teens, the humiliation of having her crush (and her behavior) shared with her parents should be enough to put a stop to her flirting. If she persists, then it would be fair to stop allowing her to come to the house; it’s not ideal for your husband to miss your daughter’s games, but if he needs to, try and be understanding—this situation has brought him back to one of the most traumatic times in his life. If you end up having to take one of these measures, you should talk to your daughter about what her dad experienced (he can decide how much he’d like to share) and the importance of behaving appropriately with adults. However, I suspect that Callie will get it together once her parents are made aware of how she’s been acting.&lt;/p&gt;

My wife and I are both pretty strongly averse to social media. We’ve therefore blocked all the major social media services at our homes.

A 6-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/unvaccinated-boy-almost-died-tetanus-hospital-bill-was-more-800-n981256" target="_blank"&gt;unvaccinated boy in Oregon&lt;/a&gt; racked up almost $1 million in medical bills after he contracted tetanus in 2019, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb11cd" class="body-graf"&gt;Rathore compared the cost of vaccines to the cost of intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f9aac" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not even pennies to dollars; it’s pennies to hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Rathore said. “It’s very expensive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74be7c" class="body-graf"&gt;When a 9-year-old unvaccinated patient came to Rathore with muscle spasm in Florida this year, he recognized the signs. He remembered the tetanus wards from his medical school days where patients were cared for in dark and silent isolation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe29b0" class="body-graf"&gt;“The slightest noise would cause many of these patients to go into spasm,” Rathore said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c55b43" class="body-graf"&gt;Tetanus spasms, which can also be triggered by light (known as “photophobia”), are extremely painful and can constrict the muscles around the airway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-adb10b" class="body-graf"&gt;Amid the bright lights, loud noises and incessant beeping of the hospital’s intensive care unit, the options were limited for minimizing stimulation for Rathore's young patient. The 9-year-old was sedated, intubated and given tetanus immune globulin antibodies and the vaccine to reduce future risk of disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d45a0" class="body-graf"&gt;The child was hospitalized for 37 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7013b7" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Matthew Davis, enterprise physician-in-chief and chief scientific officer at Nemours Children’s Health in Florida and Delaware, said that “it wasn’t until we had widespread vaccination that we saw a decline in cases of tetanus and thereby a reduction in the risk of mortality from it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e939a" class="body-graf"&gt;John Johnson, a vaccination and epidemic response adviser at Doctors Without Borders, works in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where tetanus remains a concern. Last year, there were 540 cases in the DRC, &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/tetanus-reported-cases-and-incidence?CODE=COD&amp;amp;DISEASE=TTETANUS&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-013172" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s one of those things that’s so stupidly easy to prevent,” Johnson said. “If you see one case of tetanus in the U.S., it’s a shame. There’s no reason we should be seeing this disease anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-93be9d" class="body-heading"&gt;'My jaw was completely locked shut'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db2b3f" class="body-graf"&gt;After the initial series in childhood, a booster dose is recommended every 10 years for adults, although many are unaware of the need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73689d" class="body-graf"&gt;Nikki Arellano, 42, hadn't had a tetanus shot since 2010 when she was injured while she was helping her friend set up for a wedding last month. An accident with a metal arch at the altar led to a minor cut on her leg. The following week, she found it difficult to chew during lunch at work because of pain in her jaw. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8af84a" class="body-graf"&gt;Two days later, she couldn’t open her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-170eb8" class="body-graf"&gt;“My jaw was completely locked shut,” said Arellano, of Reno, Nevada. “I went to the ER, and they tried to give me a bunch of sedatives and pain medicine and muscle relaxers to get my jaw to open, and nothing was making it open.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a1d3d" class="body-graf"&gt;Arellano was diagnosed with tetanus and admitted to the hospital. She was connected to an intravenous pump so she could get antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f7f34" class="body-graf"&gt;“Every time that it would run out, it was like a really, really loud beeping noise. When that started is when my muscle contractions would pop off,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b39f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Arellano said her spasms initially started in one arm, then progressed to both arms and then to full body spasms. “It would arch your back really bad, like, it was really, really painful muscle spasms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-781b05" class="body-graf"&gt;Arellano began to have difficulty swallowing, prompting worries that her airway might become compromised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c3539" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was very scary,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-09781e" class="body-graf"&gt;She was hospitalized for nearly a week and is still recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-db35be" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heightened risk with climate change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a3a276" class="body-graf"&gt;Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and floods are known risk factors for tetanus outbreaks. As people rummage through the wreckage, they are also likelier to be injured by loose nails or broken shards of glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-153105" class="body-graf"&gt;“As the Earth warms, there’s already a documented increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of many extreme weather and climate events,” said Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist and professor of global health at the University of Washington who studies the health effects of climate change. “And as there are more flooding events, then fewer vaccinations for diseases like tetanus means that people would be at greater risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15b0b6" class="body-graf"&gt;Some states that are at highest risk of significant natural disasters, including Florida, Texas and Kansas, are recording notable declines in tetanus vaccination, according to NBC News data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQeDYwZHdfd0N6ZlFZdkI4QVJ2SEZESVo1U250Nl81QmdLVlV6YzBwM2xmWnBxNk9KaWcxWTg4V1RpbmlqZWF0OGRpV3RfRGxxNVBMTHBEaktpZzFzX1NEbE1xaXljNFR4Tng2T1p1SmRkRmRXWGx5TnBFT1RNSmZrbGoyeV9KTXcxN3A2WFJyVmZUemxuQUxiY3UtdjdkNmVIbjdueWZ1bkNaem5lYnJlU9IBVkFVX3lxTE1ZUHpsNXRJTHNVQXhOMUl0T1FpSGFMaThoLWJFbF92aGozWnA3a19VczFiRnBnSHhCNVV1am5IdlEzaGNJVXFWRmdTRDJtX2VDZThITlh3</guid></item><item><title>减肥药物结束了他们的性生活。它会反弹吗？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/well/weight-loss-drugs-ended-their-sex-life-could-it-bounce-back.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:00:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOLTFncnVEUVFvZ0VJZ084ZHhLWVpOeWE1QWY0OTVSR3FkNDVJaFB2ZmhudVNQd1A5VTRKTkNEV2JvdG9NRkNEWDFwWEs3Nm9UOW5UWFZWOERxR19FdkRSNVp0TVNiTGVBaU9UNS0tMDV4TWRyX2dvdGNCTnRyVEhBSHZZYWNZaE5vMi1Gd3JBcm9BVTFaRnhjc0NfcmxQdllMOUNnNG05VQ</guid></item><item><title>今年假期，明尼苏达州的流感病例激增。如何保护自己- MPR新闻</title><link>https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/12/24/flu-cases-surge-how-to-protect-yourself</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Auth_supplementalText__LpEPr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By submitting, you consent that you are at least 18 years of age and to receive information about MPR's or APMG entities' programs and offerings.

                                &lt;p&gt;Life-saving cancer medication in Trinidad and Tobago can cost close to $40,000 a month, a reality that cancer survivor Nicole Dyer-Griffith has described as “untenable” and one that leaves many patients with little choice but to go without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyer-Griffith made the disclosure on Saturday during the soft launch of the Healing Hub Patient Navigation and Advocacy Centre at her home in Moka, Maraval, where she spoke candidly about the financial, emotional and psychological toll of managing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I picked up the phone and I asked a big Pharma company what was the cost of the drugs for me to take,” she said. “And when they told me the cost of these drugs, that was the one time I felt defeated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She revealed that the monthly cost of therapy following multiple rounds of treatment was beyond the reach of most families. “How is somebody able to access $40,000 a month to purchase medication that keeps you alive?” she asked. “How is that possible?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyer-Griffith said she was told bluntly that many patients simply cannot afford the drugs they need. “Many can’t and many don’t,” she said. “And it’s too much for the government to subsidise. So sometimes people just die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former senator and social advocate, who was first diagnosed with stage three breast cancer and later with stage four brain cancer, said the experience laid bare a systemic failure in patient support and advocacy. While she credited her survival to a strong personal network and medical team, she acknowledged that not everyone has access to the same resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I manage it because I have a group of angels around me,” she said, explaining that her support system helped her navigate treatment, sourcing medication and emotional care. “We get it done every single month.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That reality, she said, was the driving force behind the creation of the Healing Hub, which began as a tightly moderated WhatsApp support group and has since grown into a broader advocacy initiative with about 160 active members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So many people were reaching out,” she said. “It just became overwhelming—thousands of messages across a number of platforms—people wanting to talk, wanting information, wanting support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hub, she explained, was created to provide patients with credible, science-based information while also offering emotional support from people with lived experience. “The Healing Hub was developed and I think has filled that gap quite successfully,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyer-Griffith stressed that the Hub is not designed to replace medical professionals, but to empower patients to better understand their diagnosis and treatment options. “That is what healthcare is about,” she said. “Providing information, allowing people to ask questions and challenge interpretations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She described the period following a cancer diagnosis as an “emotional vortex”, marked by fear, confusion and an overload of often conflicting advice. “If you do not protect your mentals, then that emotional vortex will be very difficult to climb out of,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed Healing Hub Patient Navigation and Advocacy Centre aims to formalise that support by offering trained patient navigators who can help individuals and families move through the healthcare system, understand treatment pathways and access support services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyer-Griffith said she hopes to establish a physical centre by 2026 at a cost of about $2 million. The facility, she said, would be free of charge to patients and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has to be free of charge for persons in Trinidad and Tobago,” she stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that similar patient advocacy models already exist internationally and could be adapted locally. “If this can be done elsewhere, why can’t we do it at home?” she asked rhetorically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond individual patient care, Dyer-Griffith placed the initiative within a wider public health context, noting that Trinidad and Tobago’s leading causes of death remain diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It stands to reason that we invest more in looking at the management and advocacy of these top three,” she said, pointing out that early intervention and patient support could reduce long-term healthcare costs and improve life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her remarks, she also called on pharmaceutical companies to play a greater role in supporting patients, particularly given the high cost of medication. “Where is your sense of corporate social responsibility?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She welcomed recent statements by the Government indicating it would examine the cost of medication and price gouging, describing that move as “a step in the right direction”, but said more tangible action was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to do more,” she said. “We need to continue to advocate more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Healing Hub, she added, is ultimately about dignity and humanity in healthcare. “If you are not placed on this earth to positively impact the lives of people, then what’s the point?” she said. “That is one of the reasons for my purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full public launch of the Healing Hub Patient Navigation and Advocacy Centre is expected next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now, experts dealing with his necroscopy have revealed what ultimately led to the giant's demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 5.5-metre (nearly 18-foot) saltwater crocodile &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/rip-cassius-worlds-largest-captive-crocodile-dies-at-approximately-110-years-old-76633" target="_blank"&gt;died in November 2024&lt;/a&gt; at the Marineland Melanesia wildlife park on Green Island off the coast of Cairns, where he had been housed for four decades. At the grand age of around 110-120, he was one of the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/at-123-years-old-henry-is-the-worlds-oldest-known-crocodile-and-hes-an-absolute-unit-76112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;oldest known crocodiles&lt;/a&gt; in captivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, the world-famous reptile had been given the all-clear just a few weeks before his death by veterinarians, who noted he appeared "bright, alert and happy". Then, out of the blue, he passed away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-12/world-record-crocodile-cassius-taxidermied-new-exhibit/106131178" target="_blank"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;, the Darwin-based Centre for Crocodile Research says its necropsy revealed that Cassius died of an infection related to an injury he had suffered in the wild more than 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injury triggered an infection that became sealed inside a tough fibrous capsule, lying dormant for decades. Over time, that protective bubble broke down and eventually ruptured, allowing the infection to swarm through the crocodile’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sally Isberg, Managing Director at the Centre for Crocodile Research, told the media outlet that while so-called fibriscesses are “well-documented” in crocodiles, Cassius’ case was extraordinary due to how long the infection was contained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With further snooping, the team concluded that the hidden infection may have been linked to an injury sustained in the 1980s when Cassius was struck by a boat propeller, resulting in the loss of his front left leg, part of his snout, and the end of his tail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we didn't know was that the rib cage had also been damaged in that injury," said Dr Isberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reason was that everything was perfectly healed — there were no signs of infection or recent scarring. Upon necropsy, his left rib was distended compared to his right one, so longer," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a perfect example of the effect of old age — he was no longer able to continue that fibrous casing around that infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-FTIeYNvQpQ?&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassius was captured in 1984 in the Finniss River near Darwin and transported by road and boat, eventually arriving at Marineland Melanesia in 1987. Owing to his size and power, he was named after Cassius Clay, the birth name of boxer Muhammad Ali.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was recognized as the world’s largest captive crocodile for some time, according to &lt;a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2023/8/largest-crocodile-cassius-went-from-terrifying-predator-to-dreamy-eyed-dad-756676" target="_blank"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt;, although the title was snatched by an &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/at-62-meters-lolong-was-the-largest-crocodile-ever-recorded-and-captured-80905" target="_blank"&gt;even larger individual called Lolong&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the legacy of Cassisu lives on. The taxidermied body of the Aussie beast (still missing its left leg and tail tip) has just arrived home to Marineland Melanesia, where it is now on display at a new exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:17:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNaWkxWmJIcUVVeG41Yi1FSktvWGxNLUNTZWVnQlQteDJmUVVWcG1yU2hyOXYxYWdkQ042S0RHZmFuZ3piYTY5d2NGY3NCdzUxcWZiLXpHRVBXRVRTdlNQc0RIS0c5WElNRFQwZHhheTJvRzc1TlQweDYtVloyY2NoT2poU245bTlGVWVTMl90aWFVb1JzUVFqenpIWmg5Q0pwWVV4OGo2cmR2QkdEX0xrYmpoblJCS0xZWEdoS0l1YWFfUQ</guid></item><item><title>如果我感染HPV ，我是否更容易患宫颈癌？ -《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/hpv-nhs-screening-b2890006.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gIQPHK sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iBibVd"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 jVZWGn"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eZqxmv"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 tawua"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 gZmYS"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 iCTyfe"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

You can have sex once and get HPV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which types of HPV can increase your risk of cervical cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are over 200 types of HPV, according to &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://eveappeal.org.uk/resource/hpv/"&gt;The Eve Appeal&lt;/a&gt;, and they are split into two groups: low-risk HPV and high-risk HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 14 types of HPV are considered high risk for cervical cancer and two of these types (HPV 16 and HPV 18) cause about 70 out of 100 (70%) of all cervical cancer cases, according to &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cervical-cancer/risks-causes"&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HPV 16 and HPV 18 can infect the cervix, and if the infection persists then they can increase the risk of cervical cancer,” explains Olaitan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you find out if you have HPV?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are usually no symptoms of HPV, so if you don’t go to a cervical cancer screening, you won’t know you have it,” says Olaitan. “The knowledge of whether you have HPV or not is only important because it marks people out as having a greater risk of having abnormal cells, which if left undetected or untreated can increase the risk of cervical cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone with a cervix should be invited for screening by the &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; every five years from the age 25 to 64, according to the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/cervical-screening/what-is-cervical-screening/"&gt;NHS website&lt;/a&gt;. It also states that during the screening appointment, a small sample of cells is taken from your cervix and the sample is checked for high-risk HPV types that can cause changes to the cells of your cervix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the initial screening finds high-risk HPV, a reflex cytology test would be conducted on the same sample to look for abnormal cells,” explains Olaitan. “If that finds no abnormal cells, you will be told to come back for a screening at a shorter interval. However, if abnormal cells are found you will be referred for a colposcopy to have a closer look at the cervix.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can protect yourself against HPV?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The HPV vaccine is very effective at protecting people against HPV,” says Olaitan. “It’s typically given to children between the ages of 11 and 13 and is licensed to the age of 45, but it’s less effective the older you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But you can have it even if you’ve been exposed to HPV or you have a current HPV infection, and it gives immunity that’s stronger and longer lasting than natural immunity alone. So, it’s still good to have it, but it’s better to have it when you’re young.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some symptoms of cervical cancer to look out for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most common symptoms of cervical cancer are bleeding after sex, bleeding in between periods, bleeding after the menopause, or an offensive, persistent vagina discharge,” highlights Olaitan. “Most of the time these symptoms are indicative of benign conditions, but it’s important that they’re not ignored and that you go and get them checked to exclude anything more serious going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the most important thing people should know about HPV and cervical cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Remember that cervical cancer is preventable, and people who go for regular screenings are unlikely to get cancer,” says Olaitan. “&lt;a href="/topic/screening"&gt;Screening&lt;/a&gt; and being vaccinated are two of the most important things you can do for your health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQT2RfMlZad0k0ejVuOVgyd2REanVRZ25wR0MwWmVJcm9MWW1EWTc4dlh5aEJQaGpMNVRpb0NsMVFHeXBnYklOUl9VdjQtZ2xZYlM1VG5nMHE2QlhSVnNobzUwM0VieWh4WTNZeGRtX25lZEZpOU1mZUQ5bThZdFRoSWpqbkxLNWU4NGdtMU5ER3RIcmotVThz</guid></item><item><title>询问Eric ：我们是否应该向消极的朋友坦白我们为什么不邀请她参加邮轮假期？ - OregonLive.com</title><link>https://www.oregonlive.com/advice/2025/12/asking-eric-do-we-owe-it-to-negative-friend-to-come-clean-about-why-we-didnt-invite-her-on-cruise-vacation.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CNI3I3G6MJG6RBRBMBUCZROQMQ"&gt;Dear Eric: Three friends and I are planning an eight-day cruise in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ARYGFESISNDALHRN4JBMV3UPLM"&gt;Two other people found out about the trip and are now coming as well. We are fine with that but are not looking to make it a larger group and I am definitely not looking to turn into the “cruise director” for the group as often seems to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HS722EYOERH3HN24CBEJB44YVA"&gt;There is one friend that we feel is going to be very upset when she finds out about the cruise and feel personally excluded.

Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NVNTGTED4RGPNJHE7LLCDCUIRU"&gt;– Anxious Cruiser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZTDXMCT5SNFTJCXFXGUK47GSFA"&gt;Dear Cruiser: I’d be inclined to suggest you say nothing if it weren’t for the sticky issue of the truth. It’s perfectly fine for a subset of a friend group to decide to do something that doesn’t necessarily involve the rest of the group. Bruised feelings might occur, but this isn’t in and of itself a betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WQY42BG375APRLC3CIEHHQSNNU"&gt;But you’ve purposefully been trying to exclude this one friend, something that she might correctly infer should she find out about the trip through social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RFYZVSUBOFHOFFNRHDYHZTMP3Y"&gt;This is your right, of course, but you have to own your choices. To that end, think about what you personally desire from this friendship. It won’t help you to speak for the group – and hearing “we all think this…” never feels great. But you have an individual connection to this friend that may or may not be damaged by the group’s decision. Let that connection guide your actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:ADCNGOTLAVGNHLEY2AEXIUJJY4" data-fusion-component="ADCNGOTLAVGNHLEY2AEXIUJJY4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:ADCNGOTLAVGNHLEY2AEXIUJJY4" data-fusion-component="ADCNGOTLAVGNHLEY2AEXIUJJY4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5IHP6IFRNBEJZBVX5C7GIO562M"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Send questions to R.

Inflammation can lead to cardiac events by constricting and damaging blood vessels, as well as promoting the formation of dangerous plaque buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, orange juice upregulated – promoted – the activity of genes responsible for metabolizing fat, helping the body process and store it more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found two body-type-dependent effects. Fat metabolism was particularly optimized by orange juice in people with overweight. People of normal weight saw a greater reduction in systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s first author, &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Layanne-Fraga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Layanne Nascimento Fraga&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, of the Food Research Center and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo in Brazil, explained the study’s novel perspective on orange juice to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s unique about our study,” said Nascimento Fraga, “is that we used the transcriptomic approach to evaluate the effects of orange juice on the entire metabolic system, allowing us to see how multiple pathways are modulated simultaneously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We found that orange juice improves key cardiometabolic markers, including inflammation, oxidative stress, blood pressure, and lipid metabolism, showing that several mechanisms act together to produce its health benefits.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After factoring for duplicates, the researchers found 1,705 differentially expressed genes affected by orange juice in this study, 98% of which were downregulated, according to Fraga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a preventive cardiology dietitian at Entirely Nourished, who was not involved in this research, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that, prior to this study, “other &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7987641/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; and meta-analyses showed modest reductions in systolic and diastolic &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327077" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in adults with pre- or stage 1 hypertension.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This is because orange juice, especially after meals, increases plasma hesperetin, which is a flavonoid that may improve endothelial function and microvascular reactivity,” Routhenstein explained.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.joinmidi.com/team/jayne-morgan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jayne Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, MD, cardiologist and Vice President of Medical Affairs at Hello Heart, likewise not involved in this study, said that other foods hold promise for cardiovascular health, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan advised that “anti-inflammatory spices and herbs — such as turmeric and garlic — chia, hemp seeds, beets, and beet juice” might also benefit from similar molecular investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, also not involved in this research, commented on the study’s investigative approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting, but I’m more interested in how this connects to outcomes,” Chen told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expressed some doubt regarding the meaning of orange juice’s heart-health benefits when viewed from a molecular angle, since, “from a clinician’s perspective, it’s easy enough to measure blood pressure.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can also measure lipids easily enough” in a clinical trial, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything in moderation, including orange juice,” Morgan advised people who may now feel tempted to up their orange juice intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Orange juice likely has a U-shaped curve, wherein small–moderate amounts are likely helpful for improved endothelial function, decreased arterial stiffness, and mild-anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects from the citrus flavonoid. And blood pressure health from the potassium. Most Americans are actually potassium-deficient, so orange juice is helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Jayne Morgan, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan cautioned, however, that “larger amounts [of vitamin C] drive increased sugar loads and all of the risks inherent, such as insulin spikes, weight gain, and visceral fat, especially in perimenopausal and menopausal women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always recommend to my patients that they eat lots of fruit, including &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/272782" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;oranges&lt;/a&gt;, though I don’t say they should drink juices so much. When you extract juices, you leave behind things like fiber. Fiber helps even out the sudden release of sugar from juices,” Chen also advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t recommended orange juice specifically,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routhenstein suggested “further studying whole fruits, including the fiber-rich membranes and the white, spongy albedo, which is high in fiber and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/flavanoids" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, could clarify how the fruit matrix influences bioavailability and gene responses compared with juice alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many whole foods,” said Routhenstein, “provide similar multi-target cardiovascular support because they, too, deliver synergistic combinations of nutrients and bioactive compounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This would include &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270272" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;,” noted Morgan, “as milk chocolate is actually the processed form of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/dark-chocolate" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/green-leafy-vegetables" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/a&gt; supply nitrate, magnesium, and carotenoids that improve endothelial function and support healthy blood pressure,” added Routhenstein. “&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-are-legumes" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Legumes&lt;/a&gt; provide viscous fiber, plant protein, potassium, and polyphenols that reduce &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ldl-cholesterol" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, stabilize blood sugar, and lower inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foods high in &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287212" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, said Morgan, “help keep your blood vessels and blood pressure healthy, such as oranges, bananas, spinach, beans, and potatoes.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Berries,” according to Routhenstein, “offer anthocyanins that enhance endothelial function and decrease oxidative stress, while nuts combine unsaturated fats, arginine, and polyphenols to improve lipid profiles and vascular tone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Make plants the majority of your palate and use extra virgin olive oil, and foods rich in &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325179" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;omega 3s&lt;/a&gt;,” said Morgan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also recommended lean protein, especially in &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/perimenopause" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317765" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, limiting both salt and alcohol, and avoiding canned soups, sauces, and deli meats when possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 06:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxORkRhcXoxZFdGeV9yQV9MVWJOTzMwOG85QVVrc0paTGZveFFHLVh4aVBUT0Y5c2tuU2xsajRuOHdxS1FVdGI5ZlEyMHdnVVBCRlVUX3JubndMTjN4RDI0dVZDN09adXpCVlY3aXJ4QXltVFRfOFhvMmI2V25RZ0hxM3RGQ00xNEpZY2dwN2RITQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
