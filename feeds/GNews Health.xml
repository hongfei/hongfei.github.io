His wife immediately called 911 and the 61-year-old was rushed to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Montalvo said: 'Everything started spinning. I went to stand up, and I fell. I just didn't understand what was going on. I couldn't understand it. I didn't know why I was feeling that way.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next thing he knew, the retired New York cop &lt;span&gt;woke up to the sound of concerned whispers from family and doctors, murmuring about a '15 percent percent chance of survival.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It turns out, Montalvo was having an ischemic stroke, which occurs when a clot restricts blood flow to the brain and deprives it of oxygen. This can lead to death or life-long disabilities, as stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the US. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Signs of an ischemic stroke - which account for 87 percent of all strokes - include some symptoms Montalvo was experiencing: sudden weakness or numbness, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, vision problems, severe headache, dizziness and loss of coordination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the US, someone has a stroke every 40 seconds - about 795,000 people a year - and every three minutes, a person dies from a stroke, the CDC reports. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montalvo added: 'I was like "Oh my God, I'm going to die. I don't even have a chance to say goodbye to anybody."' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nestor Montalvo (third from the right) suffered a stroke in September 2024 at 61 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When Montalvo was having a stroke, he thought: 'Oh my God, I'm going to die. I don't even have a chance to say goodbye to anybody'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a stroke occurs, 'time is brain,' Dr Taylor Kimberley, chief of neurocritical care at Massachusetts General Hospital, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/headache-stroke-recovery-rehabilitation-catholic-mercy-health/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;CBS. She was not involved in Montalvo's case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means the faster a person can receive treatment can make all the difference in avoiding brain damage. The longer a stroke goes untreated, the worse the damage can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Montalvo arrived at Catholic Health's Mercy Hospital in Nassau, Long Island, in September 2024, his symptoms immediately triggered a stroke protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once blood flow during a stroke is stopped, cells immediately start to die in major tissues, such as the cerebellum and brain stem, both of which regulate coordination and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Premier Neurology, anywhere from seven to 65 percent of people having a stroke will experience some form of a headache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In less than 10 minutes after arrival, Montalvo was assessed as a potential stroke patient, and five minutes later was hurried into a CT scan to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors then administered a clot-busting medication called TNK, and Montalvo underwent a minor procedure to ensure the clot had been broken up and would not reoccur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the initial procedure, Montalvo remained critical as his vocal chords stopped working and he underwent a tracheostomy - a surgery in which an opening is made in the throat and a tube is inserted to help with breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He couldn't talk or swallow for a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Montalvo underwent rigorous speech therapy to strengthen his throat in order to be able to speak again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the following six weeks, Montalvo underwent an hour of speech therapy a day and did exercises to strengthen muscles in the mouth and throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When his tracheostomy tube was finally removed, he underwent three more procedures to repair his throat and was eventually able to enjoy a Thanksgiving meal with his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, nearly a year later, life for Montalvo is returning somewhat back to normal, although he continues to use a cane to walk and have outpatient treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He hopes to further his progress, however, telling CBS that recovering was harder than getting through the stroke itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'You take life for granted, and then when something like this happens, it wakes you up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You hear people talk about it, and it just sounds like it's not going to happen to you. All of a sudden, it happens to you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The Fordham Tick Index, which monitors tick activity in southern New York, Connecticut and Northern New Jersey, currently rates the bite risk as "very high" – 9 out of 10 on its scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC reports that climate change may be contributing to the increasing numbers. In regions where Lyme disease is already present, milder winters result in fewer disease-carrying ticks dying during cold months, the agency notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to CDC data, May typically marks the annual peak for tick-bite emergencies. These rising numbers have prompted health officials to remind the public about the dangers posed by these tiny insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC warns that ticks can transmit various diseases through their bites, many of which share similar symptoms. Most people who visit emergency rooms report fever and chills, headaches, fatigue and muscle aches. Some patients also develop distinctive rashes, particularly those associated with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;With outdoor activities in full swing this summer, the CDC has issued several recommendations to prevent illness. The agency advises avoiding wooded and brushy areas with high grass and leaf litter, and staying in the center of trails when hiking. It also recommends using Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellents containing DEET, Picaridin, or other approved ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC recommends treating outdoor clothing and gear with permethrin, which remains effective even after multiple washes. Those planning to use both sunscreen and insect repellent should apply sunscreen first, followed by the repellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Health officials are also emphasizing that no area is immune to tick activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 19:18:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOTVMyQWpPOE1SdE1Md1BVSEZ3aDJFX2ZrUWJhQVM0cnZPZmNkRnRHd2lsRGtaM0kwTVJqMlNlbWk1VXNTeGlZOW9PSUVJSU5rSDhGaDNuWjU3dWtMVXBqN2M1UkdaaVhCSzhvdHVvNGNUSndodWhZX3FhS0pzSXlxcHZ4VmVySExPRWthQllkdzltbzJOTzhMRNIBngFBVV95cUxQN2paMjhTVk5SMG04MDBKa1RlYXVRTzBvT0p5REdrYzR2TFZKOHI3ZU1GM2U4bGMwb21Ya05IUWpxWUgyOHZnS2RQTVRpYTY4ZTJuNHdSWmljNk9ZcXpYRnFiN0VsUExmQjJJZTFOVFlWT2h0Y0Q5M0ZtQXZjTk1LMlBrbGlwMThnRU1MYllfaVo4MGxILXVFYnJVNDN2dw</guid></item><item><title>随着RFK Jr.追求反疫苗议程，麻疹病例达到33年来的最高水平- Ars Technica | Measles cases reach 33-year high as RFK Jr. pursues anti-vaccine agenda - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOTG5iLXVITHBsU3dvLVdrSktKZURBM2Y2RGNMM2ZhNmFpa2swRTY3NDItRG1KMlVfekQtSkxpTG53OHpxUUdZbUg4dVd2SW1xdG9yLTc5SjFkcjZBYzQ2NGk4eV9EdkpFY0xlV0pLcEZUckluaVpXV1k1SGRwNTdsc25KZ2pqazhicTdXU0tSS2lVYlBqVlRjQkstV2FBZlZKUHBYcXk2WTVSNlU3SzB3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Such is the case in Gaines County, Texas, where the largest outbreak this year has erupted. So far, that outbreak, which spans four states, accounts for at least 950 of the country's 1,281 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, overall, there have been a whopping 27 outbreaks in the country just in the first six months. According to national &lt;a href="https://campushealth.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2025-07/YSPH%20VMOC%20Special%20Report%20-%20Measles%20Outbreak%20%20Southwest%20US%207-6-2025.pdf"&gt;data compiled by researchers at Yale School of Public Health, as of July 6&lt;/a&gt;, the 1,281 cases are across 39 states, with around 90 percent of the cases associated with one of the outbreaks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reports a national measles case count but only updates its numbers on Wednesdays. According to the CDC's latest data, at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;155 people have been hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; for the infection, and three people have died—two otherwise healthy young children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico. All three deaths were in people who were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, most of the cases in the country are in unvaccinated children and teens. About 28 percent of cases are under the age of 5 and about 37 percent are ages 5 to 19. Of all the cases, 92 percent were in people who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have believed that inflammation inevitably increases with age, quietly fuelling diseases like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24833586/"&gt;heart disease, dementia and diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. But a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00888-0"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of Indigenous populations challenges that idea and could reshape how we think about ageing itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have identified chronic low-level inflammation – called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10911963/"&gt;"inflammaging"&lt;/a&gt; – as one of the primary drivers of age-related diseases. Think of it as your body's immune system stuck in overdrive – constantly fighting battles that don't exist, gradually wearing down organs and systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But inflammaging might not be a universal feature of ageing after all. Instead, it could be a byproduct of how we live in modern society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/nataging"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, compared patterns of inflammation in four very different communities around the world. Two groups were from modern, industrialised societies – older adults living in Italy and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Humans Age Faster at 2 Specific Times in Their Life, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other two were Indigenous communities who live more traditional lifestyles: the Tsimane people of the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli in the forests of Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed blood samples from more than 2,800 people, looking at a wide range of inflammatory molecules, known as cytokines. Their goal was to find out whether a pattern seen in earlier studies – where certain signs of inflammation rise with age and are linked to disease – also appears in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, it turns out, is both yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the Italian and Singaporean participants, the researchers found a fairly &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-319-99375-1"&gt;consistent inflammaging pattern&lt;/a&gt;. As people aged, levels of inflammatory markers in the blood, such as C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor, rose together. Higher levels were linked to a greater risk of chronic diseases including kidney disease and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the Tsimane and Orang Asli populations, the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33100820/"&gt;inflammaging pattern was absent&lt;/a&gt;. The same inflammatory molecules did not rise consistently with age, and they were not strongly linked to age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, among the Tsimane, who face high rates of infections from parasites and other pathogens, inflammation levels were often elevated. Yet this &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30752-3/abstract"&gt;did not&lt;/a&gt; lead to the same rates of chronic diseases that are common in industrialised nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite high inflammatory markers, the Tsimane experience very low rates of conditions such as heart disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166946" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inflammaging may not be universal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results raise important questions. One possibility is that inflammaging, at least as measured through these blood signals, is not a universal biological feature of ageing. Instead, it may arise in societies marked by high-calorie diets, low physical activity and reduced exposure to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166953" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166953" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642.jpg" alt="burgers and chips" class="wp-image-166953 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166953" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;High calorie, western-style diets could be responsible for aging-related inflammation. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADFEZbXxU4/"&gt;ksenee/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, chronic inflammation linked to ageing and disease might not simply result from an inevitable biological process, but rather from a mismatch between our ancient physiology and the modern environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that in communities with more traditional lifestyles – where people are more active, eat differently and are exposed to more infections – the immune system may work in a different way. In these groups, higher levels of inflammation might be a normal, healthy response to their environment, rather than a sign that the body is breaking down with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that inflammaging may still occur in all humans, but it might appear in different ways that are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35246947/"&gt;not captured by measuring inflammatory molecules&lt;/a&gt; in the blood. It could be happening at a cellular or tissue level, where it remains invisible to the blood tests used in this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these findings are confirmed, they could have significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they challenge how we diagnose and treat chronic inflammation in ageing. Biomarkers used to define inflammaging in European or Asian populations might not apply in other settings, or even among all groups within industrialised nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166956" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166956" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642.jpg" alt="elderly thai man" class="wp-image-166956 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166956" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Biomarkers the define aging in some populations might not apply to others. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFEPL3pTdA/"&gt;Sorapong's Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, they suggest that lifestyle interventions aimed at lowering chronic inflammation, such as exercise, changes in diet, or drugs targeting specific inflammatory molecules, might have different effects in different populations. What works for people living in cities might be unnecessary, or even ineffective, in those living traditional lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, this research serves as an important reminder that much of our knowledge about human health and ageing comes from studies conducted in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28429567/"&gt;wealthy, industrialised nations&lt;/a&gt;. Findings from these groups cannot automatically be assumed to apply worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are clear: this study is just the beginning. They urge scientists to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00082-y"&gt;dig deeper&lt;/a&gt;, using new tools that can detect inflammation not just in the blood, but within tissues and cells where the real story of ageing may be unfolding. Just as important, they call for more inclusive research that spans the full range of human experience, not just the wealthy, urbanised corners of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very least, this study offers an important lesson. What we thought was a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317232120"&gt;universal truth about the biology of ageing&lt;/a&gt; might instead be a local story, shaped by our environment, lifestyle and the way we live.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260322/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

At least three people have died from the illness, and 155 others were in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A vast majority of the measles cases - 92% - were in people who were either unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, according to the Centres for Disease Control (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The worst hit state is Texas, CDC data shows, where more than 700 cases have been reported. Other states with dozens of cases include Kansas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health officials say that measles spread is occurring mostly in neighbourhoods where vaccination rates are lower, such as Mennonite communities in Texas that opt out of modern medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The outbreak comes as anti-vaccine sentiment in the US and elsewhere has grown in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr had previously spread misinformation about childhood vaccinations and had minimised the outbreak. He later endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine as illness spread, saying in a post on X that it is "the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles cases in the US were at their highest in recent memory in 1990, with nearly 28,000 reported infections, according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The illness was later declared eliminated around the year 2000, when cases sharply declined to less than 90 thanks to high vaccination rates and rapid outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases started ticking up slightly in 2014 and again in 2019, when 1,274 confirmed infections were reported. But cases in 2025 have just surpassed that figure, with 1,277 infections now reported across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Public health experts have said that the US will lose measles elimination status if there is continued spread of measles at the current rate for more than 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As a result of the current outbreak, more people are now getting the measles vaccine in the US. Between 1 January and 16 March, Texas gave at least 173, 000 measles doses compared to 158,000 in the same time period last year, state health department data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Large measles outbreaks have been reported recently in other countries, including the UK. Last year marked the highest number of confirmed measles cases reported in England since 2012 at nearly 3,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since January of this year, there had been 529 cases reported in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Canada is also experiencing a measles outbreak, with more than 3,000 cases reported in 2025 so far. The bulk of the cases are in the provinces of Ontario and Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 18:54:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5jRU80MzNTbkd4R0xDd2EtX04tcHVnZE9XUjNjc0QxZGgtazFabGRha3l4Y0M4a1FWOFNQNm9YOTY2eTdhVkVQajJTaENac0dacVAxcjFDdXZMQdIBX0FVX3lxTFBscVNsSnlWc2ZELUl1UnhNVWdPSXdfQjNzNUdadFZ6MnFkb0VydllJQ1JiTVZLYlU3QlJacXdpZkVMSEhSeVRkSXk1eXQxYlMyQlhEN2ltLTgwMVdmUHow</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家分享了新的糖替代品， “不会使胰岛素水平飙升并降低体脂肪” -印度时报 | Cardiologist shares new sugar alternative that 'doesn't spike insulin levels and reduces body fat' - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, the only healthy alternatives to sugar have been known as stevia, truvia, monk fruit extract, coconut sugar, date sugar and more. All of these might be healthier for consumption than sugar but do have similar harmful effects on the body in lesser quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, an expert has shared a unique alternative to sugar that not only doesn't spike blood sugar and insulin levels but also reduces fat. Dr Alok Chopra, cardiologist and functional medicine expert defined the alternative as allulose, which is 70% as sweet as sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Allulose is a rare sugar alternative that doesn't spike blood sugar or insulin levels, making it a promising option for those managing diabetes or insulin resistance," shared the doctor on Instagram. Additionally, he added that 70% of allulose is absorbed in the blood and passes out in the urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the &lt;keyword id="27679104" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="benefits-of-allulose" source="keywords"&gt;benefits of allulose&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor even mentioned the benefits of consuming allulose:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Low calories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: With just 0.2-0.4 calories per gram, it consists of only 1/10th of the calories of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Vital for organs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: It is safe for vital organs such as the liver, kidneys and fat tissues and also reduces inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Healthy for blood-sugar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: With its low glycemic index, allulose improves insulin sensitivity and reduces post-meal glucose spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Increases energy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: Allulose not only boosts mitochondrial function but also improves endurance and protects the body against diabetic nephropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Improves metabolism and reduces fat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: Allulose also helps in fat burning, reduces body fat and enhances feelings of satiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the &lt;keyword id="27679102" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="natural-sources-of-allulose" source="keywords"&gt;natural sources of Allulose&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Confirmed cases appear to be the “tip of a much bigger iceberg”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000. However, as the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/29/childhood-immunisation-plummeted-pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;disrupted routine childhood visits&lt;/a&gt; to the doctors and anti-vaccine organizations saw their &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anti-vaccine-group-ican-del-bigtree-rfk-jr-nearly-doubled-revenue-rcna185214" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;coffers swell&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, measles vaccination rates have fallen below a critical threshold to prevent outbreaks in some communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As of 4 July, &lt;a href="https://cori.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/measles-outbreak-response" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Johns Hopkins University’s&lt;/a&gt; Center for Outbreak Response Innovation counted 1,277 measles cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; 1,267 cases, but has not updated its data since 2 July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The number of new cases has slowed down, but I don’t think there’s any reason to suggest this will be our last,” said Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and dean for the national school of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He later added: “It’s a very dark epidemic that never had to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The latest national tally will eclipse 2019, when unvaccinated members of New York City’s isolated orthodox Jewish community drove a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;large outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, and the nation ended the year with 1,274 confirmed measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Americans will need to look back to 1992 to find a higher annual measles tally. In 1992, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00020688.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; confirmed 2,126 cases, with the largest outbreaks in Kentucky and Texas. Texas has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;753 cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, according to the state health department, opening up the possibility that Texas could exceed the 1992 annual total as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The enormous outbreak comes as Donald Trump’s health secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, who once ran an influential anti-vaccine group, has injected upheaval into US vaccine policy and spread misinformation about treatments for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is a viral disease characterized by a top-down rash, high fever, runny nose and red, watery eyes. The virus is one of the most infectious diseases known to medicine. There is no cure for measles. The best way to prevent measles is by getting vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR), which is 97% effective with two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although most people recover, as many as one in five infected children require hospitalization; one in 20 get pneumonia and one in 1,000 can develop encephalitis, which can lead to lifelong disability, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The disease can also &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20found%20that%2C%20after,personal%20replies%20cannot%20be%20provided.)" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;weaken the host’s immune system&lt;/a&gt; and lead to more future infections. In rare cases, measles can cause an incurable &lt;a href="https://www.encephalitis.info/types-of-encephalitis/infectious-encephalitis/measles-infection-and-encephalitis/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;degenerative brain disorder&lt;/a&gt;. The US has already seen three deaths from measles this year, both in otherwise healthy children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Before a measles vaccine was licensed in 1963, an estimated 3-4 million Americans were sickened each year, 48,000 were hospitalized and an estimated 400-500 died, according to the CDC. From 1994 to 2023 in the US alone, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm#T2_down" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; the measles vaccine saved 85,000 lives and prevented 104m illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although the vaccine has been wildly successful, it has also been the target of sustained misinformation by people who have a financial stake in reduced vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 1998, a British doctor hypothesized a link between the MMR and increasing autism rates. The doctor, Andrew Wakefield, was later found to have committed &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fraud&lt;/a&gt;, failed to report conflicts of interest and lost his license. The article was retracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://asatonline.org/research-treatment/resources/topical-articles/autism-and-vaccines-the-evidence-to-date/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Reams of science&lt;/a&gt; has since examined and re-examined the evidence, and found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Still, the debunked connection has found an afterlife as a talking point for anti-vaccine groups who have attracted a vocal minority of parents. The overwhelming majority of Americans still vaccinate children against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, alongside longtime anti-vaccine talking points about autism and “medical freedom”, Hotez said a new threat was the, “very pernicious health and wellness and influencer movement that’s got a big profit motive”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Outbreaks appear to be “occurring in the same [parts] of the US that had some of the lowest Covid vaccination rates”, said Hotez, introducing the possibility that anti-vaccine sentiment is “spilling over to childhood immunizations”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In June, Kennedy unilaterally &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all 17 expert members of a CDC advisory panel on vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/eight-new-cdc-vaccine-advisers-robert-f-kennedy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stacked&lt;/a&gt; the committee with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/25/rfk-vaccine-advisory-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt; ideological allies.

&lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrates significant alterations in circulating immune cell populations in patients with [primary Sjögren’s], linking these changes to clinical disease activity,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team further highlighted three specific immune cell types with potential as biomarkers of the disease, and possibly as targets for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings may provide mechanistic insights into … pathogenesis [disease development] and establish a foundation for developing … targeted therapeutic strategies,” the scientists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their study, “&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1756-185X.70276"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Immunophenotypic Profiling Reveals Circulating Lymphocyte Dysregulation in Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An autoimmune condition, &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/causes-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s is caused&lt;/a&gt; by the immune system mistakenly targeting the body’s own cells, causing an inflammatory response. This typically occurs in tear and salivary glands, leading to dry eyes and dry mouth — the most common &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the condition occurs without another underlying autoimmune disease, it is classified as primary Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several types of immune cells may contribute to Sjögren’s. Broadly, these include B cells, which produce antibodies, and T cells, which help coordinate the immune response and can kill infected or abnormal cells. Both are types of lymphocytes, a subset of white blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scientists looked for changes, patterns in immune cell types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some immune changes occur in specific tissues, dysregulation also affects lymphocytes circulating throughout the body. However, “the relationship between peripheral immune cell alterations and clinical outcomes is not fully understood,” the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify this relationship, the scientists assessed levels of several of T- and B-cell subtypes in blood samples from 43 people with primary Sjögren’s. Participants in this group had an average age of 43.5 and about 95% were female. A group of 46 participants without chronic inflammatory disorders, but with similar age and sex characteristics, served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, B-cell levels were significantly higher in the Sjögren’s patients than in controls, with elevated levels of one particular subtype, CD21-/low B-cells. This subtype is also present at high levels in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.535784/full"&gt;other chronic immune conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that higher levels of CD21-/low B-cells correlated with greater disease severity in this Sjögren’s population. Other subtypes of B-cells, on the other hand, were lower in the Sjögren’s patients than in the controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings demonstrate profound alterations in peripheral lymphocyte subsets in patients with [primary Sjögren’s], revealing distinct immune dysregulation patterns within T and B cell populations,” the researchers wrote. Alterations included significantly higher levels of certain immune cell subtypes and significantly lower levels of others. For some subtypes, levels correlated with disease severity as measured using the EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSAI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Altered levels of T-cell subtypes seen in Sjögren’s patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although overall levels of certain T cells, like T-helper (Th) and T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells, were similar between groups, patients with Sjögren’s showed altered levels of several T-cell subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, according to the researchers, Th2 and Th17 cells — types of helper T cells that coordinate immune responses — were significantly increased. These elevated Th2 and Th17 levels are consistent with their known roles in driving B cell hyperactivity and glandular inflammation, highlighting their contribution to early disease development, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, total cytotoxic T (Tc) cells, which target and kill damaged or infected cells, were significantly higher in the Sjögren’s group, and also correlated with more severe disease as measured by ESSAI scores, the data showed. The team also reported that the Tc1 and Tc17 subtypes were significantly decreased in patients compared with controls, and noted that higher Tc1 levels were associated with milder disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The identification of [these cell types] as potential mediators of disease activity, … highlights actionable pathways for further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings may provide insight into the processes that cause primary Sjögren’s, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The identification of CD21−/low B cells as potential mediators of disease activity, alongside Th17 or Tc cell imbalances, highlights actionable pathways for further exploration,” the team wrote. These three cell types may provide biological markers of disease state and potential therapeutic targets, they noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while the scientists say their findings “provide a foundation for understanding T and B cell dysfunction” in primary Sjögren’s, they add that “future multicenter studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate these observations and explore their therapeutic implications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team noted several limitations to the study, specifically that this disease population tended to have milder forms of Sjögren’s. People with more severe versions of the disease may show different patterns in immune dysregulation, the team cautioned. This could indicate different immune processes at play depending on disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;

Insulin is just the messenger. When sugar levels are high in the bloodstream, insulin instructs body cells to open their doors and allow sugar in. But under certain circumstances cells ignore insulin's message and the doors remain shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the doors stay shut, you've got two problems. One, you don't get enough fuel (sugar) into the cells, so you're tired. Two, sugar stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the sugar is removed and stored as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How likely is it that you have insulin resistance? "Pretty likely ,and getting more likely all the time," says Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IRJuly25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of adults with insulin resistance has doubled in the last 20 years, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507839/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22206-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic reports&lt;/a&gt; this is due to many factors including worsening diets, the exposure to more drugs and toxins, more stress and more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Insulin resistance is perhaps the most serious epidemic in the world today, Roberts says. "It can lead to all the major killers including heart disease, obesity, strokes, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/sugar--insulin-resistance-and-cancer--what-is-the-link.h00-159461634.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;13 types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The good news is that we are learning all the time better ways to reverse it. Some are surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Pixel-Shot - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One: Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9036496/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine showed that people who get less than seven hours of sleep have higher levels of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a problem since well over half my patients have some form of insomnia. They struggle falling asleep, staying asleep, or just getting sound sleep," Roberts says. "That's why at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IRJuly25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, improving our patients' quality and quantity of sleep is one of our highest priorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep, however, is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we have found that lowering total body inflammation through a proprietary combination of herbs, foods and therapies leads to improved sleep in almost all of our patients," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Nasnunt - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Two: Antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second surprising way to reverse insulin resistance is to increase your consumption of antioxidants. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1865087/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;One study showed&lt;/a&gt; that taking 2 grams of vitamin C for two weeks resulted in a significant change in insulin resistance. Roberts explains this is why Health Utah's health and weight loss program relies heavily on eating foods rich in antioxidants. Additionally certain foods with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602234/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;high polyphenol and phytonutrient content&lt;/a&gt; are recommended as they have also been found to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is the hard part. Everyone knows they should be eating better. It's just hard when low-quality foods are flavor-enhanced, sugar-laced, caffeine boosted and so convenient. That's why the health and weight loss program at Health Utah focuses heavily on making the transition to healing foods easier. They use a process called framework that engages the subconscious mind to reframe your relationship with food. Weekly classes and educational materials also provide skills, tools, and strategies necessary to achieve sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: hocine - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three: Lemon juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craziest way science has found to help reverse insulin resistance is drinking lemon juice. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7468735/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Scientific research&lt;/a&gt; is now reflecting what holistic healers have suggested for years, that lemon juice has a powerful effect for good in the body, even improving sensitivity to insulin and lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IRJuly25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; utilize this kind of knowledge in working with their patients. Lemon juice has been a consistent part of their health and weight loss program for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When our patients start their health and weight loss program, they begin by cleaning out the body. This requires improving liver function," Roberts says. "Lemons, herbs and in-office therapies facilitate this detoxification as well as the reversal of insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Utah specializes in sustainable weight loss. Everything they do is geared toward this goal. Their coaching, their classes, their work with the subconscious mind, the fact that they don't count calories or cut out carbs and their focus on reversing insulin resistance create a lasting solution to the health and weight issues of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR2" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; invites KSL readers to take advantage of a $59 weight loss package. The package allows two people to get body scans. These scans identify potential underlying conditions that cause insulin resistance and stubborn weight.

              &lt;p&gt;Today’s cough syrup could turn into tomorrow’s treatment for Parkinson’s disease. Recent research in the U.K. is the latest to suggest that a common ingredient in cough syrup, ambroxol, might be able to slow down the progression of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at St. Joseph’s Health Care London conducted the year-long small study, which involved 55 patients with Parkinson’s-related dementia. The drug was safely tolerated and may have stabilized people’s symptoms, particularly people more genetically vulnerable to the neurodegenerative disease. Researchers elsewhere have already begun to test ambroxol for Parkinson’s and related dementias in larger trials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW34920009 BCX0 NormalTextRun" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"&gt;“These findings suggest &lt;span class="TextRun SCXW34920009 BCX0 NormalTextRun SpellingErrorV2Themed" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"&gt;Ambroxol&lt;/span&gt; may protect brain function, especially in those genetically at risk. It offers a promising new treatment avenue where few currently exist,” said study author Stephen Pasternak, a cognitive neuroscientist at Lawson Research Institute, the research arm of St. Joseph’s Health Care London, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sjhc.london.on.ca/research/stories/landmark-study-investigates-potential-of-ambroxol-cough-medicine-to-slow"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/ambroxol.html"&gt;Ambroxol&lt;/a&gt; is commonly used as an expectorant in cough syrup, helping thin out mucus so people with respiratory illnesses can clear phlegm from their airways and breathe easier. But recently, scientists have speculated that it can also target a key driver of Parkinson’s, the accumulation of abnormal alpha-synuclein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies have found that ambroxol can raise people’s levels of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), another protein that helps regulate the brain’s waste clearance system. In people with Parkinson’s, levels of GCase tend to decline as levels of abnormal alpha-synuclein rise. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.gaucherdisease.org/blog/gaucher-disease-and-parkinsons-what-to-know-now/"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; that people with certain genetic mutations affecting GCase function are at higher risk for Parkinson’s. Scientists have hoped that ambroxol can indirectly lower people’s alpha-synuclein by increasing GCase, reversing or at least slowing down the progression of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers randomized people with Parkinson’s-related dementia to either receive a placebo or a high dose of ambroxol (taken via pills daily) over a 12-month span. There were no severe symptoms linked to the drug’s use, the researchers found, and common adverse effects were typically gastrointestinal. People on placebo also experienced worsening psychiatric symptoms of their Parkinson’s and an increase in levels of GFAP (a blood marker of brain damage), whereas those on ambroxol appeared to stay about the same.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW34920009 BCX0 NormalTextRun" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"&gt;“This early trial offers hope and provides a strong foundation for larger studies,” Pasternak said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s results, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2835760"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; late last month in JAMA Neurology, were not a clear home run, however. There was overall no difference in cognition between the placebo and treatment groups, for instance. People with GCase-related genetic mutations taking the drug may have experienced improved cognition, though the sample sizes were too small to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, enough evidence has built up that other scientists are taking a chance on ambroxol. There are at least &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05778617"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04588285"&gt;clinical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://neurologyopen.bmj.com/content/5/2/e000535"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; of the drug for Parkinson’s and similar conditions linked to GCase underway right now. The largest of these trials is testing ambroxol in over 300 people with Parkinson’s over a two-year span. It will take years for these studies to wrap up, but if successful, ambroxol could very well become the first treatment able to slow down the destruction caused by Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Stelford's team treated the squirrels for fleas, gave them fluids and placed them in a cozy incubator to warm up.

Obviously, no one at the center wanted to hurt them, but the scared babies didn’t know that yet.

They’ll be at the center for another six weeks or so before hopefully being released back where they were found.

I’m not talking about bad body odor—just regular human smells.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And despite being in a new relationship, the smell of her partner's 'skin, breath and hair turns my stomach.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An anonymous woman revealed how menopause has caused her sense of smell to become overly sensitive (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The drop in estrogen and progesterone that causes the menopause has a vast array of effects on the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/07/perimenopause-smell-strong-sex-advice.html"&gt;Slate's advice column&lt;/a&gt;, the woman said: 'If I focus on the sensations in my body, I can sometimes put the smells out of my mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But other times, I just can’t, and I avoid any physical contact or even sitting too close to them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe perimenopause and menopause can alter a woman's sense of smell due to a dip in hormone levels, though it's unclear how common this is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also unclear how many of the 75million US women undergoing menopause experience changes in smell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perimenopause starts around a woman's mid to late 40s, roughly eight to 10 years before the onset of menopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During this time, the ovaries produce less estrogen and progesterone, which are responsible for regulating menstrual cycles and fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once hormones start to fluctuate, most women in perimenopause and menopause start having irregular or skipped periods, mood changes, low sex drive, vaginal dryness, hot flashes, night sweats and sleep issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, estrogen and progesterone also help maintain the olfactory system, a group of structures including the nose, nasal cavities and olfactory nerve that control sense of smell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These hormones are thought to help regenerate olfactory sensory neurons and connect them to the olfactory bulb, the brain's smell processing center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some women, menopause may make the olfactory system less sensitive, but in others it could heighten these senses.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unnamed woman in the advice column wrote: 'I’ve tried showering with them before sex to see if that helps (it doesn’t) and using scented products on my own skin to see if I can drown out their smell (I can’t). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I know it’s me, and they smell perfectly normal.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman also noted she feels self-conscious bringing up the issue to her new partner.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, menopausal women may experience phantosmia, or smelling odors that aren't actually there. It makes up about 10 to 20 percent of disorders that affect sense of smell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Menopausal women with a heightened sense of smell can use air purifiers to help reduce lingering odors and try to use unscented products whenever possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has also been shown to alleviate menopause symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats, and anecdotal evidence suggests it could normalize sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there are no medications or concrete treatments for the side effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Creatine may also offer benefits tied to hormonal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creatine can help ease fatigue during your period by supporting stable energy levels,” Rupar continued, “especially when you’re feeling more tired.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oestrogen and progesterone, &lt;a href="/topic/hormones"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt; that regulate the menstrual cycle, influence how the body produces and uses creatine, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During the menstrual cycle, creatine levels can change, and supplements may help keep energy and muscle function more stable, especially when oestrogen is low,” Rupar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 fcVRZz"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Creatine may help women support muscle strength, brain function, and energy levels" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-16783"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Creatine may help women support muscle strength, brain function, and energy levels&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

posted on her &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel earlier this year, Dr. Jen Claude weighed in on the question of how much me-time is too much me-time, and her answer might surprise a few people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How often should you masturbate?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Well, I've got some perhaps good news for you," she began. "Before I give you the answer let me remind you that masturbation is perfectly fine, okay? Masturbation actually can be a very healthy part of overall life and fulfilment, so I don't want you to think that masturbation is not okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr. Claude went on to state that the 'truth of the matter is: masturbate as much as you want', because there's 'no hard and fast answer' - pun probably not intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Masturbating as much as you like is recommended by a professional (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"There's not a top limit threshold. It's nothing like 'oh you can't masturbate more than this amount of times,' there's not a lower threshold, there's not a number of times in a day, a week, a month," she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Certain people masturbate multiple times a day, some people masturbate only certain times every few months depending on whatever. Some people masturbate when they're in a certain mood, some people masturbate at other times, it just depends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She did warn that it's paramount not to let masturbation interfere with the rest of your life, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The only caveat [is] you can masturbate as much as you want so long as it doesn't interfere with your daily life; it doesn't interfere with your mental wellbeing, it does not interfere with your relationships; interfere with your ability to go to your job or lead a happy, healthy, productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"In certain situations you can see how masturbation becomes compulsive, in which case we say that you need to be evaluated, you need to discuss this with a licensed professional, okay?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;There are plenty of benefits (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of masturbation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Masturbating in the morning can be an energy boost, didn't you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr. Sham Singh of The Handy &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/when-how-often-masturbation-health-benefits-doctor-explains-467675-20250430"&gt;previously revealed&lt;/a&gt;: "There isn't a certain time of day that’s better than any other, so it’s better for people to find their 'ideal' time that suits them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But it turns out that there are benefits to masturbating at certain times in the day, depending on what you're looking to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“For example, some might find it easier to sleep after masturbation at night because of the hormones released, which can help bring on relaxation. Others might prefer to do it in the morning because they find it energising," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As for how this act of self-care improves sleep and relieves stress, the doctor explained: When it comes to physical aspects, it can relieve muscle tension, help to improve the state of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/sleep"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and even relieve premenstrual tension caused by menstruation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“It may also be understood as a minor psychological and stress-relieving exercise. Exploring one's body and preferences can also enable better communication and satisfaction in sexual relationships,” he mentioned as a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/mental-health"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; bonus. "Looking into the science of it, masturbating can stimulate the release of endorphins and other happy neurotransmitters that may include dopamine and oxytocin, thus increasing mood and reducing anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Masturbation also aids in the relief of menstrual pain for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The contractions of the uterus as a result of an orgasm are then followed by relaxation, which can relieve cramping," Dr. Singh noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens when you stop masturbating?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/what-happens-if-you-stop-masturbating-body-brain-403629-20240527"&gt;According to an anonymous sex writer&lt;/a&gt;, there's so many ways that lack of masturbation can affect you and those around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Mood swings for one. "Masturbation withdrawal may sound far-fetched, but masturbation releases a delicious cocktail of feel-good chemicals and hormones and whatnots, so it seemed reasonable to me that my body was all like, 'Hey where'd that awesome stuff go?'" she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;There's an extended period of untamed arousal too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The build-up to satisfaction went from minutes to days, sometimes a week," she revealed of her own experiences. "Orgasm became an event to be longed for and fantasised about instead of another item to check off my to-do list like dry-cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Now when I found myself unexpectedly in the mood, my thoughts turned to 'Won't it be nice when my boyfriend gets home...' instead of 'Where the hell did I put that Hitachi Magic wand?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Pestering of your partner is certainly a side effect you want to avoid, as this'll really start to grate on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The writer said that she ended up 'getting a little desperate' after a while and joked that despite her other half being mostly happy to comply, he wasn't 'always in the mood to act as a member of my personal stud farm'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She signed off with: "Dignity flies out the window when you're desperate to get down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:12:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQNHcxR1lPYWtaR0sxMVJCX2JLTENXUVA3bUx3d1Z5ZlJaREowVmU5V0RJcXBzdExJeVN2SDBGT2NUMlZVOXNEd1VZRFVtM1VObHhMYXhRVXpwbFd0QS14cngtTjFZcGlSZmZnWkMzb1dKcV9CeXRJNEN5bkFMUWJoeDlFZFFPOWZZbEpxNS16UTRIeFlieWNHT2x6Mk1QYXozN3Vr</guid></item><item><title>“冰箱香烟”是Z世代对健怡可乐的新痴迷，让健康专家感到担忧- AOL.com | 'Fridge cigarette' is Gen Z's new Diet Coke obsession that concerns health experts - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBWSHlXSEp6Vk8xSFdjdFV3V2o0c0JlVGZ0M3ZVXzJyNXNFX0Q3T05EU3NheE5zWHJkWmhicC00cFJ2MWwxc3JxNUQtOXgzbUZiMWRsYmhGb0hXZHJKSXhCTEhsZTJONTlwLWN6RVExaFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mid-afternoon cigarette break has taken a new form for Gen Z with a sweet, bubbly twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos about "fridge cigarettes" have garnered hundreds of thousands of likes on TikTok this summer as scores of young adults have raved about the pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fix is &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/soft-drinks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diet soda,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diet soda,&lt;/a&gt; particularly Diet Coke — chilled to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/experts-say-quitting-diet-coke-can-improve-heart-health-gut-balance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Experts Say Quitting Diet Coke Can Improve Heart Health And Gut Balance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts Say Quitting Diet Coke Can Improve Heart Health And Gut Balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just a little something to take the edge off," one &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/viral-videos" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt; of a Diet Coke can read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Time for my afternoon fridge cigarette," another said of the same soda brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Thanks to a viral TikTok trend, 20-somethings across America are reaching for refrigerated diet sodas instead of cigarettes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third video caption reads, "Fridge cigarette after a long day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's the appeal behind the TikTok trend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Alpert, a psychotherapist based in New York City, said the trend works because Diet Coke can act as an "emotional stand-in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/coca-cola-announces-new-orange-cream-flavor-iconic-nostalgic-taste" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Coca-cola Announces New Orange Cream Flavor: 'Iconic And Nostalgic Taste';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Coca-cola Announces New Orange Cream Flavor: 'Iconic And Nostalgic Taste'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It becomes a way [for people] to pause, reset or reward themselves," the expert told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[It's] a small ritual that offers structure or comfort in the middle of a hectic day.

It is the fifth most common form of cancer worldwide, killing an estimated 770,000 people per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic infection with H. pylori is a major cause, and it helps explain the rise in stomach cancers among young people in recent years, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people are infected with H. pylori as children, and they may be infected for years without knowing it because the infection doesn’t cause symptoms. But it can also cause ulcers or inflammation in the stomach lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria can spread by mouth, for example kissing, or through contact with vomit or stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where stomach cancer cases will rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) cancer research agency analysed stomach cancer data from 185 countries in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They projected that under current trends, 11.9 million people could be diagnosed with stomach cancer attributable to H. pylori infection by 2101, which is the year someone born in 2017 would turn 84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of bacteria-linked stomach cancer cases – 8 million – are expected in Asia. Another nearly 471,000 cases are projected in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway and Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burden of stomach cancer is also shifting globally. While sub-Saharan Africa currently has relatively few cases, the researchers expect stomach cancer cases tied to H. pylori to rise to 1.4 million by 2101 – six times higher than the rate in 2022 – due to ageing and population changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With demographic changes set to increase the gastric cancer burden in many parts of the world, there is an urgent need for coordinated prevention strategies and for regional health systems to be prepared to manage the growing burden,” said Dr Jin Young Park, one of the study’s co-authors and head of the gastric cancer prevention team at the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has some limitations, notably poor data quality in lower-income countries that can make it harder to make confident predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers said the data is clear enough for health authorities around the world to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They called for countries to invest in initiatives to screen and quickly treat people for H. pylori infection. Their analysis shows that such programmes could reduce the number of expected stomach cancer cases by up to 75 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is essential that health authorities make gastric cancer prevention a priority and accelerate efforts to control it,” Park said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Euronews.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 15:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxORmpIMlo0M3d3MjBOelp2Tk9CbUF2TllqMnNvSVJQcVpuUDdDRnhlNEV2dFkzOEc1MUpreU9RemNqRGlJVlpLZGJyN1JuV0tuaU5yR1h1SGhSRlJsMWQydkNBN2RURExqUmRWbzlGcFRYY0xOSEpRMDZlWGN5Z2hWdENHbFBKeWdHTFkzelRmSllhMGxYQVFZa2V0TUwxbDBURFp2QjhWZlBWSnFDTGE0WFBQRWhxODUzR053VkoxMlhpb0hTWTFIRmktc3lzQQ</guid></item><item><title>育儿建议：我想帮助我的家人度过医疗紧急情况。但不是这样的。-石板 | Parenting advice: I want to help my family through a medical emergency.

Have you ever thought about writing into Care and Feeding? Now’s the time—our inbox is in need of more questions! Conundrums big and small are welcome, and of course, it’s anonymous. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeI516MVbV7en9S-8krL2zppY_GWq-qad7K_P7iUvxcD7t6vA/viewform"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Submit your family and parenting questions to Care and Feeding here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. (Or your questions about anything else to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/life/2023/06/advice-columns-submit-questions.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;other columns here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7ulgu00093b76z4u1jomq@published"&gt;My brother and his wife live nearby, and our kids get along well. We definitely have different parenting styles, but we talk through them. We’re comfortable with this, and we often host each other’s children for the day. There’s one major difference: Our kids (ages 3 and 5) are sleep trained, but my brother and sister-in-law never sleep trained their 5-year-old son, “Pete.” They’ve mentioned having to get up with him several times a night. Pete seems fine otherwise, and since it was their choice, I left it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7unw9000f3b768lo9gelc@published"&gt;But now that’s changing. They’ve asked us to take Pete for a while when his baby brother is born, and we haven’t really said “yes” because we’re trying to figure out how to handle it. My SIL is in her third trimester and found out that the birth will be complicated. Their baby will, at minimum, spend time in the NICU. It’s scary, and we’re all hoping everything goes well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7ur8j000l3b76dvnywvi8@published"&gt;It feels cruel to tell them to sleep train a 5-year-old in the last months of a difficult pregnancy, or else we can’t babysit him. But it also won’t get easier once the baby is born. If it were only two or three nights, we’d manage, but we’re probably going to be caring for Pete for longer stretches in that first month, unless the birth goes miraculously well. My husband’s work shifts mean sleep is precious in our household. I’m usually the nighttime parent, and I cannot be getting up multiple times every night, outside of emergencies and regular parenting stuff.&lt;br&gt;All this will already be a series of hard transitions for Pete. How do we approach the conversation with my brother and SIL?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7v0fq00133b76qtgl0poa@published"&gt;As tricky as this is, your brother and his wife are in an emergency medical situation they neither asked for nor planned for. This is a time when you need to step up. You don’t have to turn your own life totally upside down, but you should be prepared to make some adjustments or concessions. By asking questions and setting expectations now, you can help make the transition smoother for everyone. So, go ahead and say yes, but ask for a chat about the specifics of what caring for Pete might actually look like. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-list/instances/cmco7v4pm00193b76fn9vqvdw@published" class="slate-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are they willing to let you set boundaries around Pete’s nighttime waking? Are they open to using tools like an OK-to-Wake clock, or placing a nightly limit on how many times he can get out of bed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of those boundaries lead to sleep training Pete—whether inadvertently or intentionally on your part—are they OK with that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the waking is due to bedwetting, what kinds of interventions (mattress pads, special pajamas, wetness sensors) have they tried, or would they be open to you exploring?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long do they anticipate this arrangement lasting? What happens if they need to extend it? And what happens if they need more time, but you can’t accommodate it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the nighttime waking becomes too much and you need help, are they willing to contribute financially to a solution, like hiring a nighttime nanny or flying in a grandma to give you a respite? (I truly hope this isn’t necessary for a 5-year-old, but covering all bases here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnxfvqf001o3b6hamhvoq8t@published"&gt;Let’s also acknowledge that Pete might do &lt;em&gt;great &lt;/em&gt;in a new environment, simply because you aren’t his parents and his routine will be different. He also might regress. Either way, knowing ahead of time what kind of freedom you’ll have to manage any challenges will allow you to be nimble in the moment. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

My parents divorced when I was 8 because my dad simply couldn’t deal with her erratic behavior anymore. (Some of her episodes involved chaining herself to a traffic light and threatening to jump off the roof of our house.) He was awarded sole custody of my sister and me. My mother was unable to hold a job and couldn’t pay child support. Her (supervised) visits eventually stopped, even before she was admitted for inpatient treatment. My sister was less than 2 years old when our mom dropped out of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7wxkv001k3b76iaz2iwp4@published"&gt;Now, our mother has contacted us out of the blue, saying she wants a relationship. I am convinced she’s looking for a place to crash, someone to support her, or both. I have refused contact—I have two kids under 5 and no desire to put them in physical or emotional danger. My sister, however, is very excited over the prospect. She was too young to remember how unstable and terrifying our mom’s presence was, and I’m extremely concerned she’ll get hurt if she lets our mom back into her life. How can I get my sister to face reality?&lt;/p&gt;

As you said, she doesn’t have any memories from when things with your mom were really bad, and there is a big difference between hearing about it and experiencing it firsthand. Even at your most persuasive, I wonder whether your accounts of the past would be enough to convince her to walk away now; it’s very possible that your sister has been fantasizing about this kind of reunion for years. And though you may be right about your mother’s motives, it’s also conceivable that you are wrong—so I’m not sure forbidding your sister from finding out for herself is in anyone’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7x62000203b76kbkh6idu@published"&gt;All that aside, it is absolutely appropriate for you to set your own boundaries and be skeptical about your mother’s motives. Focus on equipping your sister with the knowledge she needs, so she doesn’t go into the meeting with rose-colored glasses. Discuss your concerns, identify warning signs to look out for, and make a plan for the boundaries your sister will maintain. For example, maybe she promises not to give your mother money. If your mom asks for any, then you and your sister can discuss it together.&lt;/p&gt;

I think there is a way to protect yourself and your sister while remaining open to the possibility that your mom has made progress. Good luck with whatever you decide.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7xhni002d3b76dsuo2ywk@published"&gt;My wife “Anling” has a fear of germs that borders on irrational. She keeps our 3-year-old son “Joseph” meticulously clean and won’t allow him to do normal kid things like roll around in the grass or play in the sand at the park. (My parents even bought him a kiddie sandbox, but Anling made me give it back to them.) She vacuums the entire house every single day and insists on changing Joseph’s clothes and bathing him every time they return from running errands. I don’t go along with any of this when I’m caring for our son on my own, but if Anling sees even a smudge of dirt on him, I get blasted.&lt;/p&gt;

The birds there (pigeons and seagulls) are very habituated to people, so I gave Joseph some popcorn to feed the pigeons while we waited for Anling to come back from the restroom. The pigeons ate right out of Joseph’s hands, and he was delighted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7xljc002l3b768fdk6wb4@published"&gt;The fun ended when my wife returned. She came running over, shouting and waving her arms to scare the birds away, then took hand sanitizer from her purse and slathered it all over Joseph’s hands and arms while he cried. Anling then caused a scene, berating me and calling me a “moron,” and said it would be my fault if our son got bird flu. She made us leave for home that day.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7xpj1002p3b76edykwcxa@published"&gt;Anling has always been a “clean freak,” but things really went into overdrive after Joseph was born—and my patience with her hypochondria has run dry. Beyond depriving our son of normal childhood experiences and making him anxious, I’m concerned she is setting him up for allergies and a weakened immune system, since he’s never exposed to anything. I’m ready to give Anling an ultimatum: Either she eases up, or we go our separate ways. Is that the right approach?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmco7xxww00353b7649cm3dia@published"&gt;If she is resistant, show her a list of characteristics for “illness anxiety disorder” (also known as hypochondria) and use that as a conversation tool. The goal isn’t to prove that she is “broken,” but to gently demonstrate how her behaviors are impacting you and your son.&lt;br&gt;If she acknowledges there’s a problem, the next step isn’t her “easing up” as you put it, but seeking individual and family therapy to learn some new coping skills.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnxgjk200293b6hmfsk0wet@published"&gt;I have a 14-year-old stepson whom I first met when he was a toddler. He spent weekends with his father and me until he was 7, when he moved in with us because his mom moved out of state and we were awarded physical custody. When we got married several years ago, I asked him what he wanted to call me, and he said “Mom.” He is smart, bright, funny, and generous, and he has a heart of gold. He deserves to have present, loving parents as much as every single kid out there does. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/02/stepson-love-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;And yet, I do not love him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These findings suggest that people with generalized anxiety disorder may have poorer emotion recognition abilities. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1506239"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD, is a mental health condition characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about everyday events and activities. People with GAD often expect that important events will turn out badly and worry excessively about health, work, family, or finances—even when there is little or no reason to do so. This chronic worry is difficult to control and typically persists for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common physical symptoms include restlessness, fatigue, muscle tension, irritability, and sleep disturbances. GAD can impair concentration and interfere with daily functioning and relationships. It belongs to a group of mental health conditions known as anxiety disorders. Estimates suggest that about 5.6% of people in China suffer from anxiety disorders, with 1.3% specifically affected by GAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Yuqi Shen and her colleagues aimed to compare affective control abilities in individuals with GAD and healthy participants. They hypothesized that difficulties in processing emotional information might play a role in the disorder. More specifically, they expected that affective inhibition and affective shifting would be linked to self-reported mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 50 individuals diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and 50 healthy control participants. In each group, 14 participants were female. The average age in the GAD group was 47 years, compared to 50 years in the healthy control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed standardized assessments of anxiety (the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), affective inhibition (using the Affective Flanker Task), and affective shifting (using the Affective Flexibility Task).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affective inhibition refers to the ability to suppress or ignore emotionally distracting information in order to stay focused on relevant tasks or goals. Affective flexibility, or shifting, refers to the ability to switch attention and responses between different emotional stimuli or tasks (such as identifying emotions versus counting people).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that individuals with GAD exhibited atypical patterns of affective inhibition. More specifically, they showed reduced proactive control—the ability to prepare and maintain focus on a task—and enhanced reactive control, which reflects a heightened response to conflicting or distracting emotional stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, people with GAD had more difficulty staying focused on emotionally relevant information and were more reactive to emotional distractions. They also had greater difficulty shifting attention between different task demands, particularly when those tasks involved emotional content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In sum, we found evidence that patients with GAD exhibit deficits in cognitive control within affective contexts compared to healthy adults. By measuring participants in two subcomponents of affective control (affective inhibition and affective shifting), we discovered that GAD patients show poorer emotion recognition abilities and impaired affective shifting functions,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the specificities of affective functioning in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder. However, it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow any definitive cause-and-effect conclusions to be derived from the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1506239"&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder patients’ cognitive control in affective contexts&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Yuqi Shen, Shasha Zhu, Shiqi Liao, Yuqing Zhao, Zihan Lin, Ke Jiang, Wenjing Yan, and Xinhua Shen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 14:12:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQeHNYUG4zVTVKNVFvR3dFM1dRTFlQdmhNbnNhU3ZFbUhOOXduZGhRRDRXamkwa0E3SDJYUkl1anpQNzVPUXZqdGc3bkt4ekFwV2hBV1E1MWMyeGo2Y1UwYUY3T1lEYnlFNF9BX2ZmZWVXaFA4b3I1ZzhXSDVXQnY4UkRXZGJaaENmVXVqb1NoZzQ1N0l2T0lPR3E5cVl3VzB4RDAwdm1Ncw</guid></item><item><title>专栏|我是一名胃肠病学家。这就是我告诉我的病人吃这种水果的原因。-《华盛顿邮报》 | Column | I’m a gastroenterologist.

Gut symptoms like bloating and constipation are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31917991/" target="_blank"&gt;incredibly common&lt;/a&gt;, affecting up to a third of the population. Many people don’t want to take medication if there are more natural ways to help. But I also know that simply recommending people &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/09/healthier-food-diet-advice/" target="_blank"&gt;increase their fiber intake&lt;/a&gt; is vague and not always useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GFOXN2HO4RFHFIPSCHNM45JGYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s why&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;I’ve been “prescribing” a dose of two kiwis a day to my patients for years now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4IZ5ZIXYYVGBFFRCBQ6C36OZM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A small but mighty green or gold fruit, kiwis are &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/77434/download" target="_blank"&gt;bursting with nutrients&lt;/a&gt;: A single kiwi contains 80 percent or more of an adult’s daily vitamin C requirement and packs two to four grams of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/13/legume-pasta-edamame-low-carb/" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to vitamins E and K and other beneficial antioxidants and phytochemicals, one of the kiwi’s most important properties is an enzyme called actinidin. Actinidin is present in only a few dietary sources besides kiwis (including mango and pineapple), and it can help break down proteins, aiding in our digestion. Actinidin is so powerful that it’s used commercially as a meat tenderizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YBSCQRCWDBAKXPMRPTRBJ67CP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So how does this help your gut?

On average, people pooped between one and two more times each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SFK4Y3XBFJG5ZNQ7IJZ3NBLQNI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For people with constipation at baseline, kiwis improved symptoms such as abdominal pain, indigestion and straining during &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/01/16/poop-frequency-color-meaning/" target="_blank"&gt;bowel movements&lt;/a&gt; — often even more so than &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/06/psyllium-supplement-how-much/" target="_blank"&gt;psyllium&lt;/a&gt;, a type of fiber sold in powders and capsules over-the-counter.

These compounds are known to protect against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522030064" target="_blank"&gt;cancer, cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/27/2/362/28291/Dietary-Antioxidant-Intake-and-Risk-of-Type-2" target="_blank"&gt;diabetes.&lt;/a&gt; But — and this is a big one — it’s an effect that mainly appears to occur through a healthy diet — and not through antioxidant supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A4NIAVRXEJFU3IOQ4KIO5L4P7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As is often the case with other &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/31/supplements-benefits-research-science/" target="_blank"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, when you try to distill the compound of interest into a capsule or pill, that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17327526/" target="_blank"&gt;beneficial health effect&lt;/a&gt; of antioxidants vanishes — and may even be potentially harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJHZZUKM4FF6VL2R3C7HBGEPAI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists suspect that the kiwi’s antioxidants, like vitamin C, synergize with its other naturally occurring phytochemicals to boost its protective power — something we lose when we distill these nutrients into a commercialized supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="5ZBJXROZRNHUVEKAWO4COUB6FA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="5ZBJXROZRNHUVEKAWO4COUB6FA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Kiwi’s benefits may go beyond the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RXYZ5QQLFNCJFFRVT7JPNXP2XQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2011, Norwegian researchers randomized healthy volunteers to a month of eating either one or two &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21586177/" target="_blank"&gt;gold kiwis daily&lt;/a&gt;. When the scientists analyzed DNA samples, they found fewer DNA strand breaks — a sign of improved fortitude that can theoretically reduce opportunities for cancerous growth.

Trust me, it won’t happen. And for many people, prunes can actually make bloating &lt;i&gt;worse &lt;/i&gt;due to high levels of sorbitol, a naturally occurring sugar that gets fermented by your colon’s microbiome. That’s why I tend to recommend kiwis instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="F3YEZYTGZ5C43D7QOBWNPOG2VQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="F3YEZYTGZ5C43D7QOBWNPOG2VQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;What I want my patients to know&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XVT6XTIS6BEMLNSXNSECE6VXRU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No, you don’t have to eat the kiwi’s peel. Plenty of studies have found notable health benefits &lt;i&gt;sans&lt;/i&gt; peel. But if you feel so inclined, go on, have a little nibble on the skin. It’s totally edible and packed with fiber. Just be sure to keep your doctor in the loop about your gut issues. For lots of people, the underlying condition causing their symptoms is past the point of a simpler dietary intervention. It’s why it’s important to find a doctor you trust who can consider multiple angles in approaching your health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-raw_html" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-cbTFcs wpds-c-cbTFcs-iPJLV-css" data-qa="raw-html"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drug target is a molecule, typically a protein, within the body that’s often involved in disease processes. Some of the newly discovered proteins are targeted by existing non-MS drugs, suggesting these therapies may be repurposed to treat MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery was reported in the study, “&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425537122"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Multiomics integration prioritizes potential drug targets for multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” published in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results demonstrate significant potential for both the discovery of new drugs and the repurposing of existing ones,” Yuan Jiang, a PhD candidate at the Karolinska Institute and the study’s first author, said in a &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/new-potential-drug-targets-for-multiple-sclerosis-identified"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS is marked by inflammatory damage to healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord. While several &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt; (DMTs) are available to manage the disease by reducing the frequency and severity of relapses and delaying disability progression, more effective therapies are needed, especially for people with progressive forms of MS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Identifying proteins, looking for roles in MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Continuous exploration of drug discovery, development, and repurposing has become increasingly crucial for improving both the efficacy and the safety of MS treatment,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify candidate proteins linked to MS, the Karolinska researchers first conducted a proteome-wide association study (PWAS), a method that looks for relationships between protein levels in the blood and brain and MS susceptibility. Here, 100 proteins in the blood and 212 proteins in brain tissue had levels that were significantly associated with MS susceptibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A technique called summary-data-based Mendelian randomization was then used to determine whether any of the proteins identified by PWAS played a causal role in MS. Overall, nine blood and nine brain proteins were considered causal and thus potential drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the blood proteins, CR1 and WARS were associated with an increased risk of MS, whereas TNFRSF1A, FCRL3, TYMP, PGLYRP1, CD59, IDUA, and ARHGAP1 were linked with a reduced risk of MS. In the brain, HLA-B, ZC2HC1A, HMGCL, TSFM, FAM120B, TRAF3, and MTHFR were tied to an increased risk of MS, while ICA1L and AUH were associated with a decreased MS risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments revealed that blood proteins were mostly produced by immune cells involved in MS, while brain proteins were mostly sourced to nerve cells and other supportive brain cells such as oligodendrocytes, the cells that produces myelin in the brain and spinal cord, astrocytes, and blood vessel cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subsequent analysis found that five of the nine blood drug targets interacted with 19 known targets of 10 approved MS medications. Likewise, two of the nine brain drug targets interacted with five known drug targets of six MS therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of the blood-based targets and two brain-based targets were also targeted by 16 existing drugs not used in MS, “suggesting potential opportunities for drug repurposing,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By integrating large-scale … data and applying advanced statistical methods, we have been able to prioritize drug targets that may improve the treatment of MS,” Jiang said.&lt;/p&gt;

Apart from getting it from foods, Vitamin D is also synthesised in the body when exposed to sunlight and hence it is also called the "sunshine vitamin". However, a large number of people across the world suffer from Vitamin D deficiency, often without even knowing it. This deficiency is mainly due to poor diets and limited sun exposure, and it can lead to more than just fatigue or low mood— it’s been linked to several serious health issues, some of which can be long-term or even life-threatening if ignored. Here we list some serious diseases Vitamin D deficiency can cause:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 12:44:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxPbURRVmpjZ2NLdmNQaVFvb3ZHRm0wT1VRa1RFRlRNbWlDYVRBMmx4djd4ZDdTbll2c19zUXFJZG1ORDdvcF9qc2VzbHdueWl6dElFYVVpVVVSWjVkaWhtakVUdFVBUHlSRUZ0aTJOUVVQRWdmTlFqM3ZJR1NMbVVWR09Qenp6UUlEeWRjeFZjbmtJSDN1S0tnVjg4SmFSVHVRNjFHczRHaTVhMFo3TW1Pd29wWjNyNzlaanpuVUVwVi1aaklwel9fZEZDUElEeXI2REpVY0w3VV9tcFo4cGhJQ25R</guid></item><item><title>戒酒后，我的体重激增。以下是我最终戒掉两种毒瘾的方法--《每日电讯报》 | My weight ballooned after I gave up drinking.

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Yet my personal life was in tatters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while all that was taking off, behind closed doors my personal life was slowly falling apart. Admittedly, there were already cracks in my six-year-old marriage when I was drinking. Midlife marriages can be complicated; I had&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;four step-children and my ex-wife had undergone cancer – more than once. I can’t have been easy to live with, and fundamentally we were cut from different cloth. Stopping drinking wasn’t a miraculous cure-all. My issues (a complicated childhood, a turbulent relationship which led to me constantly getting absolutely plastered, sleeping rough for four nights on the beach and culminated in the pain of my mum’s death in 2018) were all still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once sober I started seeing life in full 4K, realising what I did and didn’t want. So by 2022 my marriage was over and we’d separated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I packed my bags and left our London house, we both knew it was for the best. But it was unsettling, especially without alcohol as my trusty crutch any more, and with all the financial stress divorce brings. After moving around in-between rentals and hotels for the next year or so, I eventually bought my own place in the East Midlands. But I didn’t have many friends there, so apart from work (I now coach people online as well as give talks in schools, companies and for the Blue Light professions) life could sometimes feel fragile. I’d take Rosie, my dog, out for long, lonely walks thinking about life. But here’s the truth – while I’d remained sober throughout an emotional roller-coaster, I’d secretly swapped the booze addiction &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/life-with-food-addiction/"&gt;for a sugar one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one admits that swapping one addiction for another is incredibly common. Whether it’s food (like me) or shopping, work, exercise, social media – we all reach for something, people I meet in recovery circles all say the same thing. We’re all a bunch of hypocrites because we’re all human!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;I swapped my beer gut for a food belly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portion control was a problem, I thought I was being healthy having a weighty bowl of granola and Greek yoghurt in the morning, but I’d ladle on so much honey that breakfast alone was probably 700 calories. The bowl would weigh a tonne. Or I’d eat cinnamon buns, or wholemeal toast but slathered with peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lunch might be four chicken thighs with jacket potato and salad (and I’d polish my halo), then I’d tuck into a huge steak and chips for dinner – enough to feed an entire rugby team. I wasn’t a bad cook, it wasn’t like I’d left all that to my wife during marriage, but I was naive about portion sizes and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the evenings, I’d come home from a long day talking to people about alcohol addiction and scoff a family-sized apple crumble with vast amounts of ice cream&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; nipping back for more until – ah, f--k it – I’d finish the lot. “I’m allowed treats, I’ve stopped boozing,” I’d tell myself. But just like my drinking had stopped being something sociable by the end, so too had my eating. It was something I’d privately binge for a dopamine hit, along with a huge dollop of shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ballooned back up to 19st 8lb through comfort eating, yet all the while I was out there giving talks, helping people get sober. I felt like a greedy fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Though it's now clear humans continue to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adults-grow-new-brain-cells-and-they-help-us-learn-through-listening"&gt;grow new brain cells&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-neurons-are-still-developing-in-our-brains-even-when-we-re-80-years-old"&gt;their entire lives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/adult-human-brains-dont-grow-new-neurons-in-hippocampus-contrary-to-prevailing-view-93123"&gt;debate persists&lt;/a&gt; over whether this applies to specific areas involved with memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Previous studies have made the case &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-019-0375-9"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0676-20.2020"&gt;against&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the existence of neurogenesis in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; beyond childhood. &lt;/span&gt;A new study now offers some of the clearest evidence yet that this crucial memory-forming region does form fresh neurons well into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the work of researchers from the Karolinska Institute and the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, and looks specifically at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus"&gt;dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; section of the hippocampus, the part of the brain that acts as a key control center for emotions, learning, and storing episodic memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-identifies-unexpected-part-of-your-brain-thats-uniquely-human?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;New Study Identifies Unexpected Part of Your Brain That's Uniquely Human&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gives us an important piece of the puzzle in understanding how the human brain works and changes during life," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/new-research-confirms-that-neurons-form-in-the-adult-brain"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Jonas Frisén.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirmation that humans can form new neurons in the hippocampus through life (as several other animals can) would inform a whole host of other scientific investigations, from how adults &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/window-for-mastering-new-language-wider-than-we-thought"&gt;learn new skills&lt;/a&gt; to what happens to the brain as it deteriorates &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night-study-says"&gt;in old age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used RNA analysis to identify functions of brain cells in samples collected from people up to age 78, finding that some neurons were geared to function as neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which generate new nerve cells. The researchers also found similarities between human NPCs and those &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.10.036"&gt;in mice, pigs, and monkeys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166907" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166907" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronScans.jpg" alt="Neuron scan charts" class="wp-image-166907 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronScans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronScans-516x415.jpg 516w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/NeuronScans-600x482.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166907" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers compared neuron production between children, adults, and other animals.

That might point to differences in brain plasticity that affect learning, personality, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;disease risk&lt;/a&gt;, but that's something that future studies will need to look at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis is that certain brain conditions might be affected by how quickly fresh new neurons can be produced – some of the subjects in this study had a history of psychiatric or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-might-not-start-in-the-brain-study-finds"&gt;neurological diseases&lt;/a&gt; – but again this wasn't something that the researchers looked at directly, so follow-up studies will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research may also have implications for the development of regenerative treatments that stimulate neurogenesis in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/new-research-confirms-that-neurons-form-in-the-adult-brain"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Frisén.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adu9575"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="story-summary-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In postmenopausal women with heart disease, excess weight could be linked to an especially high risk of developing breast cancer, according to international researchers. The team looked at data from over 168,000 postmenopausal women who did not have type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease when they agreed to participate. After a follow-up of around 10 years, over 6,000 developed breast cancer, and the team found that in women who developed cardiovascular disease during the study, each 5 point increase in BMI was associated with a 31% higher risk of breast cancer when compared to women without cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does body mass index affect breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women with and without cardiovascular disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis shows that weight-associated breast cancer risk is higher in women with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research reveals that excess weight is linked to an especially high risk of developing breast cancer in postmenopausal women with cardiovascular disease. The findings are published by &lt;a href="https://zwly9k6z.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.wiley.com%2F/1/01000197cb39c7fe-8757bfab-e5e9-498d-a8c0-092e46891925-000000/ar_rreNj0Y8xYzsWyvyAKaqESzY=433"&gt;Wiley&lt;/a&gt; online in &lt;a href="https://zwly9k6z.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Facsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fjournal%2F10970142%3Fdmmsmid=73865%26dmmspid=22624228%26dmmsuid=1961220/1/01000197cb39c7fe-8757bfab-e5e9-498d-a8c0-092e46891925-000000/dJyVq8jWm3Qmy5Q9R1Pd5vB3IZw=433"&gt;CANCER&lt;/a&gt;, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although higher body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women, it’s unclear whether this risk differs among women with and without cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes. To investigate, a team led by Heinz Freisling, PhD, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (the specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization) analyzed data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and UK Biobank on 168,547 postmenopausal women who did not have, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease when they agreed to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a median follow-up of 10.7 years in EPIC and 10.9 years in UK Biobank, 6,793 postmenopausal women developed breast cancer. In a pooled analysis of both studies, each 5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; increase in BMI was associated with a 31% higher risk of breast cancer in women who developed cardiovascular disease during follow-up and a 13% higher risk in women without cardiovascular disease. The development of type 2 diabetes did not seem to affect breast cancer risk: women with or without type 2 diabetes had a similarly elevated breast cancer risk related to higher BMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of overweight (BMI≥25 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and cardiovascular disease was estimated to lead to 153 more cases of breast cancer per 100,000 people per year than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings of this study could be used to inform risk-stratified breast cancer screening programs,” said Dr. Freisling. “This study should also inspire future research to include women with a history of cardiovascular diseases in weight loss trials for breast cancer prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;

What isn’t discussed as often is the role that diet plays in keeping your muscles in good shape. “You can’t get stronger without eating properly, so diet is essential,” says Elizabeth Klingbeil, an assistant professor in the department of nutritional sciences at the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4H4DJGMYNBH3TJOWSLUP2MO45Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Follow these eating tips to fuel muscle growth and feel stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3LFVGOBZ4JGZXLVNOIISFQVNHM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3LFVGOBZ4JGZXLVNOIISFQVNHM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Bump up your protein&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T57RJ4CAXJH4HDK6EDJEMNXNUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Protein is core to building muscle and, even more so, maintaining it, Klingbeil says. The National Academy of Sciences recommends that adults eat 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. But an &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-019-1174-1" target="_blank"&gt;analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt; found that 42 percent of men and 50 percent of women over age 70 don’t get that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZBDPN3YSSJAXLD2WTHH6OSUXA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some experts recommend even more protein for older adults to compensate for muscle loss and the fact that building new muscle becomes harder with age, Klingbeil says. Aim for 0.45 to 0.59 grams per pound per day — that’s 72 to 94 grams for a 160-pound person. (But if you have kidney disease, check with your doctor about your protein intake because too much can tax your kidneys.) Dietitians generally recommend spreading protein throughout the day because that may help your body absorb it better, but Klingbeil says that getting enough is the most important thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YDDEDAEALRBLDEND2P6Q6IUGTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The source of protein isn’t super important for building muscle, says Travis Masterson, the principal investigator of the Health, Ingestive Behavior, and Technology Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University. &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-eating/how-red-meat-can-fit-into-a-healthy-diet-a3360518260/" target="_blank"&gt;Animal foods&lt;/a&gt; tend to have more per serving than plant sources. But for other aspects of your health, it’s best to get at least some of your protein from plants, such as beans, nuts and tofu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IRDQYIYNQRADVN33ET622RPCSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A plant-based diet that includes mostly whole foods is good for your heart and brain, and it lowers your risk of certain cancers. “It also appears to be gentler on the kidneys than a diet high in animal protein as we age,” says Judy Lester, a clinical dietitian at the University of North Carolina Health Care System in Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GH2FAXJWWBAZRD7IUXPWZ2N2JM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are 20 grams of protein in a cup of tofu; about 18 grams in a cup of lentils, white beans or edamame; 8 grams in a cup of quinoa or whole-wheat pasta; and 7 grams in an ounce of peanuts. Beef and chicken breast have about 24 grams in 3 ounces. A 5.5-ounce serving of plain nonfat &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/yogurt/healthy-yogurts-that-taste-great-too-a1114386696/" target="_blank"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; has 16 grams, a cup of low-fat milk has about 8 grams, and an egg has 6 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZK4XCWDUMFAJ3ITFWG4HWXFO3Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZK4XCWDUMFAJ3ITFWG4HWXFO3Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Get enough calories&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSOR7IS6WZDDDOGXPMEKFMTYPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you’re not getting enough calories, your body will break down muscle,” Klingbeil says. Calorie needs vary based on height, weight, gender and activity levels, but eating somewhere between 1,800 to 2,400 calories per day is probably adequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="TWVS7NA4JNGBXOYJQIGUBT24JE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="TWVS7NA4JNGBXOYJQIGUBT24JE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Choose quality carbs&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4HLP2AP2TNAFNKCC5MXNOHELNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Carbohydrates fuel your muscles, so they can help you feel stronger. The best sources are whole grains, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/canned-foods/best-tasting-canned-beans-a6489833691/" target="_blank"&gt;legumes&lt;/a&gt;, fruits and vegetables. Refined carbs like white bread, crackers, soda and desserts can boost short-term energy, but unlike high-quality carbs, they don’t have the advantage of being rich in fiber and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N6ONHD5KMVEHBAJ6XW6J6I33BQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research shows that fiber may help build or preserve muscle mass, possibly because it increases the level of healthy bacteria in the gut that produce short-chain fatty acids. These compounds are involved in muscle development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3FNHAQMUYVBQBHPGNURK34JYWY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3FNHAQMUYVBQBHPGNURK34JYWY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Check your vitamin D&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WWMN4HG46ZHJHCLGQCGQ5CM52Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some studies show a connection between vitamin D levels and muscle strength, although it’s not clear whether getting more vitamin D from your diet or a supplement will help you become stronger. Still, we know that the vitamin is important for bone, muscle and overall health, Klingbeil says, so getting the recommended 20 micrograms (800 IU) per day is smart. New guidelines from the Endocrine Society don’t recommend regular vitamin D testing for healthy adults, so ask your doctor what’s right for you given your particular health picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="KRXJGKPPORF3LMBN4RULB7XRXE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="KRXJGKPPORF3LMBN4RULB7XRXE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Add omega-3s&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BKKYM6XZBJHNRFONVSUNDH5PLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These fats, found in fish, may help protect from normal age-related declines in muscle. In a 2020 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7071242/" target="_blank"&gt;review of research on sarcopenia published in the journal Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, researchers noted that eating fatty fish was linked to increases in muscle mass and better performance on muscle-strength tests. Other studies have shown similar benefits for people who took omega-3 supplements, but the science isn’t conclusive. For now, aim to eat two servings of fatty fish like salmon or sardines per week, which is the American Heart Association’s recommendation for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3OMT3BM3TREURCJBIUXZG7Y4DE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3OMT3BM3TREURCJBIUXZG7Y4DE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Stay hydrated&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AWSQBKKSIZGC7FGU5ZXELUELOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Getting plenty of fluids is important for overall health and preserving muscle, Lester says. Muscle is 70 to 75 percent water, and insufficient water content inside muscle cells has been linked to changes in muscle strength and the ability to do daily activities, as well as a higher risk of frailty in older adults. Drinking water is obviously helpful, but you can also get fluids from other healthy beverages (coffee, tea and milk, for instance) and eating fruits, vegetables and soup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="27RN3PBZ6ZHQXEEXMNXSKMZB7I" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="27RN3PBZ6ZHQXEEXMNXSKMZB7I" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Ask your doctor about creatine&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZGWRCV2EIRAR3EQS6T5VAC7NGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This compound in muscle tissue is found in meat and seafood, and your body also makes it. But taking it in pill or powder form may be helpful for some people. “Creatine in the muscle is used for producing energy, especially in that initial onset of a contraction, the first one to two seconds,” Masterson says. “The more creatine you can get into the muscle, the more effective that first bit of contraction is going to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VQTOXJB2GBHX5KYLJJ4B2OO6CE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Creatine is often used by athletes looking to improve exercise performance, but some research suggests that older adults may benefit from it, too. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6518405/" target="_blank"&gt;review published in 2019 in the Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that creatine — in combination with regular &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dumbbells/strength-training-using-adjustable-dumbbells-a3150717795/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; — may help reduce the risk of sarcopenia and falls. (Muscle is important for balance, too.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XEJOXQIGZZGEVKU4PSOFP4NWDQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I’m pretty anti-supplement overall,” Masterson says. “But creatine is one where there are no known side effects, and it’s pretty cheap. Will it drastically change someone? No, but it could give you more energy for exercise or even provide more oomph as you’re trying to get out of a chair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="IE7DIX3Y5JHS7GHE2JWWDYXWM4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="IE7DIX3Y5JHS7GHE2JWWDYXWM4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The importance of strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UIXS4T3OTJG6TG26T7KBGMDTCY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s no getting around the fact that exercise is crucial for your muscles. But that doesn’t mean you have to take up bodybuilding to get stronger in your 60s, 70s and beyond. Activities like walking and simple &lt;a href="http://cr.org/4strength" target="_blank"&gt;strength-training&lt;/a&gt; moves such as chair squats (repeatedly sitting and standing) and wall push-ups — and just being active and moving more in general — are a good way to preserve muscle and keep bones and joints strong, Masterson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KVHCJMREWFCDJEQKMKIJQX6PQM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you want to go further, you can find weight-focused classes that use dumbbells or other simple equipment at gyms or community recreation centers, or online. (Check out the &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/@nihaging" target="_blank"&gt;workout videos from the National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;.) Try to time your workouts so you’ll be having a meal or snack within a few hours afterward, Masterson says. Both exercise and eating protein stimulate muscle development, so combining them will lead to greater effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

For men, it’s 30 grams daily. “Most people only get about half of the recommended amount of fiber each day,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fiber is found only in plant-based foods, and there are five main groups that provide it: vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, and nuts and seeds. Of these, legumes pack the biggest punch. Just one cup of beans contains 10 to 19 grams of fiber, which can get you more than halfway to your daily target. “Animal foods don’t contain fiber, so an eating pattern that’s disproportionately high in meat, dairy and eggs is more likely to fall short on fiber,” said registered dietitian &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.diabetesteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Avery Zenker" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab117e4b0744e1d5aa708" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.diabetesteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avery Zenker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The health benefits of fiber:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fiber supports healthy digestion, helps regulate blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and promotes a sense of fullness that can aid in appetite and weight management. It’s also linked to a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain cancers, including colorectal and colon, Zenker noted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Low fiber diets are linked to microbiome imbalances and lower microbial diversity, both of which are associated with increased risk of inflammatory diseases.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Different types of fiber offer different benefits. “Soluble fiber helps regulate blood sugar and lower cholesterol — great for patients with diabetes or heart disease risk,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bespokeconciergemd.com/providers/dr-michael-ednie" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Michael Ednie" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab117e4b0744e1d5aa708" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.bespokeconciergemd.com/providers/dr-michael-ednie" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Michael Ednie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, founder of Bespoke Concierge MD based in Scottsdale, Arizona. This type of fiber dissolves in water to form a gel that helps lower cholesterol and regulate blood sugar. “Insoluble fiber promotes regularity and helps prevent constipation, which is crucial for colon health,” Ednie said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then there’s prebiotic fiber, which serves as food for the beneficial bacteria in your gut. “As those bacteria ferment prebiotic fibers, they produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, which have anti-inflammatory effects and support gut barrier function. Prebiotics have also been linked to improved mineral absorption and even mood regulation via the gut-brain connection,” Ednie said. Garlic, onions, bananas and asparagus are all excellent sources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: The Good Brigade via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;The Good Brigade via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Just one cup of beans contains 10 to 19 grams of fiber, which can get you more than halfway to your daily target.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just like variety in your overall diet supports better nutrition, eating different types of fiber helps build a healthier, more resilient gut microbiome. “Different fibers feed different strains of beneficial bacteria, which leads to better gut health, stronger immune function and lower inflammation overall,” Ednie explained. While there’s no strict formula for how much of each fiber type you need, he suggests aiming for about two-thirds insoluble fiber and one-third soluble fiber.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibermaxxing can backfire on your digestive system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While there’s no official upper limit for fiber intake, increasing it too quickly can cause gas, bloating and other digestive issues like cramping, constipation and diarrhea. “The gut bacteria essentially go into overdrive trying to process the sudden influx of fiber, producing excess gas as a byproduct,” Ednie explained. “In rare cases, if someone dramatically increases fiber without proper hydration or pacing, it can even lead to intestinal blockages that require medical attention.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The type of fiber you’re increasing also affects the symptoms you may experience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Soluble fiber — found in foods like oats, apples and beans — tends to be gentler at first but often causes more gas because it’s fermented by gut bacteria,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ednie said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Insoluble fiber — from whole grains, vegetable skins and nuts — adds bulk and moves things along but can lead to more bloating and cramping if increased too quickly without enough water.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zenker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; also notes that for some people, especially older adults and young children, the satiating effect of fiber may reduce overall food intake, potentially leading to unintended weight loss or nutrient gaps. Additionally, consuming too much fiber can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/13/2641" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="interfere with the absorption of important minerals" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685ab117e4b0744e1d5aa708" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/13/2641" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;interfere with the absorption of important minerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; like iron, zinc and calcium by binding to them in the gut and preventing their absorption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing your fluid intake is key.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hydration is essential when increasing fiber intake to help it do its job effectively. “Soluble fiber needs water to form the gel that helps regulate blood sugar and cholesterol,” Ednie explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Insoluble fiber needs water to add bulk and move stool efficiently through the digestive tract.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He recommends aiming for at least eight to 10 cups of water a day when boosting your fiber intake, and more if you’re active or in a hot climate, and pairing every fiber-rich meal or snack with a full glass of water to support digestion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

He also recommends spreading your fiber intake throughout the day, like enjoying oatmeal with berries in the morning, veggies or legumes at lunch and dinner, and snacks like fruit with nuts or popcorn in between. “Consistency makes it much easier for the body to adapt and helps create sustainable habits that support long-term gut health,” he added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ednie also emphasizes prioritizing whole foods as your main fiber source to support digestive, metabolic and cardiovascular health. These foods naturally contain a mix of soluble and insoluble fiber, along with vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients that fiber supplements don’t offer. “Supplements can be helpful for people who struggle to meet their fiber needs through diet alone, but they should be viewed as an addition, not a replacement,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQajRualdmR3d1LXoxSEJlQUU5dmZrNG5tTjhKaFVncHRLWmVXTV84NzZURGg2NnBsREtBaGNUUnM4bXZGSFNzcWJpb21WOWRDMlMzNkdWYWJ0SUVaWmRES3BlWEpBX0tXYkxTeF9SU2R3enZvWWFCT0V0WDBoWmF0TWtnN0hvbE11QjB1VTMwY9IBlAFBVV95cUxONWpQNHBiX3pfMm1PXzVCb0xoaW5kYWdYQWdVeENaVDZzSXhpbXN0Z0ZYMTAteDc0NE9CVzVLNXBfNnR5QkpPUWx5V1dfdlZzZ1dKeGhxQWJOWGpCRUtqSDF3V0k1ZHJCNjFOaEMzWnNzOFJLRUtJdmxORFVMRXYwaDg3Tk5Vb3N2dVdBTkRYNGt3a3Bu</guid></item><item><title>40岁后大脑健康的最佳食物- HuffPost | The Best Foods For Your Brain Health After Age 40 - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPN1lNT0JBWTVKTE1IMGNPX3RYb2p4ZU5LNk9KWlNmSDNQYUFEVm9Xbm1QV3M1X1loZ3hVTWhfQ0htalBUeV9zc0NFdTNXNTFuQ3ZqcHpXZkJKTVNMZDBUZXJNTG9lYmRPV1NibS1US2pVLUVsWUc0UE9yd19JYzludFB6Xy1iNlBOSG9vNWhwX1NKX0RlbDhLR2JNdEFtdWPSAaQBQVVfeXFMTU5TSDU2am53MDJ3b1pPdmtvT0ZwR3R4Q2ZmMHp4aG1YektIVW9iVjZEUnk3dkdyd2xBbVh1dkxxZGF3Qk9ZTC0yaUp5bUNjZWNHMXZ0OFVPSlVVTjgtbHVSU05XcmRsMVlHeVd6ZEMwOXBHZTRETmVqdWVTUTR6WDlBZVJtdGhoWldtOG9ydzNsa2xiTWRJaTB3YjdPYWgyT19ULUs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most people over 40, I’ve noticed that my memory can sometimes be a little sluggish, and my mind doesn’t always seem to be as quick and sharp as it was when I was, say, in my 20s.

Manaker says this kind of tea is a natural source of antioxidants like catechins and flavonoids, which help protect brain cells from oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, she notes, true tea contains L-theanine — an amino acid that helps you relax without feeling drowsy — and caffeine, which enhances alertness and cognitive performance. “Together, these elements may support focus, memory, and overall mental clarity.” Studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10655233/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="have shown" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6850192fe4b0dd6cd17e1a31" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10655233/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;have shown&lt;/a&gt; that frequent tea consumption, particularly drinking green tea, can have a positive cognitive effect on older people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walnuts &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Manaker says it’s fitting that walnuts look somewhat like tiny brains — take it as a hint from Mother Nature that this tree nut is good for our brain. “Walnuts are often hailed as a superfood for brain health due to the nutrients they naturally contain, including antioxidants and magnesium,” Manaker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walnuts are the only tree nut that is an excellent source of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="ALA omega-3 fatty acids" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6850192fe4b0dd6cd17e1a31" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ALA omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Manaker said, adding that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dad2.12596" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="data shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6850192fe4b0dd6cd17e1a31" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dad2.12596" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;data shows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that higher levels of ALA in the blood were linked to better energy usage in brain regions typically affected in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).

    &lt;p&gt;Some workouts feel like an act of defiance. There are days when the world doesn’t want you to take any time for yourself, when it wants all of you, every atom: in meetings, supermarkets, traffic jams, dropping children off at football practice, delivering relatives you don’t even like to dental hygienist appointments they probably don’t even need. This is where &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/workouts/best-10-minute-workouts-at-home-exercises-2022/"&gt;the 10-minute workout&lt;/a&gt; rides to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/workouts/micro-exercises/"&gt;short bursts of exercise can be extremely effective&lt;/a&gt; and, depending on your goals, better than more protracted sessions. A review of the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527142/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; carried out in the United States found that 10 minutes of exercise can be beneficial across measures including longevity: “Physical activity accumulated in bouts that are 10 minutes is associated with favourable health-related outcomes, including all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile a Norwegian &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9557220/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that two short bursts of resistance could be more effective than a single long session. The study looked at women who trained regularly and found they felt the long session was more enjoyable and valid but, in reality, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/workouts/five-minute-exercises-heart/"&gt;shorter, more intense workouts&lt;/a&gt; enabled them to achieve more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Scott, an exercise physiologist and senior lecturer at Portsmouth University, says: “People can get the same fitness benefit from shorter sessions as longer, purposeful exercise.” In other words, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/walking/steps-to-lose-weight/"&gt;even walking up the stairs counts&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have to be an activity defined as a workout at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/strength-training/"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;, in the past I used the kind of workouts bodybuilders recommended. These were very much the War and Peace of resistance training and seemed to take up most of my teen Saturdays. Totally unnecessary says, Scott: “It doesn’t have be multiple sets of the same exercise, one good quality set per exercise, especially for resistance training novices, can be at least as beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For heart and lung health, multiple short sessions can also be at least as good as a single longer bursts of movement. “Three 10-minute bursts of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/walking/health-benefits-of-walking/"&gt;brisk walking&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to a single walk of 30 minutes, deliver the same, if not more benefits for body composition and glucose control,” Scott notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a trade-off between intensity and duration – so if you are sufficiently healthy and able, you can give your body 10 minutes of serious, strenuous exercise, deliver Aunt Virginia to the dentist, and still reap the kind of rewards you’d expect from a much more time-consuming &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/workouts/the-home-workout-that-can-burn-up-to-800-calories/"&gt;workout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The workout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a 10-minute whole-body workout that does pretty much everything you need. It’s been designed by Samuel Quinn, the personal training lead at Nuffield Health gym group. He says: “There is a combination of exercises that will increase cardiovascular fitness whilst &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/lose-belly-fat-exercise-diet-best-ways"&gt;burning body fat&lt;/a&gt;, improve upper body, lower body and core strength, whilst improving explosiveness and power. This will also help to improve mobility, stability and balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has carefully divided the work between strength and cardio. “Of the 10 exercises, four are cardio focused and six are strength-based, however many will benefit both. This workout is to be performed two to three times per week and is perfect for building strength and cardiovascular fitness whilst improving mobility and athletic performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perform each exercise for one minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;1. Bear crawl&lt;/h2&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;New Englanders are used to dealing with a vast assortment of ticks, including Lone Star ticks, deer ticks that carry Lyme disease, and American dog ticks that can transmit Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. But this season is shaping up to be a particularly bad one, with a surge of tick-borne diseases and tick exposures across the country, especially in the Northeast. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In June, visits to emergency rooms for tick bites reached their highest levels in at least five years in New England and other nearby states, according to data from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-research/facts-stats/tick-bite-data-tracker.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-research/facts-stats/tick-bite-data-tracker.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, 233 out of 100,000 ER visits in the Northeast were for tick bites, nearly double the national average of 118. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The trend is similar in Massachusetts. According to monthly records published by the state’s department of public health, &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/lists/monthly-tick-borne-disease-reports#2025-" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/lists/monthly-tick-borne-disease-reports#2025-"&gt;more than 0.6 percent&lt;/a&gt; of visits to an emergency department in May were for tick exposure, up from around 0.4 percent from 2022 to 2024. Visits typically peak in July. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Massachusetts State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine Brown said that although the data doesn’t capture visits to urgent care and primary care providers for tick exposure, it points to a real increase in interactions between ticks and humans in the state. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This year is definitely an outlier for us,” Brown said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Thomas Mather, director of the University of Rhode Island’s Center for Vector-Borne Diseases, said that higher levels of tick-borne diseases in New England are mostly caused by higher numbers of blacklegged, or deer tick, nymphs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The nymphs are around the size of a poppy seed, and about 20 percent of them in the New England region carry Lyme, Mather said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;They thrive in humid weather. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s not related to how warm it is in the winter … if it’s dry in the early spring when they first emerge, they start dying,” Mather said. “Whenever there were low-humidity episodes early in the season in late May and early June, we always had fewer ticks and fewer disease cases.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;All in all, New England is seeing more humidity in the spring and summer now compared to the previous two decades, said Ken Mahan, the Globe’s lead meteorologist.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;This is a direct result of a warming atmosphere because warmer temperatures hold more moisture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“When dew points push above 65, that’s when a big change in available moisture can be felt,” said Mahan. “[There has been an] increasing trend in the number of 70-degree dew point days across Boston over the years.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Deer tick populations are also positively correlated with the populations of small rodents and deer, the animals that serve as their most important food sources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Mather said that the migration of Lone Star ticks, which were formerly common only in the South, over the past five years has been the biggest change in the trend of tick-borne diseases in New England. Mather runs an &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/tickspotters/submit/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/tickspotters/submit/"&gt;online project called TickSpotter&lt;/a&gt; where people across the country can send in photos of ticks they encounter so that his team of scientists can identify what kind of tick it is. Data from TickSpotter showed a more than 300 percent increase in people encountering these ticks in the past three years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts are right on the edge of the northward expansion of these ticks … Martha’s Vineyard and Narragansett Bay are completely infested with them,” Mather said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Allison Cameron Parry, a professional bodybuilder and mother of two who lives on Martha’s Vineyard, said that almost everyone in her family has Alpha-gal. After giving up meat and dairy, she has had to work harder to supplement those nutrients, which are necessary for her athletic training. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Cameron Parry also said she was worried about her 3-year-old son playing outside. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Long grass literally gives me anxiety … We use a natural spray in our yard, because I have a young child. Unfortunately, the smaller the child, the bigger the risk, because they don’t know to stay out of the bush,” Cameron Parry said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At a virtual panel held by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health last week, experts from Harvard and Boston University spoke about preventing tick-borne diseases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Richard Pollack, senior environmental public health officer at Harvard University, recommended that people treat their clothes with permethrin, an EPA-registered tick repellent derived from an ingredient&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;found in chrysanthemums. Pollack also advised people to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/after-a-tick-bite/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/after-a-tick-bite/index.html"&gt;pull ticks off of their skin&lt;/a&gt; as soon as they notice them, because ticks attached for 24 to 36 hours can transmit the infection that causes Lyme disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You don’t necessarily need to go to the emergency room to have somebody pull the tick off. You might be sitting for six hours, in some cases, before you’re actually seen,” Pollack said. “So just pull the tick off, save it, and then you can delve into what it was later.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Daniel Solomon, infectious disease specialist at Mass General Brigham, recommends that people take the antibiotic doxycycline within 72 hours of removing a tick that was attached to their skin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“By the book, the CDC would say that the tick needs to be attached for 36 hours or more [for a patient to take the antibiotic], but we don’t know when ticks attach,” Solomon said. “So if there’s a tick attached, it’s plausible that it could have been on there for a day or more, so take a single dose of doxycycline.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Brown, the state epidemiologist,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;said the increase in tick exposure should not discourage people from enjoying the outdoors. She recommended people use tick repellents, wear light-colored, long-sleeved clothing so it’s easier to spot and remove ticks, and put their clothes in the dryer on high heat after returning home to kill ticks that are hard to see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For pets, Pollack said that there were oral medications for dogs as well as topical ointments that can be applied at the back of the neck once a month to prevent tick bites. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Patrick and Lily Marvin of Topsfield have three golden retrievers and have noticed more ticks on their dogs this summer when they go for hikes in Beverly. Two summers ago in Nantucket, one of the dogs, Kevin, contracted Lyme disease despite wearing a medicated collar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“He was lethargic, didn’t want to eat, and would cry whenever we gave him antibiotics,” Patrick said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He has since recovered, and the Marvins have been proactive about giving their dogs chewable tablets to keep them safe from ticks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The speakers at the panel also noted that there are vaccines in the works to fight tick-borne diseases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/about/lyme-disease-vaccine.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Lyme disease vaccine developed&lt;/a&gt; by Valneva and Pfizer is in late-stage clinical trials. The University of Massachusetts Medical School’s MassBiologics has also developed an antibody designed to be used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for Lyme disease, but human trials haven’t begun yet. A Lyme disease vaccine called LYMERix had been approved by the FDA in 1998 but was discontinued in 2002 because of a lack of consumer demand. There isn’t a prophylaxis being developed for Alpha-gal yet, though &lt;a href="https://che.engin.umich.edu/2024/08/12/tick-borne-red-meat-allergy-prevented-in-mice-through-new-nanoparticle-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://che.engin.umich.edu/2024/08/12/tick-borne-red-meat-allergy-prevented-in-mice-through-new-nanoparticle-treatment/"&gt;University of Michigan scientists&lt;/a&gt; tested a nanoparticle treatment that successfully reduced allergies in mice bitten by Lone Star ticks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This is welcome news to McCormack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Ticks are scary because they’re so small and they carry such life-altering diseases,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Fortunately, lengthy sessions at the &lt;a href="/topic/gym"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; aren’t a prerequisite of a successful and sustainable &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you spend most of your days sitting at a &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/house-garden/furniture/best-standing-desks-a9371281.html"&gt;desk&lt;/a&gt; and struggling to find time to move, “exercise snacking” could be the perfect solution. This fitness trend involves committing to a few short bouts of activity throughout the day – think a snack, instead of a full meal – and it offers plenty of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small study conducted by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/21/14597"&gt;University of Essex&lt;/a&gt; found that just 16 minutes of bodyweight exercises like &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt; and lunges, spread across a standard eight-hour work day, helped subjects strengthen their muscles and boost their balance over the course of four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a 2022 article, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.lww.com%2Facsm-essr%2Ffulltext%2F2022%2F01000%2Fexercise_snacks__a_novel_strategy_to_improve.5.aspx&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;Exercise and Sport Sciences Review&lt;/a&gt;, found positive impacts from even shorter bursts of activity – namely, 15-30 seconds of vigorous-intensity exercises such as &lt;a href="/sport/cycling"&gt;cycling&lt;/a&gt; or stair climbing, three times per day. It concluded that this strategy was effective at “improving cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise performance in inactive adults”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, treating your workouts like little snacks throughout your day, rather than a full hour-long gym session, could improve your strength, flexibility and longevity dramatically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that impressive list of benefits has piqued your interest, read on. Below, we speak to three experts on &lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;, stretching and &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training?CMP=ILC-refresh"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;, and task each with sharing a few simple exercise snacking ideas for &lt;em&gt;Independent &lt;/em&gt;readers to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make conscious choices to increase your daily activity levels, such as using the stairs rather than a lift, or picking a parking spot further away from your office. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try picking up the pace while walking for greater potential health benefits. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, a walk is the ideal way to keep fit. It’s cheap, easy to do and boasts a raft of benefits. It’s also a great option if you want to jump on the exercise snacking trend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a good general recommendation for anyone to exercise throughout the day,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://news.ua.edu/ua-theme-expert/elroy-joseph-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of exercise science at &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ua.edu%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CHarry.Bullmore%40independent.co.uk%7C737bf0e8fbee4162e11708dcc6b51171%7C0f3a4c644dc54a768d4152d85ca158a5%7C0%7C0%7C638603728215436465%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=HQCZVfDiIGFM%2FhVz7b%2BNiSdc0NBKy3E%2FJumsFAwHQYQ%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;The University of Alabama&lt;/a&gt; with a specialism in all things step-based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some new research that’s come out in the last couple of years is actually saying that sedentary time, sitting down for long periods, &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be offset by doing large amounts of exercise. But ideally you should have less sedentary time and lower amounts of aerobic or resistance training exercise [throughout the day]. That’s the ideal combination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the most accessible ways to do this: you don’t need any equipment, and you can do it pretty much anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need to think about those breaks in sedentary time as ‘exercise’, it’s more like purposeful movement in between bouts of doing things,” advises Dr Aguiar. “For example, parking your car a little bit further away than the car park that’s immediately by your office, or using public transport and getting off one stop early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s more about thinking of activity as a choice throughout the day: building in movement wherever possible rather than thinking ‘I have to have an hour to exercise, otherwise I’m not doing any’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His second piece of advice is to be mindful of the intensity of this purposeful movement. If you’re walking, that might mean picking up the pace slightly – &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31698337/"&gt;Dr Aguiar’s research&lt;/a&gt; points to a cadence of 100 steps per minute being representative of moderate-intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, and promises “significant physical and mental health benefits from regular exercise”. If you can chip away at this target with a brisk walk a few times each day, you’ll be well on your way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, try incorporating a few faster-paced walks into your day to enjoy health perks such as increased energy expenditure and improved cardiovascular fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a short circuit of compound (multi-muscle) bodyweight exercises such as squats, lunges and press-ups into your work day. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try to work all of the major muscle groups (the chest, back, shoulders, arms, legs and core) at least a couple of times per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training lays the foundations of a fit and functional body, not only helping you build strength and muscle, but also increasing your mobility, bone density and joint health to minimise injury risk. And you don’t need to pump iron for hours on end to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people believe you need a 60-minute-plus session to feel the benefits of exercise, but nothing could be further from the truth,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/raquel_skorchio/"&gt;Raquel Sanjurjo&lt;/a&gt;, a gym-owner and personal trainer with more than a decade of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies show that as long as there is enough stimulus across the week, your strength and muscle will increase. It doesn’t matter if you do it in a 90-minute window or in 10-minute blocks spread throughout the day. Just try to hit all of the muscle groups [the chest, back, shoulders, arms, legs and core] for four to eight sets each week, then get ready for the gains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanjurjo recommends using the routine below when you’re short on time and don’t have any equipment to hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In five minutes, complete as many rounds as possible of the circuit below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Squat x10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit-up x10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jumping lunge x10 (five on each side) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press-up x5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can’t perform a press-up, you can make this exercise easier by placing your hands on an elevated surface like a sturdy chair or your desk. You can also swap the jumping lunges for standard lunges if you prefer low-impact workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stretching&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find a five-minute stretching routine you can do anywhere without any specialist equipment. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you sit down a lot during the day, try to break up sedentary periods with this stretching routine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a more relaxed way to add some extra movement into your day, stretching is a top option. Stretching can also help with mobility later in life and help you maintain more independence as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, the biggest benefit they’re going to get from stretching is that feeling of losing restriction and [gaining that] freedom to be able to move,” says flexibility expert and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@BodyweightWarrior"&gt;Bodyweight Warrior&lt;/a&gt; founder Tom Merrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sedentary lifestyle can have the opposite effect, leading to a downturn in flexibility, according to the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/a-flexible-way-to-stretch#:~:text=Your%20muscles%20shrink%20and%20your,get%20tighter%2C%22%20says%20Dr."&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt; so if you can make short stretching sessions a part of your exercise snacking routine, you’ll reap the rewards for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re sitting a lot in the day, you’re going to get some compression and tightness of the glutes, and they then have an impact on other lower body positions like the squat,” Merrick says. “Loosening the hips really helps to unlock things. The hip flexors tend to be tight on a lot of people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the clip below, he shares &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@BodyweightWarrior"&gt;five stretches he does every day&lt;/a&gt;. There are two to specifically target the hips – the couch stretch and 90/90 – and this pair can be done pretty much anywhere. The squat and elephant walk are accessible too, loosening tight hips and hamstrings, but you’ll need a pull-up bar to perform the hang for healthier shoulders and decompression of the spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try holding each stretch for 60 seconds for some respite from your usual posture at your desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 lnUWhb eNfKwA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use exercise snacking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise snacking is a great way to introduce more movement into your day, especially if you’re someone who struggles to find time to work out. Above, you’ll find all the ingredients you need to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main appeal of exercise snacking is its accessibility – there’s no point committing to an itinerary you know you won’t stick to. Instead, start with just one or two short bouts of exercise per day, prioritising things that are achievable, enjoyable and make you feel good – this is the key to making an exercise plan stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re consistently completing these sessions, you can slowly try adding more in, with the end goal of hitting the 150-minutes of moderate-intensity activity (or 75-minutes of vigorous-intensity activity) per week championed by the WHO and NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there you have it, a bite-sized answer to your workout woes and a great place to start if you’re new to exercise, or getting back into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/what-is-interval-training-benefits-b2578756.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is interval training and is it right for everyone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 09:17:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNdFk1TVltbXRaQmU1VGlUSEpRaFUzZkZzcEUzcE8zSHpKX2EtMnUxTWFZYVRmR2NMWGdEQ3FSSElyMGtMVnVfYWJwYmdPZmpHMjRXd1lkdFJoNkR6eEVHVlJxWnVSd2w3MkdIUnpjMVJneFRuaEdpdXhKQjBvTV9qcDE4NXZKRkVyN0pqLW5ZN1hub1k</guid></item><item><title>“我是一名神经病学家–这种常见的睡眠习惯可能会增加痴呆症风险” -英国赫芬顿邮报 | 'I'm A Neurologist – This Common Sleep Habit May Raise Dementia Risk' - HuffPost UK</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/minimum-hours-sleep-dementia-prevention_uk_668ba644e4b07ef2c8177b4d" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Getting enough sleep" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="686b8260e4b0f186b60de7af" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="668ba644e4b07ef2c8177b4d" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt;, especially in midlife, has been linked to a decreased risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even something as seemingly trivial as &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/nightmares-dementia-risk_uk_67321dd1e4b0231a203b1c58" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="having more nightmares" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="686b8260e4b0f186b60de7af" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67321dd1e4b0231a203b1c58" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;having more nightmares&lt;/a&gt;

Additionally, we wake up our muscles, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stimulate the brain&lt;/a&gt; and prepare to take on the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The sleep-exercise balance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep and wellness expert Todd Anderson, co-founder of Dream Performance &amp;amp; Recovery in Nashville, Tennessee, emphasized the importance of striking a healthy balance between &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;exercise and rest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;22The first couple hours of exercise in a week are "insanely impactful," Anderson said — and it doesn’t have to be strenuous activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The balance between sleep and rest is important for results, experts say.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our bodies are meant to move," he said. "Getting two hours of movement or exercise in a week should be very high on the priority list."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it might seem that morning exercise is cutting into sleep time, Anderson pointed out that regular exercise could actually result in a higher quality of slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sleep you're getting will be more impactful," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"Getting two hours of movement or exercise in a week should be very high on the priority list."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for people who hit the gym daily and don't get sufficient shuteye, Anderson said he considers it a "no-brainer" to opt for &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt; over an early-morning workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it comes down to body composition and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; or just fitness in general, you'll probably have a better outcome from that hour of sleep when you're already at a pretty decent level of activity," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you sleep, it allows you to respond effectively to the stress from the workouts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For people who hit the gym daily and don't get sufficient shuteye, one expert said he considers it a "no-brainer" to opt for adequate sleep over an early-morning workout.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosca agreed that proper rest and recovery requires seven to eight hours of sleep, which allows the muscles to have the greatest amount of repair and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If someone is going to bed at 12 a.m. to 1 a.m. nightly and then trying to wake up for a 6 a.m. workout, the progress will stall and the effects of the hard work that is put in will take that much longer to come to light," she told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting on a regular sleep schedule, unwinding earlier, putting the electronics down and focusing on calming the mind will allow someone to recover faster, have more energy in the morning, and release those happy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain chemicals&lt;/a&gt; that make us feel accomplished."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proper rest and recovery requires seven to eight hours of sleep, which allows the muscles have the greatest amount of repair and growth, an expert said.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trainer stressed that morning workouts are not for everyone, and there are certain factors that can prevent success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those considering a morning workout, Mosca recommends that they ask themselves the following questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did I get enough sleep the night before?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How was my &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nutritional intake&lt;/a&gt;?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Am I overly stressed?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do I keep hitting snooze when the alarm goes off?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Snoozing your alarm consistently might be a sign to prioritize sleep over your morning workout.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we find that the answers to those questions [aren't] on the positive side, consider an afternoon mini-workout: 15 to 20 minutes after work or on break, to get the muscles moving and stimulated," Mosca suggested as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The body adjusts the more that it moves and the more it is in a consistent routine. Taking the right steps to change the routine is crucial, so we don’t overload the body all at once."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosca reiterated that sleep and recovery play a "crucial role" in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fitness journey success&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we shorten the timeframe for our bodies to recover, they will constantly be trying to play catch-up, but never reaching that finish line," she said.

Prevalence varies by region, with rates above 40% in the Americas and Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver, not caused by heavy alcohol consumption. It's often linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of conditions, from simple fat buildup (NAFL) to more serious inflammation and scarring (NASH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often termed the "silent epidemic," NAFLD is often symptomless in its early stages. However, the liver’s strained function can manifest surprisingly on your face. Subtle signs like puffiness, discoloration, dryness, and rashes may seem cosmetic, but they often signal deeper metabolic or inflammatory processes. Recognizing early indicators of fatty liver disease allows you to read the warning signals and seek timely medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1.

This results in capillary leakage and fluid buildup, causing puffiness, particularly around the eyes and cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Health note:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If puffiness persists despite normal sleep, low salt intake, and good hydration, consider checking liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Skin discoloration: Yellowing, dark circles, and spider veins&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Yellow tint (Jaundice)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Observation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A yellow hue in the skin or the whites of your eyes. This is known as jaundice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Underlying cause:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bilirubin, a breakdown product of red blood cells, accumulates when the liver cannot process it effectively – a hallmark of advanced liver dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dark circles and hyperpigmentation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Observation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Persistent dark under‑eye circles or dusky patches, even with adequate rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Possible cause:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toxin accumulation and impaired blood filtration due to liver strain can manifest as persistent dark circles. Insulin resistance – a common feature of NAFLD – can also cause acanthosis nigricans in skin folds like the neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spider veins and rosacea&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Observation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Small red lines (spider angiomas) across the cheeks or nose, or facial redness that’s blotchy and persistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why it shows:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Impaired estrogen breakdown in liver disease increases blood flow to superficial vessels, causing spider veins. Additionally, inflammatory conditions like rosacea are linked to fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Acne, oiliness, and mouth rashes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Observation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unexpected adult acne, oilier skin, especially around the chin or jawline, and rashes or bumps around the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Connection:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Acne and oily skin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the liver’s detox and hormone regulation falter, androgen and toxin levels build up, leading to hormonal acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Perioral rash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chronic zinc deficiency – common in NAFLD – can trigger dermatitis around the mouth, visible as small fluid- or solid-filled bumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Itching, dryness, and an itchy rash&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Observation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Constant itching or dryness on the face and facial skin rashes that don’t resolve with usual skincare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Medical insight:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itching (pruritus) is often due to bile salt buildup when liver excretory function is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dry red patches/rash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Linked to both nutrient deficiencies and toxin retention.

When overwhelmed – by fat, toxins, or insulin resistance – its inability to filter effectively shows externally. Facial skin, highly visible and sensitive, becomes an early signal. Recognizing these signs allows for proactive intervention through diet, exercise, and medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your face is more than the reflection of your beauty – it can forewarn about your liver. Listen to your skin’s signals, get evaluated, and embrace lifestyle changes early. Early recognition can prompt action – medical guidance, lifestyle adjustments, and targeted nutrition – that often reverses fatty liver and restores both internal health and skin vitality. So, next time you take a close look standing in front of the mirror, listen to your skin – it might be protecting your liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; This article is for informational purposes only and does not substitute professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Convenience and accessibility are two essential ingredients in any effective workout regimen, ensuring you’re able to stay the course and see long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what online trainer Rachael Sacerdoti is serving up with her new 14-Day Mini Movement Challenge launching on Monday, July 7 on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/itssosimple_rs" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/itssosimple_rs" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;her Instagram channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’ll be sharing a quickfire workout every day for two weeks to help you build consistent, sustainable habits with nothing more than your bodyweight. Each routine takes just 60 seconds—and can be done while waiting for the kettle to boil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This 14-day challenge is perfect if you’re short on time but want to feel stronger, more energized and more in control of your day,” she tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No gym. No equipment. Just you and one minute of movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One minute of daily exercise might not transform your physique and fitness overnight, but research suggests that even short bursts of vigorous movement can lead to serious long-term health results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/5/316?rss=1" target="_blank" data-url="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/5/316?rss=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which found ultra-short doses of vigorous physical activity—between an average of 1.5 to 4 minutes a day—can be enough to halve cardiovascular risk in middle-aged women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-vPnb2YHgunXhpvV9FzfL46" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-vPnb2YHgunXhpvV9FzfL46 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-this-60-second-fitness-challenge-builds-good-habits"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How this 60-second fitness challenge builds good habits &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacerdoti is keen to stress that this challenge isn’t about quick fixes and shortcuts. Instead, she says, it’s about consistency, confidence and momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Life is full. Most of us are juggling work, family and everything in between,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea of carving out 45 minutes for a workout can feel impossible some days. But movement doesn’t have to be all or nothing and this challenge is here to prove that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple benefits, she adds, but primarily the challenge will build and reinforce healthy habits that you can sustain without relying on motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Each workout will] also give your brain and body an instant energy and mood boost, while building confidence through movement repetition, helping you perfect your form.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day one features four moves: a squat to punch, jumping jacks, standing cross-body crunches and high knees. Perform each move for 15 seconds and you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For added accountability, Sacerdoti encourages you to invite a friend or housemate to join you in the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we’re all about keeping things simple, this challenge is here to help people move their bodies daily in a way that feels doable,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can find just 60 seconds while your coffee brews, you can start building a habit that sticks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that regular walking is good for us, but information around step count goals can sometimes be confusing. Most people have heard of the 10,000 steps a day target by now, but a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2022 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that you can get significant health benefits from fewer steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which may leave you wondering, is there a lower limit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there are walking experts like Milica McDowell, a doctor of physical therapy, exercise physiologist, and VP of operations for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gaithappens.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://gaithappens.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Gait Happens&lt;/a&gt;, who are more than happy to share their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell outlined the figures for me and explained why you should be worried if you’re walking fewer than 2,500 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell’s advice is based on findings from a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2023 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; that appeared in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.&lt;/em&gt; The research collected data from more than 250,000 participants over multiple years, meaning the findings can be reliably used to make informed recommendations by experts like McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this information motivates you to walk more to regularly hit that minimum, that’s great, but just make sure to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in"&gt;increase your step count safely&lt;/a&gt;—building up slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-2-500-steps"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why 2,500 steps?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; mentioned above explains that you need to walk a minimum of 2,500-4,000 steps a day to see a reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GgGtB3NtSUZj35XNFS3srY" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GgGtB3NtSUZj35XNFS3srY slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2,337 steps a day, the risk of cardiovascular mortality specifically begins to reduce, so McDowell rounds that up to a more memorable 2,500 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular mortality encompasses all deaths caused by diseases of the cardiovascular system—your heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re walking fewer than 2,500 steps a day, your risk of heart disease, stroke and cardiovascular events is increased. Over 2,500 steps, those risks begin to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“2,500 is the utter basement. If you’re lower than that, you are at risk for all sorts of horrible things,” says McDowell. “So, please get above 2,500. Most people take about 100 steps per minute, so 2,500 is roughly 25 minutes of walking per day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that all steps count—even getting something from another room—and this ambient walking, as it known, quickly adds up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-many-steps-should-you-aim-for"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How many steps should you aim for?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images / sdominick)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="3-000-to-4-000-steps-3"&gt;3,000 to 4,000 steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If 2,500 is the absolute basement and you increase by 500 steps per day to 3,000, your risk of dying goes down 7%,” says McDowell. “If you go up 1,000 steps a day, from 2,500 to 3,500, you reduce your risk of dying by 15%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; states that from around 3,867 steps a day, the risk of mortality from all causes&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;begins to reduce. This includes deaths from any illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5-000-steps-3"&gt;5,000 steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything under 5,000 steps a day is considered sedentary, with 5,000 to 7,500 classed as low activity. Other benefits kick in at 5,000, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that when we hit that 5,000 step mark, it’s very good for managing depression symptoms,” says McDowell. “So if you have a family history or if you’ve struggled with those conditions in the past, there are prescriptive amounts of walking that can reduce the symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://publichealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e48355/" target="_blank" data-url="https://publichealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e48355/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2024 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;JMIR Public Health and Surveillance&lt;/em&gt; found that walking can be used as “an evidence-based intervention for reducing anxiety and depression.” You might not be able to add walking to your list of medications, but a higher step count could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s an important message because we know that anxiety, depression, and a lot of mental health disorders impact people’s longevity,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6-000-to-8-000-steps-3"&gt;6,000 to 8,000 steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re older than 60, you should be aiming for between 6,000 and 8,000 steps a day for optimal health and longevity, after which the benefits stop increasing with the number of steps you walk. This recommendation is based on data from a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2022 &lt;em&gt;Lancet &lt;/em&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; exploring the benefits of walking for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you hit around the 7,000 mark, it’s good for reducing your risk of developing depression in the first place,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="8-000-to-10-000-steps-3"&gt;8,000 to 10,000 steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are under 60 years old, the point of diminishing returns mentioned earlier is slightly higher, between 8,000 and 10,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking 8,000 steps at a moderate pace (about 3mph) will take you about 90 minutes to walk, depending on your stride length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, you don’t have to do that 90 minutes all in one go: you can break it up into smaller chunks like three 30-minute walks or three 20-minute walks and one 30-minute walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-walk-more"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to walk more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked McDowell for her top tip to squeeze more steps into a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I encourage people to do micro walks,” she says. “They can go out for five minutes because most people walk at 100 steps per minute. So even five minutes can make a significant difference. And if we get them to add 10 minutes a day consistently, we’re looking at a significant impact on their longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-if-i-do-other-cardio-should-i-still-walk-for-health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If I do other cardio should I still walk for health? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of my colleagues do other forms of exercise, and I wondered if doing more cardio exercise means you can skip hitting your steps that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rowing, biking and swimming are all good for you, but they don’t provide the specific &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking"&gt;benefits of walking&lt;/a&gt;. They surely provide other benefits, but your body needs a certain number of steps per day to achieve optimal health,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-shop-walking-shoes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shop walking shoes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're in need of a new pair of walking shoes, our guide to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking"&gt;best walking shoes&lt;/a&gt; can help.

							&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that kids today are not all right. Youth rates of &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-11-07/rates-of-anxiety-depression-rising-among-americans-especially-the-young" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/articles/2024/12/eating-disorders-among-kids-are-on-the-rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/mental-health/3806794-most-teenagers-exposed-to-online-pornography-by-age-13-survey/#:~:text=The%20average%20age%20of%20exposure%20to%20online%20pornography%20was%2012.&amp;amp;text=iStock." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pornography exposure&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/youth-suicide-is-on-the-rise-yale-aims-to-save-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; remain shockingly high. Inside and outside the church, we’ve falsely believed that the dangers posed to developing brains by smartphones and social media can be overcome with occasional conversations or the latest parental controls, or by a “mature” teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the past decade has demonstrated that our current methodologies—however well intentioned—aren’t working to slay the digital beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&lt;em&gt; will&lt;/em&gt; work? Are these dangerous devices simply a necessary evil in our kids’ lives? Or are there more effective ways we can mitigate their influence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digital Dope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing in her new book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tech-Exit-Practical-Freeing-Smartphones/dp/059373629X/?tag=thegospcoal-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Tech Exit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Clare Morell documents how technology is like second-hand smoke: “The teen mental health crisis today is due not only to negative effects of digital technologies for individuals but also to the group social dynamics that smartphones and social media have created.” This echoes the question recently asked by Trevin Wax: “&lt;a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/scrolling-become-new-smoking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Could Scrolling Become the New Smoking?&lt;/a&gt;” With &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/passive-scrolling-linked-to-increased-anxiety-in-teens-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies showing&lt;/a&gt; increased levels of anxiety for teens who are passive scrollers, it’s time we age-restrict tablets, smartphones, and social media until adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time we age-restrict tablets, smartphones, and social media until adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Haidt’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036/?tag=thegospcoal-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Anxious Generation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; documented many of the dangers. Countries such as Australia and Sweden have responded boldly. Australia raised the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89vjj0lxx9o" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;minimum age of social media use&lt;/a&gt; to 16, and &lt;a href="https://www.government.se/articles/2024/02/government-investing-in-more-reading-time-and-less-screen-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sweden took necessary steps&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the presence of tablets and computers in schools. A year ago in my home state of Virginia, governor Glenn Youngkin introduced a measure to prohibit phone use by students during the school day. It’s going &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/02/us/school-cellphone-ban-virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;remarkably well&lt;/a&gt;, with fewer discipline issues and happier, more connected students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many people have compared smartphones to cigarettes, Patrick Miller is perhaps more accurate when he writes in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.thegospelcoalition.org/product/9781433599446/scrolling-ourselves-to-death-paperback" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Scrolling Ourselves to Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, “Your phone is a digital syringe.” Nicotine addiction may cause cancer after decades of use, but “digital dope” is leading to deaths of despair for teens and 20-somethings &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller goes on to say, “Ninety-five percent of teens between thirteen and seventeen are using digital dope, and most parents can’t bring themselves to tell them to stop, even though social media’s dangerous and addictive effects are now widely known.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can improve the mental health crisis among youth, but only if we’re willing to speak the truth. We must be bold and declare that smartphones and social media aren’t for minors. We can no longer put forward the narrative that just a little bit of digital dope is OK, so long as our kids make good grades and still attend youth group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We shouldn’t blame or ridicule parents, but we do need to call them to a higher standard. The church must be willing to say that parental controls are a red herring and that the social internet is simply incapable of replacing the goodness of in-person community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Protect Children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I spoke with a mom who relies on internet controls to safeguard her son’s smartphone. She had prohibited him from downloading apps rated ages 17+. As a well-educated, actively engaged parent, she was unaware that some apps rated ages 4+ can still include pornography and eating disorder information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App stores aren’t tethered to any real standards and lack appropriate regulations. Utah’s &lt;a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/utahs-app-store-accountability-act-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;App Store Accountability Act&lt;/a&gt; aims to rectify this, as does &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2025/05/28/governor-abbott-signs-bill-mandating-stricter-controls-for-online-app-stores-parents-and-kids-react/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recently passed legislation in Texas&lt;/a&gt;. But the other 48 states have no such laws, leaving millions of children less protected than their parents believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can no longer put forward the narrative that just a little bit of digital dope is OK, so long as our kids make good grades and still attend youth group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250306" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;FBI warning on the “764 network”&lt;/a&gt; documents how minors are targeted by a crime ring of bad actors who “manipulate or coerce victims to produce Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and other videos depicting animal cruelty and self-harm.” The FBI notes that posting photos and videos of minors puts the subjects at risk of becoming victimized. No amount of “likes” is worth this risk, not even on a church’s social media feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a new problem, though. Forty years ago, Neil Postman wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business/dp/014303653X/?tag=thegospcoal-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Amusing Ourselves to Death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “As a television show, and a good one, &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt; does not encourage children to love school or anything about school. It encourages them to love television.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, Instagram doesn’t encourage children to love community. YouTube doesn’t encourage a love of serving others. TikTok doesn’t encourage creativity. They all encourage children to love consuming content on Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. We don’t have to be against the internet in its entirety to be against minors being preyed upon by addictive, algorithm driven apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it’s not enough to say yes to a smartphone and no to social media. An internet-connected device in your son’s or daughter’s pocket allows too much, too soon. Research shows that the earlier minors receive a smartphone or tablet, &lt;a href="https://sapienlabs.org/data_gallery/?report=3901" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the worse their mental health&lt;/a&gt; will fare into early adulthood. Waiting until after high school graduation is the prudent response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach isn’t without precedent. We have age requirements on purchasing cigarettes, alcohol, and guns and on entering strip clubs. Minimum age restrictions exist for getting a driver’s license or riding in the front seat of a car. We’ve collectively agreed that some things aren’t safe for children and teens. Until our laws catch up with our needs, the church should stand in the gap and protect children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How You Can Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group in Maryland has done as much by &lt;a href="https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2023/08/postman-pledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;signing the “Postman Pledge,”&lt;/a&gt; agreeing to restrict smartphone and social media access for their children and teens. Instead, they commit to creating “deep bonds of community . . . to foster friendship among our families in the natural, traditional ways human cultures have always done.” They aren’t doing something new, but they are doing something good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t have to be against the internet in its entirety to be against minors using the social internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family has chosen to &lt;a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/dearchristianparent/p/landline-phones-because-vintage-is?r=3huc9s&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;install a landline phone&lt;/a&gt;, as have a handful of our friends. My sons use the landline to make plans with their buddies or clarify the evening’s homework assignment. Parents of their friends are accustomed to fielding calls from my children and often praise their communication skills. As some of my sons’ friends have gotten smartphones, our landline is still an effective means of communication. And I never have to worry that an app update will undo parental controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet culture’s negative influences have seeped into our homes and our churches, despite our best efforts. The narrative that we must teach kids how to use these devices well hasn’t produced much fruit. Rare is the adult who claims a healthy relationship with his or her smartphone. As followers of Christ, we must be brave enough to stand up for children and say that smartphones, tablets, and social media aren’t for minors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our kids are scrolling themselves to death, but this can end. The church can fight for children. After all, if we don’t, then who will?&lt;/p&gt;
